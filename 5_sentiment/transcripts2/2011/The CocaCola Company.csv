I'm pleased to report that once again, the Coca-Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success.

I'm pleased to report that once again, the Coca-Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success. 
In 2010, we met or exceeded all of our long-term growth targets. And we achieve these results against a backdrop of an unbalanced global economic recovery, and while completing our acquisition of CCE's North America business. 
At the same time, we once more gained volume and value share in Global Non-alcoholic Beverages. We also gained global volume in both the sparkling and still Ready-to-drink Beverage categories. Together, with our global bottling partners we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision and in advancing our momentum.
Our brands are stronger and healthier, fueled dynamically by our marketing and innovation. Brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year, the highest full year growth our wonderful flagship brand has achieved in over a decade. Our investments are rising as we keenly focused on expanding our profitable operations in a sustainable way across more than 200 markets where we do business today. 
Our business in North America is growing again. We delivered positive organic volume growth for the full year in North America. This complements the rapid and successful work we're doing to integrate our North America business, all designed to bring greater growth, profitability and value to our flagship market. And today, our system is more aligned than it has been in more than a decade. In 2010, the first year of our 2020 vision, we executed and performed as one closely coordinated global system. No question, the journey to our 2020 vision is underway.
Turning now to our performance results, I'm happy to report that our volume growth grew a strong 6% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit of our new cross license brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America, our quarterly volume growth was a strong 5%. This was fueled by organic volume growth in every one of our five geographic operating groups. As for the full year, we also grew our global volume 5%, again ahead of our long-term growth target and delivered over $1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth. That is more than the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business.
We increased fourth quarter net revenues 45% on a comparable neutral basis. For the full year, we grew comparable currency neutral net revenue in line with our long-term growth target, even after excluding the benefit of structural changes, principally due to the CCE transaction and the benefit of the new cross license brands. 
This quarter, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year and is at the high end of our long-term growth target. On a full year basis, we delivered comparable earnings per share growth of 14%, well ahead of our long-term growth target.
And our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 10%. This brings our full year comparable currency neutral operating income to 11%, also above our long-term growth target. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive year we have either met or exceeded our long-term profit growth targets.
These strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance result further strengthened the foundation of our business and provide us with great momentum as we embark in 2011, the second year of our journey to 2020.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 8% this quarter, with organic volume growth of 3%, excluding the benefit of our new to cross license brands. This was North America's third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a full year basis, our North America volume was up 2% and organic volume was up 1% excluding again the benefit of our new cross license brands. 
At the same time, this past quarter, we completed the acquisition of CCE's North America business on plan and on schedule. Today, we are very pleased to report that are new operating structure and our leadership teams are well in place, and that our integration efforts are proceeding exactly as planned.
Sparkling Beverages in North America, excluding the benefit of our new cross license brands, were up 1% in the quarter and even for the full year. Including the benefit of our cross license brands, North America Sparkling Beverages were up 8% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Importantly, North America grew Sparkling volume and value share for the quarter and full year versus the total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. Trademark Coca-Cola in North America was up 1% in the quarter, led by Coke Zero, which delivered double-digit volume growth for the 19th consecutive quarter. Sprite had a third consecutive quarter of positive growth up 4% for the quarter, and 2% for the full year. Fanta also delivered positive growth for the quarter and the full year.
We also extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers. This game-changing innovation is now available in more than 400 locations across 20 U.S. markets, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. Plans for further expansion in 2011 are well on track with availability expected to reach more than 80 U.S. markets by the end of 2011.  All of these developments reaffirm the fact that our system is executing the right strategies to sustainably drive growth across our entire North America Sparkling Beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America Still beverages, I'm pleased to report a strong 7% increase for the quarter, and 5% growth for the full year. We have now grown volume share for our Still beverages for 12 of the past 14 quarters and value share for 13 of the last 14 quarters. Our North America Juice and Juice Drink business delivered positive full year growth of 2%. This was fueled by our Simply brand up double digits for the full year. 
In the North America Tea category, we saw 11% growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year, led by Gold Peak which more than doubled its volume in 2010. Our glac√©au brands grew 19% in the quarter, and our vitaminwater trademark growth up double digits was led by the further expansion of vitaminwater Zero.  In addition, smartwater delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth.
POWERADE was up a solid 20% in the quarter, as performing to the North American Sports Drink category and gaining share versus our primary competitor for the ninth consecutive quarter. For the full year, POWERADE delivered strong 19% growth, including over 60% full year growth for POWERADE Zero, our innovative zero calories sports drink.
These strong results in North America are a testament to our long held belief that through strong marketing and focused execution, we can accelerate our leadership position within North America and drive profitable and sustainable growth in our flagship market.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa. This operating group saw broad-based growth, up 14% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Once again, all nine business units in this operating group delivered positive volume growth. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola was up 12% for the quarter and up 10% for the full year, benefiting from our strategic investments across the entire region. This strong performance in Eurasia and Africa was led by Russia, up 31% this quarter and finishing the full year up 16%. We once again outperformed the market in Russia this quarter, led by the continued strong performance of our core sparkling brands.  Brand Coca-Cola in Russia was up 37%, for the quarter, and up 26% for the full year. This performance represents the largest ever single year incremental volume growth for brand Coca-Cola in Russia.  It is no surprise, therefore, that Coca-Cola was recently awarded the Best Soft Drink of the year at Russia's Brand of the Year Award ceremony. As such, we believe we are ideally positioned to outperform our primary international competitor in Russia. 
India, meanwhile, returned to double-digit growth, up 12% in the fourth quarter and 17% on a full year basis. This market has now achieved double-digit growth in nine of the last quarters. And India captured share growth across our Sparkling and Still portfolio in both the quarter and on a full year basis. This shows demonstrates that India delivering high-quality growth consistently across our entire portfolio rather than relying on select growth from any single category.
Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, both up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. In fact, our brands now represents four of the top five sparkling brands in India. And our Still beverages growth in India benefited from the further expansion of our Maaza juice brand, up double-digits in the quarter and for the full year.
We also grow double digits in both the quarter and the full year in Turkey, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. As for performance in Africa, South Africa delivered 8% unit case volume growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, building on our momentum coming out of last summer's FIFA World Cup activation programs, as well as our ongoing in-market investments.  We also saw double-digit growth in east and central Africa and high single-digit growth in north and west Africa, providing a very strong and consistent finish to our full year performance throughout the African continent.
Moving to our Pacific group, overall volume growth was up 1% in the fourth quarter, cycling 11% from the previous year, bringing our full year volume growth 6%. These results were driven by second consecutive quarter of positive growth for Japan, which was up 2% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This growth in Japan was widespread across our beverage portfolio. Leading the way was Coca-Cola trademark, up 5% in Japan this quarter, a fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. On a full year basis, Coca-Cola trademark was also up 5%, making this the fourth consecutive year Coca-Cola trademark has grown 3% or more in Japan.  We are encouraged by the recent momentum in this highly profitable developed market. But having said that, we remain cautious about the current and ongoing economic challenges in Japan.
Turning to China, our full year volume grew 6%, with fourth quarter volume down 3%. You will recall this quarter that we are cycling 29% volume growth from the prior year. As we indicated in our first quarter 2010 earnings call, it is not uncommon to see quarter-to-quarter volume swings in China. This is especially true between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of every year, given that fluctuating end of the year trading activity, driven by the very timing of Chinese New Year. That said, our Sparkling Beverages and Juice and Juice Drinks captured volume and value share in China in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, 2010, we grew our business in China by over $100 million incremental unit cases, our seventh consecutive year of achieving this level of incremental unit case growth. Accumulatively over the last two years, we've expanded our volume in China by 24%, significantly widening the gap with our primary international competitor. Over the same two-year time period, our compounded annual growth rate in China was 11% in line with our long-term double-digit growth objectives for China.
This last quarter of 2010 marked a significant milestone for our business in China as Minute Maid Pulpy, a brand borne and launched in China achieved $1 billion brand status in only five years. Minute Maid Pulpy is now our company's 14th $1 billion brand. The rapid scalability of the Pulpy brand across other markets is actually a testament or systems ability to rapidly adapt and scale brand innovation from any part of the world.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are adopting our in-market strategies to make sure we keep building on our strong foundation and remain well-positioned to win in China between now and 2020. As more remote areas of China experience accelerated economic growth, we are investing heavily to expand the scale of our distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, we opened three new plants to further enhance our ability to serve China's growing consumer and customer base.
As the retail trade in the coastal regions further evolves from traditional local outlets to newer and larger channels, we're also investing heavily to grow in the hyper and supermarket channels. And as the Chinese consumer demand increasingly and as the Chinese consumer demand increasingly vary and sophisticate offerings, we are innovating and introducing a wider variety of packaged choices that will drive increased transactions and build brand equity.  Our team in China is executing all of these strategic actions to build greater brands across categories to drive strong and sustainable growth in this important market.  As we said before, the real measure of our success in China will be how we continue to seize growth opportunities in that region between now and 2020. While we may see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we're confident that we have the right strategies, the right execution plans and the right capabilities in place today, and are better-positioned than our competitors to deliver long-term sustainable double-digit growth in China.
Our positive full year results in Japan and China were further complemented by our performance across the region, for example, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea and Vietnam each grew double digits for the full year. These four specific countries combined grew well over $100 million incremental unit cases in 2010. This demonstrates the strength and value of our Pacific group's broad geographic portfolio.
In addition, Brazil, Russia, India and China, commonly referred to as the BRIC nations, grew 10% as a whole for the full year. It is worth noting that these four BRIC countries represented over $400 million cases of incremental growth in 2010, or almost 40% of our company's total incremental volume growth for the year.
Moving now to Latin America, volume grew a steady 5% for both the quarter and the full year. We also gained volume and value share in the total Nonalcoholic Ready-to-drink Beverages, as well as Sparkling and Still beverages. This broad-based growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full year. Brazil delivered strong results, with volume up 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total Non-alcoholic Ready-To-Drink beverages. Mexico volume was up 8% for the quarter and 3% for the full year as weather conditions normalized from the previous quarter. Mexico has now gained nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages volume shares from 13 of the last 16 quarters and value share for 16 consecutive quarters. Our South Latin business which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered mid-single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, rounding out another solid and consistent year for our Latin America operating group.
Moving to Europe, we saw positive growth in the quarter despite ongoing economic challenges. Volume was up 2% for the quarter and even for the full year. Our performance in Sparkling beverages in Europe was led by trademark Coca-Cola up 2% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Our Still beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with Tea up 9% and Energy Drinks up double digits. France was up mid-single digits for both the quarter and the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of positive growth in this key developed market. Additionally, trademark Coca-Cola was up 5% for the full year.  Great Britain delivered low single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, supported by growth across both our Sparkling and Still beverage portfolios. 
And while economic challenges remain across many parts of Europe, we're starting to see initial signs of recovery. In fact, several Central European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saw double-digit growth in the quarter, and others such as Romania, Switzerland, Austria, grew mid- to high-single-digits in the third quarter. And Germany was the year up its first full year of positive volume growth since 2007. Importantly, we gained volume and value share in Germany to both the quarter and the full year.
Now let's turn to an overview of our brands and their performance. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across each and every one of the 206 countries around the globe. As a result for the total company, our Sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter, excluding the benefit of the new cross license brands, with international Sparkling beverage volume up 4%. Coca-Cola Zero continues to be one of our fastest growing global sparkling beverages. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success in North America. In fact, this momentum extends around the world, with Coca-Cola Zero up 9% for the quarter and up 7% for the full year across our international markets. And in 2010, Fanta grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year, and became our company's third brand to surpass $2 billion annual unit case sales, along with Coca-Cola and Sprite.
We're also successfully expanding our global Still beverage portfolio. Total worldwide Still beverages unit case volume increased 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year, led by the further expansion of our global Juice and Juice Drinks and Sports Drinks businesses. In 2010, we grew our overall Juice and Juice Drink business and by double digits in the quarter and 9% for the full year. These results build on a very successful decade for our global Juice and Juice Drink business, which delivered a compounded annual growth rate of greater than 9% over the past decade. 
Our global Sports Drink business registered a very strong result in 2010, up 14% for the full year. These results, driven by our global FIFA World Cup programs, were balanced across key geographies, including North America, Japan, Spain and Mexico.
We also saw ongoing success with the global expansion of vitaminwater with international sales nearly doubling in 2010. Vitaminwater is now present in 20 international markets, with plans to launch into four new markets in the first quarter of 2011.  This great momentum in our brand portfolio is further supported by our balanced customer growth plans and our disciplined execution culture. For example, our full year results with our top 10 global retail customers saw high single-digit volume and revenue growth. 
Our sales of Immediate Consumption beverages grew 4% for the full year, driven by our focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2010 with more than 1/3 of these placed in China, India and Brazil.
We're also focused on expanding our right execution daily for Red program. Red is our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the output level. Our internal pilot studies show that bottlers implementing Red saw an average volume growth of more than 10% over the life of the pilot period. Today, operations representing nearly a quarter of our global volume utilize Red. And going forward, this program will be an area of increasing emphasis in growth for our system.
Our results across operations and with our customers around the world point to a well-aligned and focused global Coca-Cola system, vigorously and passionately executing a common set of strategies and delivering on our 2020 Vision. 
One of the ways we established such a strong foundation in 2010 was through innovative and world-class methods. We engage and connect with our consumers each and every single day. Last December for example, we accomplished our most ambitious social media project ever named Expedition 206. Over 365 days, three Coca-Cola happiness ambassadors, traveled more than 275,000 miles and visited 186 countries on a mission to seek out and document sources of happiness around the world.  Our happiness ambassadors brought their adventure to life for fans and followers in realtime across social networking sites, bringing millions of people together in a way that only a brand with Coca-Cola's global reach could hope to accomplish. One of the sites in which the story came to life was our Coca-Cola Facebook fan page, where we currently have over 22 million fans, making us the most popular consumer brand page on Facebook.
And to put this in perspective, 22 million Coca-Cola fans is roughly equivalent to the average viewership of American Idol, one of the television's most popular programs. And our Facebook fan page is growing each and every week, with over 75% of our current fan base under the age of 25. This is another great example of how we are successfully engaging and building brand love with a whole new generation of consumers.
As we further build our business momentum across the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we announced that we are expanding our collaboration with international Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world's largest humanitarian agency. Together, with our global bottling partners, we worked with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in more than 50 countries. This partnership has helped provide disaster relief immediately after earthquakes in Haiti, Italy, China and Pakistan, droughts in Kenya, and more recently, flooding in Australia. We are proud to partner with this great organization to extend its worldwide reach.  I'd like to invite all of you to visit our website to learn more about these and many other initiatives and programs we have in place to advance our sustainability goals and efforts.
2011 marks the 125th anniversary of Coca-Cola, a refreshing and affordable luxury available to consumers everywhere for just cents at a time. However, Coca-Cola's 125 journey is actually testament to our youth, not our age. There's something special about our enterprise that is in a state of constant renewal and dynamic growth. As we begin the second year of our 2020 Vision, we do so from a position of real strength and real momentum.  
We see opportunities ahead as exciting as those our predecessors must have seen 125 years ago, and we intend to capitalize on these opportunities by first investing further in our marketing, sales and infrastructure capability; secondly I advancing our sustainability efforts to drive our business and to extend our social license to operate everywhere; third, by embedding ourselves even further into our customers' growth strategies; and last but not least, by continuing to innovate across every aspect of our global enterprise.
Whether you've been a part of our journey for most of our 125-year history or a more recent investor, we sincerely thank you for your trust and confidence in our business.  As we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain relevantly focus on advancing our global momentum to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for you and all of our shareholders.
So with that, let me just turn the call over to Gary. Thank you."
26642,117038676,100792,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our volume and profit results were in line with or ex",2337,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming that our global leadership teams across our system are executing the right strategic plans to achieve our 2020 Vision. Today, we will discuss our comparable currency-neutral results for the fourth quarter and the full year. This is consistent with how we've historically communicated our results as in our opinion this provides a complete picture of our underlying business performance. 
That said, before going into the details of our financial highlights, we acknowledge that this quarter's comparable currency-neutral results include significant structural changes principally related to our recent CCE transaction. For this reason, we're also providing the net impact of these structural changes to help you better understand our results and our performance in relation to our long-term growth targets.
To be clear, when we refer to the impact of structural items, these include the acquisition of CCE's North American operations, new cross license brands, principally Dr. Pepper, the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottlers, the elimination of CCE equity income and some other smaller structural items.
So let's start with our earnings results. As outlined in our release this morning, we reported comparable earnings per share for the quarter of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year. As we shared during our December 2010 modeling call, excluding the impact of one-time items, we anticipated that our recent transaction with CCE would be slightly dilutive to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. Today, we confirm that our transaction with CCE was in fact diluted by $0.02 per share to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. 
For the quarter, our comparable currency-neutral net revenues were up 45%, driven by strong 6% increase in concentrate sales, 2% positive price mix and a 37% benefit from structural items. Our full year comparable currency-neutral net revenues increased 14%. This growth was composed of a 5% increase in concentrate sales in line with unit case sales, 1% positive price mix and an 8% benefit from structural items. This 1% full year price mix result came in just slightly ahead of our full year outlook, sustaining a year-long trend of sequential improvement. This reflects the recent strength of our developed markets, which helped offset the impact of expected and ongoing geographic mix, given growth in our emerging and developing markets. 
As for 2011, it would be reasonable to expect positive price mix results consistent with that as implied by our long-term growth targets.
We delivered consistent gross profit growth with our comparable currency-neutral gross profit increasing 36% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, including a structural benefit of 28% in the quarter and 7% in the full year. It's important to note that all five of our geographic operating groups have positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth for the full year. As for our comparable currency neutral operating income, this grew 10% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. This benefit from structural items was 3% in the quarter and 1% in the full year.
Currency had a 1% positive impact on operating income in the quarter and 3% positive impact in the full year, which results in comparable operating income growth of 11% for the quarter and 14% for the full year.
Comparable currency-neutral cost of goods sold increased 60% in the quarter, primarily driven by 52% increase related to structural changes. Comparable currency-neutral cost of goods sold increased 15% for the full year, reflecting a 12% increase related to structural changes, bringing our full year cost of goods result in line with outlook we provided in our last earnings call.
Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses increased 52% for the quarter, including a 45% impact related to structural items. These results were in line with our expectations and primarily driven by continued investment in our bottling operations, the timing of marketing expenses versus the prior year and higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs.
For the full year, comparable currency-neutral SG&A were up 16%, including a 12% impact related to structural items. With regards to operating expense leverage, please remember that we're referring to the point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth of a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items.
For the full year, comparable currency-neutral operating expense leverage was in line with our expectations down three points, which includes an adverse six-point impact due to the impact of the structural items. Our healthy operating results across each and every one of our operating groups helped drive our cash flow from operations, up 16% to $9.5 billion. 
For the full year 2010, we repurchased $3.1 billion in company stock, which is more than the $2 billion we indicated in our last earnings call. Given the performance of our stock in 2010, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs at year end. Therefore we ramped up our repurchases in response to that stock option activity. While many of you rightly decreased our year-end share count in your models due to our previously announced share repurchase plans, this greater stock option program activity resulted in our share count, actually remaining almost constant at  year end.  This higher year-end share count versus your model expectations equates to an earnings per share impact of between $0.01 and $0.02. 
As for 2011, we expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year, and we'll update you on our progress during future quarterly earnings calls. 
Now let me take a minute to follow up on some of the items we called out during our December 2010 modeling conference call. First, we referenced that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we would benefit from an estimated $5 billion, one-time, non-cash gain related to the revaluing of our CCE shares at the closing date fair value. We can now confirm today that this benefit did indeed result in a one-time gain of approximately $5 billion. I'll remind you that this one-time gain does not impact comparable earnings results. 
In our December 2010 call, we also mentioned that we would incur a transaction-related gross profit in inventory and fair value adjustment to our cost of goods in the fourth quarter based on our inventory levels at year end, and I can confirm that this adjustment impacted our fourth quarter results by $235 million. 
Now let me provide some further updates on a few factors we see impacting our 2011 results.  First, we expect to see some different phasing of revenue and gross profit capture in upcoming quarters. As we explained in our December call, prior to the transaction with CCE, revenue and profit related to the sale of our products was recognized when our concentrate shipped to CCE, which we reported as concentrate sales, or in the case of our finished goods product at the time we shipped to finished goods to CCE. Now that we own the manufacturing and distribution assets to produce and sell these products, the revenue tied to their sale, and therefore their associated concentrate profit, is not recognized until they're sold as physical cases. For example, last year, most of our pre-Easter holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our first quarter 2010 results. This year, most of our Easter holiday-related finished goods sales will likely follow the second quarter 2011 results.
And last year, most of our pre-July 4 holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our second quarter 2010 results. This year much of our July 4 holiday related finished goods sales were likely fall in the third quarter of 2011 results. With regard to commodities, our recent acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in an adjustment to our company's overall cost structure, especially in North America. Today, approximately 35% of our total company's cost of goods is made up of both the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following four inputs: Sweeteners, metals, juices and PET. As you would expect, the bulk of these cost reside within our North American and Bottling Investment Group businesses. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue facing pressure and volatility in today's marketplace. As a result, we expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity cost on our total company results to range between $300 billion and $400 billion. 
As per our comments during our December call, prior to the close of our transaction with CCE, we were precluded from hedging the exposures associated with these commodities. We are now actively hedging many of these commodity exposures, much like we traditionally have done with global currencies where we have a history of prudently managing exposure. In addition, it's important to note that many of our derivatives related to these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP requirements, and therefore, we are required to recognize the unrealized change in fair value of the derivatives in our results. As such, our reported results now reflect any associated unrealized gains or losses related to these hedging activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the unrealized gain related to our hedging activities for CCR commodity exposures that did not qualify for hedge accounting was $29 million. We have excluded this gain from our comparable fourth quarter 2010 earnings, even though including it would would've improved our fourth quarter comparable earnings as we felt this was the right thing to do in order to provide you with a better understanding of our operating results. 
We've called out this $29 million gain in our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules and will reflect these gains in future comparable earnings in the same period that we realize a corresponding change in value of the underlying exposure.
A related question some of you have asked with regards to the recent rise in commodity prices is the corresponding impact this may have on our 2011 pricing strategies. I can assure you that our long-term pricing strategy remains unchanged. Simply said, our goal is to always provide consumers with the right product at the right time, in the right package and at the right price. In this way, we will keep driving sustainable volume and value growth in every market and category in which we compete. 
Now let me provide an initial outlook on currencies, including the impact from our hedged positions and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year and in the first quarter of 2011. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A expenses in 2011. Further we reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of cost synergies related to our CCE transaction this year. 
Further, we remain well on plan and on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of this year. And while we continue to cycle the benefits of these ongoing productivity initiatives, we expect to capture positive operating expense leverage in 2011, consistent with what is implied by our long-term growth targets. 
From a capital expenditure standpoint, and as I discussed during our December call, our annual capital expenditure needs will increase in 2011 as we incorporate CCE's former North American operations. As I also mentioned during our December 2010 call, we plan to make additional investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness, the net results of this North American specific expenditures will be an increase of approximately $1 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program.
In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments Group. As a result, we expect our 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion.
Finally, with regard to our tax rate, please note that the variances between our reported and underlying tax rates for both the fourth quarter and full year was due to the impact of various items affecting comparability, the most significant of which was the $5 billion one time non-cash gain related to the CCE transaction that I discussed earlier. Looking ahead to 2011, our current best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will range between $23.5% and 24.5 %. 
Before I close my prepared remarks this morning, some of you have asked us to provide additional commentary regarding our long-term growth targets. First of all, we have always viewed these targets as multiyear or long-term targets. We run our business with an aim toward achieving the highest returns for our shareholders overtime. This philosophy has served us well in the past, and we believe is the right way to run a sustainable, productive and dynamic business. This, however, does not mean that we do not closely monitor our quarterly results. As we manage our business quarter-to-quarter, our focus is much more on understanding and identifying short-term macroeconomic trends that may call for us to adjust our short-term tactics as we execute our long-term strategies. And while we often compare our annual performance results alongside our long-term growth targets, our most important consideration is ensuring that every year, we make the right long-term decisions to attain our goals, to achieve our 2020 Vision and beyond. 
In closing, our strong 2010 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our company's long-term currency-neutral growth rate which are and have been 3% to 4% volume growth, 5% to 6% revenue growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and a high single digits earnings per share growth.

This is Muhtar. I think what you can look at is what's driving that growth. And I think what's driving that growth is really and still a somewhat mixed economy around the world, challenging economy around the world is the alignment that we're executing with our bottlers, the alignment that we have to strengthen alignment the investments of the be making in our brands in our infrastructure over the past not just the year but multiple years, the strength of the brands, the strength of the geographic portfolio, all of that is coming to the four, I think, in terms of what you're seeing. Now again, in terms of the world economy, Gary mentioned commodities, there's currency also in terms of the challenge, inflation coming out of commodities, political issues, uncertainties in some parts of the world as we've seen recently. The incredible amount of cash just sitting on the sidelines about $2 trillion just in the United States, generally still some lack of confidence. But at the same time, as I mentioned, in 2009, we saw a tremendously difficult environment in some parts like Russia, Eastern Europe. We see some signs of improvement in certain parts of the world, better than they've been in the past and many emerging markets continue to grow. And consumer confidence is good in many of the emerging markets. So I think as we execute our long-term strategy, as we build on our momentum, our strategy is working and that's what you're seeing coming out with a 5% organic growth in our business for the full year. And again, north of $1 billion unit cases added to our business, which we feel good about in terms of what has been achieved in 2010. But we remain resolutely focused on our execution and continue to drive results with our bottling partners."

And then Gary, just a little more color on the CapEx piece, your run rate on CapEx for 2011 will actually be sort of greater than your incoming trend, plus all of CCE's CapEx.

We will have positive pricing in North America in 2011 as well. What we're trying to say is that basically, our pricing will be rational but it will also be pricing that's rational, not only in terms of competitors in the competitive marketplace, but also rational pricing in terms of the consumer. And there, we would much rather -- in rational, I mean take -- let's say not react totally to short-term volatility in commodities, but take more consistent rational pricing over a period of time over a number of years, which we believe is the right thing for our customers, it's the right thing for our consumers. And in fact will return much greater value to us and actually to the beverage industry over a longer period of time. So we're being very rational about it, we'll take our price and we are increasing pricing in 2011 in North America. So I can confirm that directly. Relative to CapEx, the increase from, in fact the CapEx, if you look at it, was about $2.2 billion in 2010. And we're talking about going to $3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2011. CCE North America, legacy CCE North America was around $600 million, $650 million. There is a large piece of that increase then from let's say from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $3.2 billion to a large part of that more than half I would actually is incremental CapEx that is related to the integration efforts of CCE North America in sales it is a lot of it is IT and having rationalizing the various systems it is all within North America in the same systems. Those types of things will. In fact what I would expect you will see is over the next couple of years, those investments actually will peak over about two years or they'll start going back down. Then we do have some real opportunities to increase both production and sales execution in a lot of our work. BIG markets, which are growing rapidly as Muhtar talked about in his section. So we're continuing to increase there, as I say both in production capacity as well as sales execution capability and cold drink equipment et cetera in those markets to continue to invest in the long-term. And then back to the question asked earlier by Carlos, over some period of time a lot of those bottlers will actually be we franchise and you see CapEx go down again relative to that."

I'm pleased to report that once again, the Coca-Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success. 
In 2010, we met or exceeded all of our long-term growth targets. And we achieved these results against a backdrop of an unbalanced global economic recovery and while completing our acquisition of CCE's North America business. 
At the same time, we once more gained volume and value share in Global non-alcoholic beverages. We also gained global volume in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. Together, with our global bottling partners, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision and are advancing our momentum.
Our brands are stronger and healthier, fueled dynamically by our marketing and innovation. Brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year, the highest full year growth our wonderful flagship brand has achieved in over a decade. Our investments are rising as we keenly focused on expanding our profitable operations in a sustainable way across more than 200 markets where we do business today. 
Our business in North America is growing again. We delivered positive organic volume growth for the full year in North America. This complements the rapid and successful work we're doing to integrate our North America business, all designed to bring greater growth, profitability and value to our flagship market. And today, our system is more aligned than it has been in a decade. In 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision, we executed and performed as one closely coordinated global system. No question, the journey to our 2020 Vision is underway.
Turning now to our performance results. I'm happy to report that our volume growth grew a strong 6% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America, our quarterly volume growth was a strong 5%. This was fueled by organic volume growth in every one of our five geographic operating groups. 
As for the full year, we also grew our global volume 5%, again ahead of our long-term growth target and delivered over $1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth. That is more than the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business.
We increased fourth quarter net revenues 45% on a comparable currency neutral basis. For the full year, we grew comparable currency neutral net revenues 14% in line with our long-term growth target, even after excluding the benefit of structural changes, principally due to the CCE transaction and the benefit of new cross-licensed brand. 
This quarter, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year and at the high end of our long-term growth target. On a full year basis, we delivered comparable earnings per share growth of 14%, well ahead of our long-term growth target.
And our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 10%. This brings our full year comparable currency neutral operating income to 11%, also above our long-term growth target. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive year we have either met or exceeded our long-term profit growth target.
These strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance results further strengthened the foundation of our business and provide us with great momentum as we embark on 2011, the second year of our journey to 2020.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 8% this quarter, with organic volume growth of 3%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This was North America's third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a full year basis, our North America volume was up 2% and organic volume was up 1%, excluding again the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. 
The same time, this past quarter, we completed the acquisition of CCE's North America business on plan and on schedule. Today, we're very pleased to report that our new operating structure and our leadership teams are well in place, and that our integration efforts are proceeding exactly as planned.
Sparkling beverages in North America, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, were up 1% in the quarter and even for the full year. Including the benefit of our cross-licensed brands, North America sparkling beverages were up 8% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Importantly, North America grew sparkling volume and value share for the quarter and full year versus the total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. Trademark Coca-Cola in North America was up 1% in the quarter, led by Coke Zero, which delivered double-digit volume growth for the 19th consecutive quarter. Sprite had a third consecutive quarter of positive growth up 4% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fanta also delivered positive growth for the quarter and the full year.
We also extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers. This game-changing innovation is now available in more than 400 locations across 20 U.S. markets, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. Plans for further expansion in 2011 are well on track with availability expected to reach more than 80 U.S. markets by the end of 2011.  All of these developments reaffirm the fact that our system is executing the right strategies to sustainably drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report a strong 7% increase for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 12 of the past 14 quarters and value share for 13 of the last 14 quarters. Our North America Juices and Juice Drink business delivered positive full year growth of 2%. This was fueled by our Simply brand up double-digits for the full year. 
In the North America Tea category, we saw 11% growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year, led by Gold Peak, which more than doubled its volume in 2010. Our glac√©au brands grew 19% in the quarter, and our vitaminwater trademark growth up double digits was led by the further expansion of vitaminwater zero.  In addition, smartwater delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth.
POWERade was up a solid 20% in the quarter, outperforming the North America's sports drinks category and gaining share versus our primary competitor for the ninth consecutive quarter. For the full year, POWERade delivered strong 19% growth, including over 60% full year growth for POWERade Zero, our innovative zero calories sports drink.
These strong results in North America are a testament to our long-held belief that through strong marketing and focused execution, we can accelerate our leadership position within North America and drive profitable and sustainable growth in our flagship market.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa. This operating group saw broad-based growth, up 14% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Once again, all nine business units in this operating group delivered positive volume growth. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola was up 12% for the quarter and up 10% for the full year, benefiting from our strategic investments across the entire region. This strong performance in Eurasia and Africa was led by Russia, up 31% this quarter and finishing the full year up 16%. We once again outperformed the market in Russia this quarter, led by the continued strong performance of our core sparkling brands. Brand Coca-Cola in Russia was up 37%, for the quarter and up 26% for the full year. This performance represents the largest ever single-year incremental volume growth for brand Coca-Cola in Russia.  It is no surprise therefore that Coca-Cola was recently awarded the Best Soft Drink of the Year at Russia's Brand of the Year Award ceremony. As such, we believe we are ideally positioned to outperform our primary international competitor in Russia. 
India, meanwhile, returned to double-digit growth, up 12% in the fourth quarter and 17% on a full year basis. This market has now achieved double-digit growth in nine of the last quarters. And India captured share growth across our sparkling and still portfolio in both the quarter and on a full year basis. This shows, demonstrates that India is delivering high-quality growth consistently across our entire portfolio rather than relying on select growth from any single category.
Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, both up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. In fact, our brands now represents four of the top five sparkling brands in India. And our still beverage growth in India benefited from the further expansion of our Maaza juice brand, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year.
We also grew double digits in both the quarter and the full year in Turkey, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. As for performance in Africa, South Africa delivered 8% unit case volume growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, building on our momentum coming out of last summer's FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing in-market investments. We also saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and high single-digit growth in North and West Africa, providing a very strong and consistent finish to our full year performance throughout the African continent.
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 1% in the fourth quarter, cycling 11% from the previous year, bringing our full year volume growth to 6%. These results were driven by a second consecutive quarter of positive growth for Japan, which was up 2% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This growth in Japan was widespread across our beverage portfolio. Leading the way was Coca-Cola trademark, up 5% in Japan this quarter, a fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. On a full year basis, Coca-Cola trademark was also up 5%, making this the fourth consecutive year Coca-Cola trademark has grown 3% or more in Japan.  We are encouraged by the recent momentum in this highly profitable developed market. But having said that, we remain cautious about the current and ongoing economic challenges in Japan.
Turning to China. Our full year volume grew 6%, with fourth quarter volume down 3%. You will recall this quarter that we are cycling 29% volume growth from the prior year. As we indicated in our first quarter 2010 earnings call, it is not uncommon to see quarter-to-quarter volume swings in China. This is especially true between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of every year, given that fluctuating end of year trading activity, driven by the very timing of Chinese New Year. That said, our Sparkling Beverages and Juice and Juice Drinks captured volume and value share in China in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, 2010, we grew our business in China by over $100 million incremental unit cases, our seventh consecutive year of achieving this level of incremental unit case growth. And cumulatively over the last two years, we've expanded our volume in China by 24%, significantly widening the gap with our primary international competitor. Over the same two-year time period, our compounded annual growth rate in China was 11%, in line with our long term double-digit growth objectives for China.
This last quarter of 2010 marked a significant milestone for our business in China as Minute Maid Pulpy, a brand born and launched in China achieved $1 billion brand status in only five years. Minute Maid Pulpy is now our company's 14th billion-dollar brand. The rapid scalability of the Pulpy brand across 18 other markets is actually a testament to our systems' ability to rapidly adopt and scale brand innovation from any part of the world.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are adapting our in-market strategies to make sure that we keep building on our strong foundation and remain well positioned to win in China between now and 2020. As more remote areas of China experience accelerated economic growth, we are investing heavily to expand the scale of our distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, we opened three new plants to further enhance our ability to serve China's growing consumer and customer base.
As the retail trade in the coastal regions further evolves from traditional local outlets to newer and larger channels, we're also investing heavily to grow in the hyper and supermarket channels. And as the Chinese consumer demands increasingly varied and sophisticated offerings, we are innovating and introducing a wider variety of packaged choices that will drive increased transactions and build brand equity.  
Our team in China is executing all of these strategic actions to build greater brands across categories to drive strong and sustainable growth in this important market. As we've said before, the real measure of our success in China will be how we continue to seize growth opportunities in that region between now and 2020. While we may see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we're confident that we have the right strategy, the right execution plans and the right capabilities in place today, and are better positioned than our competitors to deliver long-term sustainable double-digit growth in China.
Our positive full year results in Japan and China were further complemented by our performance across the region. For example, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea and Vietnam each grew double digits for the full year. These four specific countries combined grew well over $100 million incremental unit cases in 2010. This demonstrates the strength and value of our Pacific Group's broad geographic portfolio.
In addition, Brazil, Russia, India and China, commonly referred to as the BRIC nations, grew 10% as a whole for the full year. It is worth noting that these four BRIC countries represented over $400 million cases of incremental growth in 2010 or almost 40% of our company's total incremental volume growth for the year.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a steady 5% for both the quarter and the full year. We also gained volume and value share in the total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling and still beverages. This broad-based growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Brazil delivered strong results, with volume up 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. 
Mexico volume was up 8% for the quarter and 3% for the full year as weather conditions normalized from the previous quarter. Mexico has now gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share from 15 of the last 16 quarters and value share for 16 consecutive quarters. Our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered mid-single digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, rounding out another solid and consistent year for our Latin America operating group.
Moving to Europe, we saw positive growth in the quarter despite ongoing economic challenges. Volume was up 2% for the quarter and even for the full year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by trademark Coca-Cola up 2% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Our still beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with tea up 9% and energy drinks up double digits. 
France was up mid-single digits for both the quarter and the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of positive growth in this key developed market. Additionally, trademark Coca-Cola was up 5% for the full year. Great Britain delivered low single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, supported by growth across both our sparkling and still beverage portfolios. 
And while economic challenges remain across many parts of Europe, we're starting to see initial signs of recovery. In fact, several Central European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saw double-digit growth in the quarter, and others such as Romania, Switzerland, Austria, grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. And Germany closed the year up 1% its first full year of positive volume growth since 2007. Importantly, we gained volume and value share in Germany to both the quarter and the full year.
Now let's turn to an overview of our brands and their performance. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across each and every one of the 206 countries around the globe. As a result for the total company, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter, excluding the benefit of new cross-licensed brands, with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. 
Coca-Cola Zero continues to be one of our fastest growing global sparkling beverages. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success in North America. In fact, this momentum extends around the world with Coca-Cola Zero up 9% for the quarter and up 7% for the full year across our international markets. And in 2010, Fanta grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year and became our company's third brand to surpass $2 billion annual unit case sales, along with Coca-Cola and Sprite.
We're also successfully expanding our global still beverage portfolio. Total worldwide still beverage unit case volume increased 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year, led by the further expansion of our global Juice and Juice Drinks and Sports Drinks businesses. In 2010, we grew our overall Juice and Juice Drink business by double digits in the quarter and 9% for the full year. These results build on a very successful decade for our global Juice and Juice Drink business, which delivered a compounded annual growth rate of greater than 9% over the past decade. 
Our global Sports Drink business registered a very strong result in 2010, up 14% for the full year. These results, driven by our global FIFA World Cup programs, were balanced across key geographies, including North America, Japan, Spain and Mexico.
We also saw ongoing success with the global expansion of vitaminwater with international sales nearly doubling in 2010. vitaminwater is now present in 20 international markets, with plans to launch into four new markets in the first quarter of 2011.  This great momentum in our brand portfolio is further supported by a balanced customer-growth plans and our disciplined execution culture. For example, our full year results with our top 10 global retail customers saw high single-digit volume and revenue growth. 
Our sales of immediate-consumption beverages grew 4% for the full year, driven by our focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2010 with more than 1/3 of these placed in China, India and Brazil.
We're also focused on expanding our right execution daily for Red program. Red is our world class commercial process designed to improve execution at the output level. Our internal pilot studies show that bottlers implementing Red saw an average volume growth of more than 10% over the life of the pilot period. Today, operations representing nearly a quarter of our global volume utilize Red. And going forward, this program will be an area of increasing emphasis and growth for our system.
Our results across operations and with our customers around the world point to a well-aligned and focused global Coca-Cola system, vigorously and passionately executing a common set of strategies and delivering on our 2020 Vision. 
One of the ways we established such a strong foundation in 2010 was through the innovative and world-class methods: We engage and connect with our consumers each and every single day. Last December for example, we accomplished our most ambitious social media project ever named Expedition 206. Over 365 days, three Coca-Cola Happiness Ambassadors, traveled more than 275,000 miles and visited 186 countries on a mission to seek out and document sources of happiness around the world. Our Happiness Ambassadors brought their adventure to life for fans and followers in real time across social networking sites, bringing millions of people together in a way that only a brand with Coca-Cola's global reach could hope to accomplish. One of the sites in which the story came to life was our Coca-Cola Facebook fan page, where we currently have over 22 million fans, making us the most popular consumer brand page on Facebook.
And to put this in perspective, 22 million Coca-Cola fans is roughly equivalent to the average viewership of American Idol, one of television's most popular programs. And our Facebook fan page is growing each and every week, with over 75% of our current fan base under the age of 25. This is another great example of how we are successfully engaging and building brand love with a whole new generation of consumers.
As we further build our business momentum across the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we announced that we are expanding our collaboration with International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world's largest humanitarian agency. Together, with our global bottling partners, we worked with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in more than 50 countries. This partnership has helped provide disaster relief immediately after earthquakes in Haiti, Italy, China and Pakistan, droughts in Kenya, and more recently, flooding in Australia. We're proud to partner with this great organization to extend its worldwide reach. I'd like to invite all of you to visit our website to learn more about these and many other initiatives and programs we have in place to advance our sustainability goals and efforts.
2011 marks the 125th anniversary of Coca-Cola, a refreshing and affordable luxury available to consumers everywhere for just cents at a time. However, Coca-Cola's 125 journey is actually testament to our youth, not our age. There's something special about our enterprise that is in a state of constant renewal and dynamic growth. As we begin the second year of our 2020 Vision, we do so from a position of real strength and real momentum.  
We see opportunities ahead as exciting as those our predecessors must have seen 125 years ago, and we intend to capitalize on these opportunities by: first, investing further in our marketing, sales and infrastructure capabilities; secondly, by advancing our sustainability efforts to drive our business and extend our social license to operate everywhere; third, by embedding ourselves even further into our customers' growth strategies; and last but not least, by continuing to innovate across every aspect of our global enterprise.
Whether you've been a part of our journey for most of our 125-year history or a more recent investor, we sincerely thank you for your trust and confidence in our business. And as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain relevantly focused on advancing our global momentum to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for you and all of our share owners.
So with that, let me just turn the call over to Gary. Thank you."
26642,117038676,100920,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our volume and profit results were in line with or",2352,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Our volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming that our global leadership teams across our system are executing the right strategic plans to achieve our 2020 Vision. Today, we will discuss our comparable currency neutral results for the fourth quarter and the full year. This is consistent with how we've historically communicated our results, as in our opinion, this provides a more complete picture of our underlying business performance. 
That said, before going into the details of our financial highlights, we acknowledge that this quarter's comparable currency neutral results include significant structural changes principally related to our recent CCE transaction. For this reason, we're also providing the net impact of these structural changes to help you better understand our results and our performance in relation to our long-term growth targets.
To be clear, when we refer to the impact of structural items, these include: the acquisition of CCE's North American operations, new cross-licensed brands, principally Dr. Pepper, the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottlers, the elimination of CCE equity income and some other smaller structural items.
So let's start with our earnings results. As outlined in our release this morning, we reported comparable earnings per share for the quarter of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year. As we shared during our December 2010 modeling call, excluding the impact of one-time items, we anticipated that our recent transaction with CCE would be slightly dilutive to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. Today, we confirm that our transaction with CCE was in fact diluted by $0.02 per share to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. 
For the quarter, our comparable currency neutral net revenues were up 45%, driven by strong 6% increase in concentrate sales, 2% positive price mix and a 37% benefit from structural items. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 14%. This growth was composed of a 5% increase in concentrate sales in line with unit case sales, 1% positive price mix and an 8% benefit from structural items. This 1% full year price mix result came in just slightly ahead of our full year outlook, sustaining a year-long trend of sequential improvement. This reflects the recent strength of our developed markets, which helped offset the impact of expected and ongoing geographic mix, given growth in our emerging and developing markets. 
As for 2011, it would be reasonable to expect positive price mix results consistent with that as implied by our long-term growth targets.
We delivered consistent gross profit growth with our comparable currency neutral gross profit increasing 36% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, including a structural benefit of 28% in the quarter and 7% in the full year. It's important to note that all five of our geographic operating groups have positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth for the full year. As for our comparable currency neutral operating income, this grew 10% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. This benefit from structural items was 3% in the quarter and 1% in the full year.
Currency had a 1% positive impact on operating income in the quarter and 3% positive impact in the full year, which results in comparable operating income growth of 11% for the quarter and 14% for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 60% in the quarter, primarily driven by 52% increase related to structural changes. Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 15% for the full year, reflecting a 12% increase related to structural changes, bringing our full year cost of goods result in line with outlook we provided in our last earnings call.
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased 52% for the quarter, including a 45% impact related to structural items. These results were in line with our expectations and primarily driven by continued investment in our bottling operations, the timing of marketing expenses versus the prior year and higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs.
For the full year, comparable currency neutral SG&A were up 16%, including a 12% impact related to structural items. With regards to operating expense leverage, please remember that we're referring to the point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth of a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items.
For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating expense leverage was in line with our expectations down three points, which includes an adverse six-point impact due to the impact of the structural items. Our healthy operating results across each and every one of our operating groups helped drive our cash flow from operations, up 16% to $9.5 billion. 
For the full year 2010, we repurchased $3.1 billion in company stock, which is more than the $2 billion we indicated in our last earnings call. Given the performance of our stock in 2010, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs at year end, therefore, we ramped up our repurchases in response to that stock option activity. While many of you rightly decreased our year end share count in your models due to our previously announced share repurchase plans, this greater stock option program activity resulted in our share count, actually remaining almost constant at year end. This higher year end share count versus your modeled expectations equates to an earnings per share impact of between $0.01 and $0.02. 
As for 2011, we expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year, and we'll update you on our progress during future quarterly earnings calls. 
Now let me take a minute to follow-up on some of the items we called out during our December 2010 Modeling Conference Call. First, we referenced that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we would benefit from an estimated $5 billion, one-time, noncash gain related to the revaluing of our CCE shares at the closing date fair value. We can now confirm today that this benefit did indeed result in a one-time gain of approximately $5 billion. I'll remind you that this one-time gain does not impact comparable earnings results. 
In our December 2010 call, we also mentioned that we would incur a transaction-related gross profit in inventory and fair value adjustment to our cost of goods in the fourth quarter based on our inventory levels at year end. And I can confirm that this adjustment impacted our fourth quarter results by $235 million. 
Now let me provide some further updates on a few factors we see impacting our 2011 results. First, we expect to see some different phasing of revenue and gross profit capture in upcoming quarters. As we explained in our December call, prior to the transaction with CCE, revenue and profit related to the sale of our products was recognized when our concentrate shipped to CCE, which we reported as concentrate sales, or in the case of our finished goods product at the time, we shipped the finished goods to CCE. Now that we own the manufacturing and distribution assets to produce and sell these products, the revenue tied to their sale and therefore, their associated concentrate profit, is not recognized until they're sold as physical cases. For example, last year, most of our pre-Easter holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our first quarter 2010 results. This year, most of our Easter holiday-related finished goods sales will likely follow in the second quarter 2011 results.  And last year, most of our pre-July 4 holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our second quarter 2010 results. This year, much of our July 4 holiday related finished goods sales will likely fall in the third quarter of 2011 results. 
With regard to commodities, our recent acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in an adjustment to our company's overall cost structure, especially in North America. Today, approximately 35% of our total company's cost of goods is made up of both the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following four inputs: sweeteners, metals, juices and PET. As you would expect, the bulk of these cost reside within our North American and Bottling Investment Group businesses. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue facing pressure and volatility in today's marketplace. As a result, we expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity cost on our total company results to range between $300 billion and $400 billion. 
As per our comments during our December call, prior to the close of our transaction with CCE, we were precluded from hedging the exposures associated with these commodities. We are now actively hedging many of these commodity exposures, much like we traditionally have done with global currencies where we have a history of prudently managing exposure. In addition, it's important to note that many of our derivatives related to these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP requirements, and therefore, we are required to recognize the unrealized change in fair value of the derivatives in our results. As such, our reported results now reflect any associated unrealized gains or losses related to these hedging activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the unrealized gain related to our hedging activities for CCR commodity exposures that did not qualify for hedge accounting was $29 million. We have excluded this gain from our comparable fourth quarter 2010 earnings, even though including it would've improved our fourth quarter comparable earnings as we felt this was the right thing to do in order to provide you with a better understanding of our operating results. 
We've called out this $29 million gain in our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules and we'll reflect these gains in future comparable earnings in the same period that we realize a corresponding change in value of the underlying exposure.
A related question some of you have asked with regards to the recent rise in commodity prices is the corresponding impact this may have on our 2011 pricing strategies. I can assure you that our long term pricing strategy remains unchanged. Simply said, our goal is to always provide consumers with the right product at the right time, in the right package and at the right price. In this way, we will keep driving sustainable volume and value growth in every market and category in which we compete. 
Now let me provide an initial outlook on currencies, including the impact from our hedged positions and the cycling of our prior year rates. We expect currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year and in the first quarter of 2011. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A expenses in 2011. Further, we reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of cost synergies related to our CCE transaction this year. 
Further, we remain well on plan and on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of this year. And while we continue to cycle the benefits of these ongoing productivity initiatives, we expect to capture positive operating expense leverage in 2011, consistent with what is implied by our long-term growth targets. 
From a capital expenditure standpoint, and as I discussed during our December call, our annual capital expenditure needs will increase in 2011 as we incorporate CCE's former North American operations. As I also mentioned during our December 2010 call, we plan to make additional investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness, the net results of these North American specific expenditures will be an increase of approximately $1 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program.
In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments Group. As a result, we expect our 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion.
Finally with regard to our tax rate, please note that the variances between our reported and underlying tax rates for both the fourth quarter and the full year was due to the impact of various items affecting comparability. The most significant of which was the $5 billion one-time, noncash gain related to the CCE transaction that I discussed earlier. Looking ahead to 2011, our current best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will range between $23.5% and 24.5 %. 
Before I close my prepared remarks this morning, some of you have asked us to provide additional commentary regarding our long-term growth targets. First of all, we have always viewed these targets as multiyear or long-term targets. We run our business with an aim toward achieving the highest returns for our share owners over time. This philosophy has served us well in the past, and we believe is the right way to run a sustainable, productive and dynamic business. This however, does not mean that we do not closely monitor our quarterly results. As we manage our business quarter-to-quarter, our focus is much more on understanding and identifying short-term macroeconomic trends that may call for us to adjust our short-term tactics as we execute our long-term strategies. And while we often compare our annual performance results alongside our long-term growth targets, our most important consideration is ensuring that every year, we make the right long-term decisions to attain our goals, to achieve our 2020 Vision and beyond. 
In closing, our strong 2010 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our company's long-term comparable currency neutral growth rate, which are and have been 3% to 4% volume growth, 5% to 6% revenue growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and a high-single digits earnings per share growth.

I think what you need to sort of look at is what is driving that growth? And I think what's driving that growth is really, in still a somewhat mixed economy around the world, challenging economy around the world is the alignment that we're executing with our bottlers, the alignment that we have to strengthen alignment, the investments that we've been making in our brands in our infrastructure over the past, not just the year but multiple years, the strength of the brands, the strength of the geographic portfolio, all of that is coming to the four, I think, in terms of what you're seeing. Now again, in terms of the world economy, Gary mentioned commodities. There's currency, also in terms of the challenge, inflation coming out of commodities, political issues, uncertainties in some parts of the world as we've seen recently, the incredible amount of cash just sitting on the sidelines, about $2 trillion just in the United States, generally still some lack of confidence. But at the same time, as I mentioned, in 2009, we saw a tremendously difficult environment in some parts like Russia, Eastern Europe. We see some signs of improvement in certain parts of the world, better than they've been in the past and many emerging markets continue to grow. And consumer confidence is good in many of the emerging markets. So I think as we execute our long-term strategy, as we build on our momentum, our strategy is working, and that's what you're seeing coming out with a 5% organic growth in our business for the full year. And again, north of $1 billion unit cases added to our business, which we feel good about in terms of what has been achieved in 2010. But we remain resolutely focused on our execution and continue to drive results with our bottling partners."

So can you talk about your outlook for bottle/can pricing? How that's changed since you've taken over the CCE North American operations? And then Gary, just a little more color on the CapEx piece, your run rate on CapEx for 2011 will actually be sort of greater than your incoming trend plus all of CCE's CapEx. So can you highlight how much of that increase would you say is sort of CCE-related, and how much of that is sort of these additional opportunities that you mentioned?"

We will have positive pricing in North America in 2011 as well. What we're trying to say is that basically, our pricing will be rational but it will also be pricing that's rational, not only in terms of competitors in the competitive marketplace, but also rational pricing in terms of the consumer. And there, we would much rather -- in rational, I mean, take -- let's say not react totally to, I hope, short term volatility in commodities, but take more consistent rational pricing over a period of time over a number of years, which we believe is the right thing for our customers, it's the right thing for our consumers and in fact, will return much greater value to us and actually to the beverage industry over a longer period of time. So we're being very rational about it, we will take that price, and we are increasing pricing in 2011 in North America. So I can confirm that directly. Relative to CapEx, the increase from -- in fact the CapEx, if you look at it, was about $2.2 billion in 2010. And we're talking about going to $3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2011. CCE North America, Legacy CCE North America was around $600 million, $650 million. There's a large piece of that increase then from, let's say, from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $3.2 billion. A large part of that, more than half of it actually is incremental CapEx that is related to the integration efforts of CCE North American sales. It is -- a lot of it's IT of having rationalizing the various systems to get us all within North America on the same system. Those types of things -- so in fact, what I would expect you will see is over the next couple of years, those investments actually will peak over about two years or they'll start going back down. Then we do have some real opportunities to increase both production and sales execution in a lot of our work. BIG markets, which are growing rapidly as Muhtar talked about in his section. So we're continuing to increase there, as I say, both in production capacity as well as sales execution capability, cold drink equipment, et cetera in those markets to continue to invest in the long term. And then back to the question asked earlier by Carlos, over some period of time a lot of those bottlers will actually be refranchised. And you'd see CapEx go down again relative to that."

I'm pleased to report that once again, the Coca-Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success. 
In 2010, we met or exceeded all of our long-term growth targets. And we achieved these results against a backdrop of an unbalanced global economic recovery and while completing our acquisition of CCE's North America business. 
At the same time, we once more gained volume and value share in Global non-alcoholic beverages. We also gained global volume in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. Together, with our global bottling partners, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision and are advancing our momentum.
Our brands are stronger and healthier, fueled dynamically by our marketing and innovation. Brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year, the highest full year growth our wonderful flagship brand has achieved in over a decade. Our investments are rising as we keenly focused on expanding our profitable operations in a sustainable way across more than 200 markets where we do business today. 
Our business in North America is growing again. We delivered positive organic volume growth for the full year in North America. This complements the rapid and successful work we're doing to integrate our North America business, all designed to bring greater growth, profitability and value to our flagship market. And today, our system is more aligned than it has been in a decade. In 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision, we executed and performed as one closely coordinated global system. No question, the journey to our 2020 Vision is underway.
Turning now to our performance results. I'm happy to report that our volume growth grew a strong 6% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America, our quarterly volume growth was a strong 5%. This was fueled by organic volume growth in every one of our five geographic operating groups. 
As for the full year, we also grew our global volume 5%, again ahead of our long-term growth target and delivered over $1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth. That is more than the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business.
We increased fourth quarter net revenues 45% on a comparable currency neutral basis. For the full year, we grew comparable currency neutral net revenues 14% in line with our long-term growth target, even after excluding the benefit of structural changes, principally due to the CCE transaction and the benefit of new cross-licensed brand. 
This quarter, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year and at the high end of our long-term growth target. On a full year basis, we delivered comparable earnings per share growth of 14%, well ahead of our long-term growth target.
And our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 10%. This brings our full year comparable currency neutral operating income to 11%, also above our long-term growth target. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive year we have either met or exceeded our long-term profit growth target.
These strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance results further strengthened the foundation of our business and provide us with great momentum as we embark on 2011, the second year of our journey to 2020.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 8% this quarter, with organic volume growth of 3%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This was North America's third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a full year basis, our North America volume was up 2% and organic volume was up 1%, excluding again the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. 
The same time, this past quarter, we completed the acquisition of CCE's North America business on plan and on schedule. Today, we're very pleased to report that our new operating structure and our leadership teams are well in place, and that our integration efforts are proceeding exactly as planned.
Sparkling beverages in North America, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, were up 1% in the quarter and even for the full year. Including the benefit of our cross-licensed brands, North America sparkling beverages were up 8% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Importantly, North America grew sparkling volume and value share for the quarter and full year versus the total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. Trademark Coca-Cola in North America was up 1% in the quarter, led by Coke Zero, which delivered double-digit volume growth for the 19th consecutive quarter. Sprite had a third consecutive quarter of positive growth up 4% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fanta also delivered positive growth for the quarter and the full year.
We also extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers. This game-changing innovation is now available in more than 400 locations across 20 U.S. markets, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. Plans for further expansion in 2011 are well on track with availability expected to reach more than 80 U.S. markets by the end of 2011.  All of these developments reaffirm the fact that our system is executing the right strategies to sustainably drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report a strong 7% increase for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 12 of the past 14 quarters and value share for 13 of the last 14 quarters. Our North America Juices and Juice Drink business delivered positive full year growth of 2%. This was fueled by our Simply brand up double-digits for the full year. 
In the North America Tea category, we saw 11% growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year, led by Gold Peak, which more than doubled its volume in 2010. Our glac√©au brands grew 19% in the quarter, and our vitaminwater trademark growth up double digits was led by the further expansion of vitaminwater zero. In addition, smartwater delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth.
POWERade was up a solid 20% in the quarter, outperforming the North America's sports drinks category and gaining share versus our primary competitor for the ninth consecutive quarter. For the full year, POWERade delivered strong 19% growth, including over 60% full year growth for POWERade Zero, our innovative zero calories sports drink.
These strong results in North America are a testament to our long-held belief that through strong marketing and focused execution, we can accelerate our leadership position within North America and drive profitable and sustainable growth in our flagship market.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa. This operating group saw broad-based growth, up 14% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Once again, all nine business units in this operating group delivered positive volume growth. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola was up 12% for the quarter and up 10% for the full year, benefiting from our strategic investments across the entire region. This strong performance in Eurasia and Africa was led by Russia, up 31% this quarter and finishing the full year up 16%. We once again outperformed the market in Russia this quarter, led by the continued strong performance of our core sparkling brands. Brand Coca-Cola in Russia was up 37%, for the quarter and up 26% for the full year. This performance represents the largest ever single-year incremental volume growth for brand Coca-Cola in Russia.  It is no surprise therefore that Coca-Cola was recently awarded the Best Soft Drink of the Year at Russia's Brand of the Year Award ceremony. As such, we believe we are ideally positioned to outperform our primary international competitor in Russia. 
India, meanwhile, returned to double-digit growth, up 12% in the fourth quarter and 17% on a full year basis. This market has now achieved double-digit growth in nine of the last quarters. And India captured share growth across our sparkling and still portfolio in both the quarter and on a full year basis. This shows, demonstrates that India is delivering high-quality growth consistently across our entire portfolio rather than relying on select growth from any single category.
Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, both up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. In fact, our brands now represents four of the top five sparkling brands in India. And our still beverage growth in India benefited from the further expansion of our Maaza juice brand, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year.
We also grew double digits in both the quarter and the full year in Turkey, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. As for performance in Africa, South Africa delivered 8% unit case volume growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, building on our momentum coming out of last summer's FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing in-market investments. We also saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and high single-digit growth in North and West Africa, providing a very strong and consistent finish to our full year performance throughout the African continent.
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 1% in the fourth quarter, cycling 11% from the previous year, bringing our full year volume growth to 6%. These results were driven by a second consecutive quarter of positive growth for Japan, which was up 2% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This growth in Japan was widespread across our beverage portfolio. Leading the way was Coca-Cola trademark, up 5% in Japan this quarter, a fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. On a full year basis, Coca-Cola trademark was also up 5%, making this the fourth consecutive year Coca-Cola trademark has grown 3% or more in Japan.  We are encouraged by the recent momentum in this highly profitable developed market. But having said that, we remain cautious about the current and ongoing economic challenges in Japan.
Turning to China. Our full year volume grew 6%, with fourth quarter volume down 3%. You will recall this quarter that we are cycling 29% volume growth from the prior year. As we indicated in our first quarter 2010 earnings call, it is not uncommon to see quarter-to-quarter volume swings in China. This is especially true between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of every year, given that fluctuating end of year trading activity, driven by the very timing of Chinese New Year. That said, our Sparkling Beverages and Juice and Juice Drinks captured volume and value share in China in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, 2010, we grew our business in China by over $100 million incremental unit cases, our seventh consecutive year of achieving this level of incremental unit case growth. And cumulatively over the last two years, we've expanded our volume in China by 24%, significantly widening the gap with our primary international competitor. Over the same two-year time period, our compounded annual growth rate in China was 11%, in line with our long term double-digit growth objectives for China.
This last quarter of 2010 marked a significant milestone for our business in China as Minute Maid Pulpy, a brand born and launched in China achieved $1 billion brand status in only five years. Minute Maid Pulpy is now our company's 14th billion-dollar brand. The rapid scalability of the Pulpy brand across 18 other markets is actually a testament to our systems' ability to rapidly adopt and scale brand innovation from any part of the world.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are adapting our in-market strategies to make sure that we keep building on our strong foundation and remain well positioned to win in China between now and 2020. As more remote areas of China experience accelerated economic growth, we are investing heavily to expand the scale of our distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, we opened three new plants to further enhance our ability to serve China's growing consumer and customer base.
As the retail trade in the coastal regions further evolves from traditional local outlets to newer and larger channels, we're also investing heavily to grow in the hyper and supermarket channels. And as the Chinese consumer demands increasingly varied and sophisticated offerings, we are innovating and introducing a wider variety of packaged choices that will drive increased transactions and build brand equity.  
Our team in China is executing all of these strategic actions to build greater brands across categories to drive strong and sustainable growth in this important market. As we've said before, the real measure of our success in China will be how we continue to seize growth opportunities in that region between now and 2020. While we may see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we're confident that we have the right strategy, the right execution plans and the right capabilities in place today, and are better positioned than our competitors to deliver long-term sustainable double-digit growth in China.
Our positive full year results in Japan and China were further complemented by our performance across the region. For example, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea and Vietnam each grew double digits for the full year. These four specific countries combined grew well over $100 million incremental unit cases in 2010. This demonstrates the strength and value of our Pacific Group's broad geographic portfolio.
In addition, Brazil, Russia, India and China, commonly referred to as the BRIC nations, grew 10% as a whole for the full year. It is worth noting that these four BRIC countries represented over $400 million cases of incremental growth in 2010 or almost 40% of our company's total incremental volume growth for the year.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a steady 5% for both the quarter and the full year. We also gained volume and value share in the total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling and still beverages. This broad-based growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Brazil delivered strong results, with volume up 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. 
Mexico volume was up 8% for the quarter and 3% for the full year as weather conditions normalized from the previous quarter. Mexico has now gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share from 15 of the last 16 quarters and value share for 16 consecutive quarters. Our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered mid-single digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, rounding out another solid and consistent year for our Latin America operating group.
Moving to Europe, we saw positive growth in the quarter despite ongoing economic challenges. Volume was up 2% for the quarter and even for the full year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by trademark Coca-Cola up 2% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Our still beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with tea up 9% and energy drinks up double digits. 
France was up mid-single digits for both the quarter and the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of positive growth in this key developed market. Additionally, trademark Coca-Cola was up 5% for the full year. Great Britain delivered low single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, supported by growth across both our sparkling and still beverage portfolios. 
And while economic challenges remain across many parts of Europe, we're starting to see initial signs of recovery. In fact, several Central European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saw double-digit growth in the quarter, and others such as Romania, Switzerland, Austria, grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. And Germany closed the year up 1% its first full year of positive volume growth since 2007. Importantly, we gained volume and value share in Germany to both the quarter and the full year.
Now let's turn to an overview of our brands and their performance. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across each and every one of the 206 countries around the globe. As a result for the total company, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter, excluding the benefit of new cross-licensed brands, with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. 
Coca-Cola Zero continues to be one of our fastest growing global sparkling beverages. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success in North America. In fact, this momentum extends around the world with Coca-Cola Zero up 9% for the quarter and up 7% for the full year across our international markets. And in 2010, Fanta grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year and became our company's third brand to surpass $2 billion annual unit case sales, along with Coca-Cola and Sprite.
We're also successfully expanding our global still beverage portfolio. Total worldwide still beverage unit case volume increased 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year, led by the further expansion of our global Juice and Juice Drinks and Sports Drinks businesses. In 2010, we grew our overall Juice and Juice Drink business by double digits in the quarter and 9% for the full year. These results build on a very successful decade for our global Juice and Juice Drink business, which delivered a compounded annual growth rate of greater than 9% over the past decade. 
Our global Sports Drink business registered a very strong result in 2010, up 14% for the full year. These results, driven by our global FIFA World Cup programs, were balanced across key geographies, including North America, Japan, Spain and Mexico.
We also saw ongoing success with the global expansion of vitaminwater with international sales nearly doubling in 2010. vitaminwater is now present in 20 international markets, with plans to launch into four new markets in the first quarter of 2011.  This great momentum in our brand portfolio is further supported by a balanced customer-growth plans and our disciplined execution culture. For example, our full year results with our top 10 global retail customers saw high single-digit volume and revenue growth. 
Our sales of immediate-consumption beverages grew 4% for the full year, driven by our focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2010 with more than 1/3 of these placed in China, India and Brazil.
We're also focused on expanding our right execution daily for Red program. Red is our world class commercial process designed to improve execution at the output level. Our internal pilot studies show that bottlers implementing Red saw an average volume growth of more than 10% over the life of the pilot period. Today, operations representing nearly a quarter of our global volume utilize Red. And going forward, this program will be an area of increasing emphasis and growth for our system.
Our results across operations and with our customers around the world point to a well-aligned and focused global Coca-Cola system, vigorously and passionately executing a common set of strategies and delivering on our 2020 Vision. 
One of the ways we established such a strong foundation in 2010 was through the innovative and world-class methods: We engage and connect with our consumers each and every single day. Last December for example, we accomplished our most ambitious social media project ever named Expedition 206. Over 365 days, three Coca-Cola Happiness Ambassadors, traveled more than 275,000 miles and visited 186 countries on a mission to seek out and document sources of happiness around the world. Our Happiness Ambassadors brought their adventure to life for fans and followers in real time across social networking sites, bringing millions of people together in a way that only a brand with Coca-Cola's global reach could hope to accomplish. One of the sites in which the story came to life was our Coca-Cola Facebook fan page, where we currently have over 22 million fans, making us the most popular consumer brand page on Facebook.
And to put this in perspective, 22 million Coca-Cola fans is roughly equivalent to the average viewership of American Idol, one of television's most popular programs. And our Facebook fan page is growing each and every week, with over 75% of our current fan base under the age of 25. This is another great example of how we are successfully engaging and building brand love with a whole new generation of consumers.
As we further build our business momentum across the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we announced that we are expanding our collaboration with International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world's largest humanitarian agency. Together, with our global bottling partners, we worked with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in more than 50 countries. This partnership has helped provide disaster relief immediately after earthquakes in Haiti, Italy, China and Pakistan, droughts in Kenya, and more recently, flooding in Australia. We're proud to partner with this great organization to extend its worldwide reach. I'd like to invite all of you to visit our website to learn more about these and many other initiatives and programs we have in place to advance our sustainability goals and efforts.
2011 marks the 125th anniversary of Coca-Cola, a refreshing and affordable luxury available to consumers everywhere for just cents at a time. However, Coca-Cola's 125 journey is actually testament to our youth, not our age. There's something special about our enterprise that is in a state of constant renewal and dynamic growth. As we begin the second year of our 2020 Vision, we do so from a position of real strength and real momentum.  
We see opportunities ahead as exciting as those our predecessors must have seen 125 years ago, and we intend to capitalize on these opportunities by: first, investing further in our marketing, sales and infrastructure capabilities; secondly, by advancing our sustainability efforts to drive our business and extend our social license to operate everywhere; third, by embedding ourselves even further into our customers' growth strategies; and last but not least, by continuing to innovate across every aspect of our global enterprise.
Whether you've been a part of our journey for most of our 125-year history or a more recent investor, we sincerely thank you for your trust and confidence in our business. And as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain relevantly focused on advancing our global momentum to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for you and all of our share owners.
So with that, let me just turn the call over to Gary. Thank you."

To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our volume and profit results were in line with or",2351,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Our volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming that our global leadership teams across our system are executing the right strategic plans to achieve our 2020 Vision. Today, we will discuss our comparable currency neutral results for the fourth quarter and the full year. This is consistent with how we've historically communicated our results, as in our opinion, this provides a more complete picture of our underlying business performance. 
That said, before going into the details of our financial highlights, we acknowledge that this quarter's comparable currency neutral results include significant structural changes principally related to our recent CCE transaction. For this reason, we're also providing the net impact of these structural changes to help you better understand our results and our performance in relation to our long-term growth targets.
To be clear, when we refer to the impact of structural items, these include: the acquisition of CCE's North American operations, new cross-licensed brands, principally Dr. Pepper, the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottlers, the elimination of CCE equity income and some other smaller structural items.
So let's start with our earnings results. As outlined in our release this morning, we reported comparable earnings per share for the quarter of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year. As we shared during our December 2010 modeling call, excluding the impact of one-time items, we anticipated that our recent transaction with CCE would be slightly dilutive to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. Today, we confirm that our transaction with CCE was in fact diluted by $0.02 per share to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. 
For the quarter, our comparable currency neutral net revenues were up 45%, driven by strong 6% increase in concentrate sales, 2% positive price mix and a 37% benefit from structural items. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 14%. This growth was composed of a 5% increase in concentrate sales in line with unit case sales, 1% positive price mix and an 8% benefit from structural items. This 1% full year price mix result came in just slightly ahead of our full year outlook, sustaining a year-long trend of sequential improvement. This reflects the recent strength of our developed markets, which helped offset the impact of expected and ongoing geographic mix, given growth in our emerging and developing markets. 
As for 2011, it would be reasonable to expect positive price mix results consistent with that as implied by our long-term growth targets.
We delivered consistent gross profit growth with our comparable currency neutral gross profit increasing 36% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, including a structural benefit of 28% in the quarter and 7% in the full year. It's important to note that all five of our geographic operating groups have positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth for the full year. As for our comparable currency neutral operating income, this grew 10% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. This benefit from structural items was 3% in the quarter and 1% in the full year.
Currency had a 1% positive impact on operating income in the quarter and 3% positive impact in the full year, which results in comparable operating income growth of 11% for the quarter and 14% for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 60% in the quarter, primarily driven by 52% increase related to structural changes. Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 15% for the full year, reflecting a 12% increase related to structural changes, bringing our full year cost of goods result in line with outlook we provided in our last earnings call.
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased 52% for the quarter, including a 45% impact related to structural items. These results were in line with our expectations and primarily driven by continued investment in our bottling operations, the timing of marketing expenses versus the prior year and higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs.
For the full year, comparable currency neutral SG&A were up 16%, including a 12% impact related to structural items. With regards to operating expense leverage, please remember that we're referring to the point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth of a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items.
For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating expense leverage was in line with our expectations down three points, which includes an adverse six-point impact due to the impact of the structural items. Our healthy operating results across each and every one of our operating groups helped drive our cash flow from operations, up 16% to $9.5 billion. 
For the full year 2010, we repurchased $3.1 billion in company stock, which is more than the $2 billion we indicated in our last earnings call. Given the performance of our stock in 2010, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs at yearend; therefore, we ramped up our repurchases in response to that stock option activity. While many of you rightly decreased our year end share count in your models due to our previously announced share repurchase plans, this greater stock option program activity resulted in our share count, actually remaining almost constant at year end. This higher year end share count versus your modeled expectations equates to an earnings per share impact of between $0.01 and $0.02. 
As for 2011, we expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year, and we'll update you on our progress during future quarterly earnings calls. 
Now let me take a minute to follow-up on some of the items we called out during our December 2010 Modeling Conference Call. First, we referenced that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we would benefit from an estimated $5 billion, one-time, noncash gain related to the revaluing of our CCE shares at the closing date fair value. We can now confirm today that this benefit did indeed result in a one-time gain of approximately $5 billion. I'll remind you that this one-time gain does not impact comparable earnings results. 
In our December 2010 call, we also mentioned that we would incur a transaction-related gross profit in inventory and fair value adjustment to our cost of goods in the fourth quarter based on our inventory levels at year end. And I can confirm that this adjustment impacted our fourth quarter results by $235 million. 
Now let me provide some further updates on a few factors we see impacting our 2011 results. First, we expect to see some different phasing of revenue and gross profit capture in upcoming quarters. As we explained in our December call, prior to the transaction with CCE, revenue and profit related to the sale of our products was recognized when our concentrate shipped to CCE, which we reported as concentrate sales, or in the case of our finished goods product at the time, we shipped the finished goods to CCE. Now that we own the manufacturing and distribution assets to produce and sell these products, the revenue tied to their sale and therefore, their associated concentrate profit, is not recognized until they're sold as physical cases. For example, last year, most of our pre-Easter holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our first quarter 2010 results. This year, most of our Easter holiday-related finished goods sales will likely follow in the second quarter 2011 results.  And last year, most of our pre-July 4 holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our second quarter 2010 results. This year, much of our July 4 holiday related finished goods sales will likely fall in the third quarter of 2011 results. 
With regard to commodities, our recent acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in an adjustment to our company's overall cost structure, especially in North America. Today, approximately 35% of our total company's cost of goods is made up of both the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following four inputs: sweeteners, metals, juices and PET. As you would expect, the bulk of these cost reside within our North American and Bottling Investment Group businesses. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue facing pressure and volatility in today's marketplace. As a result, we expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity cost on our total company results to range between $300 billion and $400 billion. 
As per our comments during our December call, prior to the close of our transaction with CCE, we were precluded from hedging the exposures associated with these commodities. We are now actively hedging many of these commodity exposures, much like we traditionally have done with global currencies where we have a history of prudently managing exposure. In addition, it's important to note that many of our derivatives related to these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP requirements, and therefore, we are required to recognize the unrealized change in fair value of the derivatives in our results. As such, our reported results now reflect any associated unrealized gains or losses related to these hedging activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the unrealized gain related to our hedging activities for CCR commodity exposures that did not qualify for hedge accounting was $29 million. We have excluded this gain from our comparable fourth quarter 2010 earnings, even though including it would've improved our fourth quarter comparable earnings as we felt this was the right thing to do in order to provide you with a better understanding of our operating results. 
We've called out this $29 million gain in our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules and we'll reflect these gains in future comparable earnings in the same period that we realize a corresponding change in value of the underlying exposure.
A related question some of you have asked with regards to the recent rise in commodity prices is the corresponding impact this may have on our 2011 pricing strategies. I can assure you that our long term pricing strategy remains unchanged. Simply said, our goal is to always provide consumers with the right product at the right time, in the right package and at the right price. In this way, we will keep driving sustainable volume and value growth in every market and category in which we compete. 
Now let me provide an initial outlook on currencies, including the impact from our hedged positions and the cycling of our prior year rates. We expect currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year and in the first quarter of 2011. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A expenses in 2011. Further, we reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of cost synergies related to our CCE transaction this year. 
Further, we remain well on plan and on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of this year. And while we continue to cycle the benefits of these ongoing productivity initiatives, we expect to capture positive operating expense leverage in 2011, consistent with what is implied by our long-term growth targets. 
From a capital expenditure standpoint, and as I discussed during our December call, our annual capital expenditure needs will increase in 2011 as we incorporate CCE's former North American operations. As I also mentioned during our December 2010 call, we plan to make additional investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness, the net results of these North American specific expenditures will be an increase of approximately $1 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program.
In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments Group. As a result, we expect our 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion.
Finally with regard to our tax rate, please note that the variances between our reported and underlying tax rates for both the fourth quarter and the full year was due to the impact of various items affecting comparability. The most significant of which was the $5 billion one-time, noncash gain related to the CCE transaction that I discussed earlier. Looking ahead to 2011, our current best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will range between $23.5% and 24.5 %. 
Before I close my prepared remarks this morning, some of you have asked us to provide additional commentary regarding our long-term growth targets. First of all, we have always viewed these targets as multiyear or long-term targets. We run our business with an aim toward achieving the highest returns for our share owners over time. This philosophy has served us well in the past, and we believe is the right way to run a sustainable, productive and dynamic business. This however, does not mean that we do not closely monitor our quarterly results. As we manage our business quarter-to-quarter, our focus is much more on understanding and identifying short-term macroeconomic trends that may call for us to adjust our short-term tactics as we execute our long-term strategies. And while we often compare our annual performance results alongside our long-term growth targets, our most important consideration is ensuring that every year, we make the right long-term decisions to attain our goals, to achieve our 2020 Vision and beyond. 
In closing, our strong 2010 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our company's long-term comparable currency neutral growth rate, which are and have been 3% to 4% volume growth, 5% to 6% revenue growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and a high-single digits earnings per share growth.

I think what you need to sort of look at is what is driving that growth? And I think what's driving that growth is really, in still a somewhat mixed economy around the world, challenging economy around the world, is the alignment that we're executing with our bottlers, the alignment that we have to strengthen alignment, the investments that we've been making in our brands in our infrastructure over the past, not just the year but multiple years, the strength of the brands, the strength of the geographic portfolio, all of that is coming to the four, I think, in terms of what you're seeing. Now again, in terms of the world economy, Gary mentioned commodities. There's currency, also in terms of the challenge, inflation coming out of commodities, political issues, uncertainties in some parts of the world as we've seen recently, the incredible amount of cash just sitting on the sidelines, about $2 trillion just in the United States, generally still some lack of confidence. But at the same time, as I mentioned, in 2009, we saw a tremendously difficult environment in some parts like Russia, Eastern Europe. We see some signs of improvement in certain parts of the world, better than they've been in the past and many emerging markets continue to grow. And consumer confidence is good in many of the emerging markets. So I think as we execute our long-term strategy, as we build on our momentum, our strategy is working, and that's what you're seeing coming out with a 5% organic growth in our business for the full year. And again, north of $1 billion unit cases added to our business, which we feel good about in terms of what has been achieved in 2010. But we remain resolutely focused on our execution and continue to drive results with our bottling partners."

So can you talk about your outlook for bottle/can pricing? How that's changed since you've taken over the CCE North American operations? And then Gary, just a little more color on the CapEx piece, your run rate on CapEx for 2011 will actually be sort of greater than your incoming trend plus all of CCE's CapEx. So can you highlight how much of that increase would you say is sort of CCE-related, and how much of that is sort of these additional opportunities that you mentioned?"

We will have positive pricing in North America in 2011 as well. What we're trying to say is that basically, our pricing will be rational but it will also be pricing that's rational, not only in terms of competitors in the competitive marketplace, but also rational pricing in terms of the consumer. And there, we would much rather -- in rational, I mean, take -- let's say not react totally to, I hope, short term volatility in commodities, but take more consistent rational pricing over a period of time over a number of years, which we believe is the right thing for our customers, it's the right thing for our consumers and in fact, will return much greater value to us and actually to the beverage industry over a longer period of time. So we're being very rational about it, we will take that price, and we are increasing pricing in 2011 in North America. So I can confirm that directly. Relative to CapEx, the increase from -- in fact the CapEx, if you look at it, was about $2.2 billion in 2010. And we're talking about going to $3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2011. CCE North America, Legacy CCE North America was around $600 million, $650 million. There's a large piece of that increase then from, let's say, from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $3.2 billion. A large part of that, more than half of it actually is incremental CapEx that is related to the integration efforts of CCE North American sales. It is -- a lot of it's IT of having rationalizing the various systems to get us all within North America on the same system. Those types of things -- so in fact, what I would expect you will see is over the next couple of years, those investments actually will peak over about two years or they'll start going back down. Then we do have some real opportunities to increase both production and sales execution in a lot of our work. BIG markets, which are growing rapidly as Muhtar talked about in his section. So we're continuing to increase there, as I say, both in production capacity as well as sales execution capability, cold drink equipment, et cetera in those markets to continue to invest in the long term. And then back to the question asked earlier by Carlos, over some period of time a lot of those bottlers will actually be refranchised. And you'd see CapEx go down again relative to that."

So overall, we are pricing at a level that we think is the right thing to do long term, but we are not pricing at a level to say, ""Okay, I have to make up for all of this commodity pressure because commodities go up, commodities go down."" And I don't want you to then ask me the same question, ""Are you taking your pricing down because commodity prices went down?"" That's not what you do if, in fact, you're trying to continue to build a stronger and stronger brands over the long term, which is what we're into and not a quarter-by-quarter, ""Oh my God, what did commodities do this quarter?"""

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We're winning share in the marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic beverages as well is both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coca-Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth global brand to surpass the 110 billion retail sales value threshold. 
And we are winning with our global still beverage portfolio, as Del Valle, the brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision, together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthquake and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and the thank our leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time of crisis. I'd also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been diligently producing, distributing beverages to affected areas and restoring our business operations. 
Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first-hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given our nearly 60-year presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery and rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the ongoing relief efforts including donations of over $7 million bottles of product. Through our Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country.
As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the hardest-hit regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also announced plans to reduce our power usage in the Southern and East Japan mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of community, while ensuring our machine stay on and in support of small businesses which rely on the vending channel.
With regard to this quarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light of recent events, we are actively evaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and consumer needs. 
As this topic is top of mind mine for many of our shareowners, Gary will review later in our call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent events may have on our business in Japan.  And be assured of that in the coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this evolving operating environment.
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long-term growth target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we achieved these performance results despite natural disasters, political uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices.
As the global recovery and volatility continue, we may see some bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will continue to meet and exceed our long-term growth targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America flagship market. North America volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This marks a fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for North America. And importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in this quarter. 
In the United States trademark, Coca-Cola gained share while Diet Coke was named the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero once again delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respectively this past quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long-term growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North America juices and juice drink business delivered positive growth this quarter fueled once again by our Simply brand, which grew 20%. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value share in the U.S. 
Our glac√©au brands gained volume and value share this quarter, growing 12% with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this past quarter and once again outperforming the North America sports drink category. Our North America tea business extended its momentum, delivering 12% growth for the quarter. 
We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top-selling organic bottled tea company. We are excited to fully welcomed this great and innovative brand to our family. 
In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as planned. At the same time, we're leveraging on strong marketing and sales capabilities to accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double-digit growth in China was driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and sustained investment in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, with both also growing double digits. In fact, our sparkling beverage share in China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. 
Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our last earnings call, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand equity. In support of this strategy, we launched a new single-serve 300 ml package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter including 5% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Latin America's broad-based growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coca-Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico at this past quarter, continuing a trend we have consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years. 
Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unseasonably cold and wet weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single-digit growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% this past quarter led by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca-Cola grew 24% in Russia, posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Additionally, Sprite delivered strong double-digit growth in Russia and this past quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, contributing more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage growth in Russia this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarter and gained sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca-Cola, up a strong 19%. 
India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results, growing 9%. This now marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. India also once again delivered growth across our entire portfolio, with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter.
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive quarter of positive growth despite ongoing microeconomic challenges. We also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca-Cola also up 1%. And Coca-Cola Zero kept strong momentum in Europe increasing double digits once again. 
Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Germany delivered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share gains. 
Finally our business in Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Now let's turn to a few of the global brands' success stories, referenced at the start of today's call.  Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is also our fourth global brand to surpass the 10 billion retail sales value threshold, joining Coca-Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca-Cola. Building on this momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This highlights both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in investing behind our global brands. 
I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. When we partnered with Coca-Cola to jointly acquire the business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have expanded Del Valle to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries, making Del Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America region.
If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is the latest example of how our global system can be so nimble and flexible as well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle have all followed unique paths to the success. Simply represents a classic case study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our existing juice portfolio in order to take a juice and juice drink category leadership in the United States. Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed a unique brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leverage our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle stands as a prime demonstration of how we can partner with our system to quickly achieve scale and address an area of opportunity in our beverage portfolio all across Latin America.  The growth of these brands played a significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juice and juice drink. Yet we believe we have really just begun to tap our global potential in this key beverage category.
As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. I mentioned the work we're doing to support the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part of our company's DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on transforming lives and empowering communities across the African continent. We are involved in programs focused on improving access to clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training among others. Over the past decade, the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next decade, the foundation has committed to expanding its footprint and implementing a project in every country on the continent.
Another way we're building for a better tomorrow is by further advancing our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable plastic bottle but is made with plant-based materials, resulting in a lighter footprint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all the single-serve bottles in the United States would now be available in our PlantBottle. In fact, new packaging is entirely composed of material derived from sugarcane, making our company the first to develop and enter the market with 100% plant-based, fully recyclable package. 
And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United States. We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the environment.
As we build for a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. Diversity Business Magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison awards, including a Silver Award in the packaging category for our PlantBottle and a Gold award in the new retail use for our Freestyle fountain drink dispenser. 
While all of us at the Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is our good fortune to steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the backdrop of a global economy that is still rebalancing, so there is no question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. Yet this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. 
In fact, since day one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering the middle class in the next decade, the corresponding political economic and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of cities, personal mobility, technology and education. Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great challenges. Yet together with our bottling partners, we've been preparing for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength. The growing strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically advancing our global momentum. That is why as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that our system is well positioned to meet and exceed our long-term targets and to usher in a new era of winning to all of our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,127928847,117407,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We fee",2256,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. 
As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We feel particularly good about these results since we delivered them while productively integrating our North America business and while navigating several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment. 
While as expected, there are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that except for Japan, we did not see any of these puts and takes changing our full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this quarter's good results are a testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in keeping with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets. 
So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter.  As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year and in line with our long-term growth targets. While this result came in $0.01 below consensus and many analyst models, it includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of marketing expenses as we are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business to the Coca-Cola Company's accounting policies. 
Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in plain English. As many of you know, we apply something we call a sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we recognize marketing on a pennies per case basis, basically the same pennies per case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing across the year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize the costs over the full year in line with our estimated volume along with all the other marketing. 
Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing expenses associated with our newly acquired North American business. The application of that sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about this accounting adjustment until we finalized our quarterly business plan spreads, we roll out that many of you do not have this accounting reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going forward, please note that the sales curve dilution will reverse itself in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, our business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 dilutive effect on our first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging channel mix.
Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter, primarily related to bottler assistance and our $31 million Reconstruction Fund, a total approximately $80 million dollars. These are reflected in our GAAP, non-GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable results.
Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further influence our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, our Japan team is doing everything they can to restore our business in Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll be providing routine and updates regarding our business in Japan.
We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our updated currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies. Since our last earnings call in February, we are seeing a higher benefit and expect it from currency. Considering both our hedge positions and current spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that since our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is not a commodity that can be hedged, we are actively pursuing and executing plans to mitigate and also some of these increase, including the acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall commodity exposure.  In addition, we our strategically leveraging our brand pack channel and pricing strategies when appropriate to further balance this exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% starting in April.  As a result and based on our current best estimates, we expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts, as well as our improved currency benefits, to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million increase in 2011 commodity costs exposure over the course of this year. 
And please know that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Consistent with how we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net unrealized hedge gains in the notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedule and will continue to do so in our future earnings reports.
Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating income. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is operating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In addition, we now have single sales teams that sell of our products across customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands were sold prior to the Coca-Cola Enterprises North America transaction. 
Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a necessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results proportions of Coca-Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North America. This means that when reviewing our North America and total company results, there will be several financial statement line items and calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the past and will continue to look different through the balance of this year until we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you with comparable currency neutral results, consistent with how we've always communicated our results. Having said that, we recognize that some line items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to always provide you with as complete a picture of our underlying business performance as possible.
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to our recent CCE transaction. 
This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We understand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We therefore estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined international and Bottling Investment Group price mix was up 2% this quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this quarter, in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long-term growth targets.
Looking at a few other line items where these calculations this quarter were influenced by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To better understand this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated results in pieces. First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, resulting in unfavorable operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the year until we fully cycle that acquisition. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line with the guidance provided in our last call. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and considering the dilutive effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the full year. Similarly and not surprisingly, our gross margins for this quarter were also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction results as North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and our Bottling Investments Group saw positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth in the quarter, after excluding structural items.
Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans as part of our previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million, so pretty much all of it already contributed in the quarter. 
Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related to our 2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011.  With regard to our share repurchase program, we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at least 2 billion and 2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of the full year. 
As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in and thus will no longer recognize equity income from results.  Looking forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger between the Bottlers and El Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate that when you consider the sale of our ownership stake as well as the expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Canto merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately $0.01 on a full year basis.  Finally with respect to our tax rate, our underlying effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of between 23.5 and 24.5 provided in our last call. 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another quarter of solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We remain confident that we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands and driving long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

I think what you saw in the first quarter global -- huge global geopolitical challenges, natural disasters. And I'm very pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coke again grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in addition, Fanta, which is our fourth global brand passing the 10 billion retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding cross-licensed brands of 6% internationally. And if you look at -- it's important to look what we're cycling each quarter. We are consistently delivering volume growth in line with our long-term targets or above. And what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 5%, so we've actually increased the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 was 5% international. We're again accelerating that growth in the midst of huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us confidence as we go into the year. And again, when you look at our U.S. business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we're investing. As we do this, our brands are getting healthier. Our share results, market share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that shows by category, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a very long time. So again India and China, you've referenced, I think, China as we, Q1, sparkling gained volume share. Q1 still gained volume and value share. And sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years, and we're making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our bottlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come -- are all contributing to be part of the communities that they serve. And that India again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 2011 and maintained in the face of aggressive discounting from various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with brand Coke growing, Sprite growing, growing in a very healthy manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So overall, that gives me confidence. When I see our brands and last point in, China, Pulpy was up again almost 30%. And you asked about the Philippines, I think Philippines post-elections have been a very challenging environment after the heat -- the economy was heated artificially pre-elections, and what we're doing is making sure that our business stays healthy. We invest in our brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long term. And as far as Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So we're happy with the healthy performance also of BIG. Germany, as you can see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates to discounts or so. We are winning again in all channel in Germany now and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I frame your question, Carlos."

But there are couple of things we know we can quantify. If you put the impact, our best estimate is that the impact of Japan is $0.01. The impact of the sales curve on CCE North America is $0.01 and that would just reverse this Q1 in Q4. But if you just put those things together right there, that's 2 to 3 points on growth, just those 2 things. And then the hedges that we took, the commodity hedge gains, that's another $36 million, another $0.01. We took those out. Those will go back in kind of primarily third quarter-ish timing. But that's another 1.5 points of growth on OI. So that's why we feel comfortable. I mean, it's a dynamic world out there. But we feel comfortable with all the puts and takes, there's real bad things like the tragedy in Japan. There's some good things where we've made some decisions to change accounting policies, and it's a Q1, Q4 quarterly thing.

That's the second quarter in a row. prior to this, you'd need to note that transactions had declined every quarter dating back all the way to 2007. So that's something that again we're focusing on very heavily to continue to drive transaction. So I think in regards to transactions overall, we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that's somewhat compensate, also compensates also for the price of the increases that had been referenced as 1% to 2% and last call. What I'd like to also frame for the remainder of the year though, is that we will be looking at every opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like maybe 3% to 4%, as we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And at the same time, we will be diligently again doing, putting all our efforts to grow IC transactions in the United States and recognizing that  higher price increase may have some volume impact but driving transactions will be the key in North America. And I don't know if Gary would like to add to your other question that is related to the revenue realization given that the business is now operating as one integrated business. One other thing I'd like to add is again, the 16-ounce package was up double digits again in the quarter, which is giving us again goods metrics for the future."

Just a couple of things on North America and I want to focus on and reemphasize what Muhtar just said as well. When we look at it, we took different pricing percentages on different packages and different channels obviously as you would expect in North America. But the weighted average of all of that is in the 1% to 2% range. That's announced in the market and we're getting that. So we would have to kind of look at the scanner data that you're referring to because a lot of -- remember that Nielsen and only covers about, I think, about 40% of the U.S., our U.S. market, that there's so much that there's not in Nielsen and ROI. So that's the large part of it. But as Muhtar says, we're going to look at additional pricing this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to emphasize something else he was talking about, which was on driving on transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but then transactions is really about creating health for the brand, wealth for the brand and really drives sustainable long-term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us downsize packages in North America going to the 14- and 16-ounce and the reason to do that was to drive transaction and recruit and rerecruit users of our brands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind of price increase as well, where you downsize a package but hold the price and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets around the world as we talked about it. So all in all, I think you're seeing some actions that we're taking that we think will prove good long term for the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well."

Yes, you're right in saying, in looking at the fact that as far as commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system point of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase would you need. All we can signal if as obviously you mentioned -- you heard me talk about consumption. This is growing. That is a big benefit, when you have because those packages have a higher margin. They have a higher price and as the mix shifts in favor of immediate consumption, then obviously we get the benefit and a windfall and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me again in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in China. You see us doing the same thing in the Philippines, across the whole world, Germany many, many new packages. So I think we're employing a much more flexible, fast, nimble brand price pack channel architecture that is designed to ensure that we don't have to take across-the-board pricing. And that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in such troubling macroeconomic -- in such a troubling microeconomic environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be inflationary period coming, that will benefit us overall as a business, as a system, as a structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all the plants that are in the impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel obviously because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. So there is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to have some impact. And then overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to empty out the warehouses, in terms of being able to distribute effectively. All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in the quarter in Japan until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum on top of a good year last year with our brand, with our portfolio, all 4 cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, fundamentals of the business is really the brand health. And given, and our bottlers are investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in normalizing the business in Japan. So overall, I think Gary mentioned the sort of scope of what may be the impact and we'll try to mitigate everything we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that."

All the plants are back up and running. But we've got the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses and those are not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar referenced, you've got in product mix as well. But probably most importantly and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers would be just running plants fullbore, kind of building finished stock inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that we're not going to be able to supply the demand we believe, because we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's -- we think we saw an impact in the first quarter that will probably rebound a little bit in the second quarter, just around concentrate shipments and then it's going to reverse back in the third. And fourth quarters kind of what we think is going to happen."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We are winning share in the marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coca-Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold. 
And we are winning with our global still beverage portfolio, as Del Valle, the brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision, together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthquake and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely thank our leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time of crisis. I'd also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been diligently producing, distributing beverages to affected areas and restoring our business operations. 
Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first-hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given our nearly 60-year presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery, relief and rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the ongoing relief efforts including donations of over $7 million bottles of product. Through our Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country.
As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the hardest-hit regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also announced plans to reduce our power usage in the Southern and East Japan mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of the community, while ensuring our machines stay on and in support of small businesses which rely on the vending channel.
With regard to this quarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light of recent events, we are actively reevaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and consumer needs. 
As this topic is top-of-mind for many of our shareowners, Gary will review later in our call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent events may have on our business in Japan.  And be assured that in the coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this evolving operating environment.
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long-term growth target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we achieve these performance results despite natural disasters, political uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices.
As the global recovery and greater volatility continue, we may see some bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will continue to meet and exceed our long-term growth targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This marks a fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for North America. And importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter. 
In the United States, trademark Coca-Cola gained share, while Diet Coke was named the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero once again delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respectively, this past quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long-term growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North America juices and juice drink business delivered positive growth this quarter, fueled once again by our Simply brand which grew 20%. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value share in the U.S. 
Our glac√©au brands gained volume and value share this quarter growing 12%, with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this past quarter and, once again, outperforming the North America sports drink category. 
Our North America tea business extended its momentum, delivering 12% growth for the quarter. 
We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top-selling organic bottled tea company. We are excited to fully welcome this great and innovative brand to our family. 
In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as planned. At the same time, we're leveraging our strong marketing and sales capabilities to accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double-digit growth in China was driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and sustained investment in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, with both also growing double digits. In fact, our sparkling beverage share in China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. 
Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our last earnings call, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand equity. In support of this strategy, we launched the new single-serve 300 ml package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter including 5% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Latin America's broad-based growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coca-Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico this past quarter, continuing a trend we have consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years. 
Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unseasonably cold and wet weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single-digit growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% this past quarter led by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca-Cola grew 24% in Russia, posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Additionally, Fanta and Sprite also delivered strong double-digit growth in Russia this past quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, contributing more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage growth in Russia this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarter and gained sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca-Cola, up a strong 19%. 
India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results growing 9%. This now marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. India, also, once again delivered balanced growth across our entire portfolio, with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter.
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive quarter of positive growth despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca-Cola also up 1%, and Coca-Cola Zero kept its strong momentum in Europe increasing double digits once again. 
Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Germany delivered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share gains. 
Finally our business in Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Now let's return to a few of the global brands' success stories referenced at the start of today's call.  Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is also our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold, joining Coca-Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca-Cola. Building on this momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This highlights both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in investing behind our global brands. 
I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. When we partnered with Coca-Cola Fanta to jointly acquire the Jugos del Valle business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have expanded Del Valle to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries making Del Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America region.
If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is the latest example of how our global system can be so nimble and flexible as well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle have all followed unique paths to success. Simply represents a classic case study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our existing juice portfolio in order to take juices and juice drink category leadership in the United States. 
Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed a unique brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leveraged our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle stands as a prime illustration of how we can partner with our system to quickly achieve scale and address an area of opportunity in our beverage portfolio all across Latin America.  The growth of these brands played a significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juices and juice drinks. Yet, we believe we have really just begun to tap our global potential in this key beverage category.
As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. I've mentioned the work we're doing to support the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part of our company's DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on transforming lives and empowering communities across the African continent. We are involved in programs focused on improving access to clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training among others. Over the past decade, the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next decade, the foundation is committed to expanding its footprint and to implementing a project in every country on the continent.
Another way we are building for a better tomorrow is by further advancing our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable plastic bottle but is made with plant-based materials resulting in a lighter footprint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all DASANI and Odwalla single-serve bottles in the United States would now be available in our PlantBottle. In fact, Odwalla's new packaging is entirely composed of materials derived from sugarcane, making our company the first to develop and enter the market with 100% plant-based, fully recyclable package. 
And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United States. We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the environment.
As we build for a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. DiversityBusiness magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison Awards, including a Silver Award in the Packaging category for our PlantBottle and a Gold Award in the New Retail Frontiers category for our Freestyle fountain drink dispenser. 
While all of us at the Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is our good fortune to steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the backdrop of a global economy that is still rebalancing. So there is no question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. Yet, this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. 
In fact, since day one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering the middle class in the next decade, the corresponding political economic and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of cities, personal mobility, technology and education. 
Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great challenges. Yet, together with our bottling partners, we've been preparing for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength. The growing strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically advancing our global momentum. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that our system is well positioned to meet and exceed our long-term targets and to usher in a new era of winning for all of our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,127928847,117674,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We fee",2264,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. 
As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We feel particularly good about these results since we delivered them while productively integrating our North America business and while navigating several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment. 
While, as expected, there are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that except for Japan, we do not see any of these puts and takes changing our full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this quarter's good results are a testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in keeping with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets. 
So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter.  As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year and in line with our long-term growth targets. While this result came in $0.01 below consensus and many analyst models, it includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of marketing expenses as we are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business to the Coca-Cola Company's accounting policies. 
Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in plain English. As many of you know, we apply something we call a sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we recognize marketing on a pennies-per-case basis. So, basically, the same pennies-per-case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing across the year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize the costs over the full year in line with our estimated volume along with all the other marketing. 
Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing expenses associated with our newly acquired North American business. The application of this sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about this accounting adjustment until we finalized our quarterly business plan spreads, we realize out that many of you do not have this accounting reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going forward, please note that this sales curve dilution will reverse itself in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, our business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 dilutive effect on our first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging and channel mix.
Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter primarily related to bottler assistance and our $31 million Reconstruction Fund that totaled approximately $80 million dollars. These are duly reflected in our GAAP, non-GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable results.
Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further influence our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, our Japan team is doing everything they can to restore our business in Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll keep providing routine and all new on updates regarding our business in Japan.
We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our updated currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies. 
Since our last earnings call in February, we've seen a higher benefit than expected from currency. Considering both our hedged positions and current spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that since our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is not a commodity that can be hedged, we are actively pursuing and executing plans to mitigate and offset some of this increase, including the acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall commodity exposure.  
In addition, we are strategically leveraging our brand pack channel and pricing strategies where and when appropriate to further balance this exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% starting in April.  As a result and based on our current and best estimates, we expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts as well as our improved currency benefits to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million increase in 2011 commodity costs exposure over the course of this year. 
And please note that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Consistent with how we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net unrealized hedge gains in the notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedule and will continue to do so in our future earnings reports.
Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating results. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is operating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In addition, we now have single sales teams that sell of our products across customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands were sold prior to the Coca-Cola Enterprises North America transaction. 
Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a necessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results proportions of Coca-Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North America. This means that when reviewing our North America and total company results, there will be several financial statement line items and calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the past and will continue to look different through the balance of this year until we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you with comparable currency neutral results consistent with how we've always communicated our results. Having said that, we recognize that some line items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to always provide you with as complete a picture of our underlying business performance as possible.
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to our recent CCE transaction. 
This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We understand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We, therefore, estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined international and Bottling Investment Group price mix was up 2% this quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this quarter in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long-term growth targets.
Looking at a few other line items, where these calculations where influenced this quarter by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To better understand this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated results in pieces. 
First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses resulting in unfavorable operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the year until we fully cycle that acquisition. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line with the guidance provided in our last call. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and considering the dilutive effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the full year. Similarly and not surprising, our gross margins for this quarter were also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction that results as North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and our Bottling Investments Group saw positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth in the quarter after excluding structural items.
Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans as part of our previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million. So pretty much all of it already contributed in the quarter. 
Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related to our 2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011.  With regard to our share repurchase program, we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at least $2 billion and $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of the full year. 
As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in Embonor and, thus, will no longer recognize equity income from Embonor results.  Looking forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger between the Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate there, when you consider the sale of our ownership stake of  Embonor as well as the expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Arca-Continental merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately $0.01 on a full year basis.  Finally with respect to our tax rate, our underlying effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of between 23.5% and 24.5% provided in our last call.
 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another quarter of solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We remain confident that we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands and driving long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

And I'm very pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coke, again, grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in addition, Fanta, which is our fourth global brand, passing the $10 billion retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding our cross-licensed brands of 6% internationally, and if you look at -- it's important to look at what we're cycling each quarter. We are consistently delivering volume growth in line with our long-term targets or above. And what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 5%. So we're actually increasing the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 was 5% international. We're, again, accelerating that growth in the midst of huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us confidence as we go into the year. And, again, when you look at our U.S. business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we're investing. As we do this, our brands are now getting healthier. Our share results, market share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that shows by category, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a very long time. So again, India and China, you've referenced, I think, China as we -- Q1 sparkling gained volume share. Q1 still gained volume and value share, and sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. And we're making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our bottlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come -- are all contributing to being a part of the communities that they serve. And that India, again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 2011 and chose to maintain it in the face of aggressive discounting from various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with brand Coke growing, Sprite growing, thumbs up we're growing in a very healthy manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So, overall, that gives me confidence when I see our brands. And just last point in China, Pulpy was up, again, almost 30%, and then you asked about the Philippines. I think Philippines post-elections have been a very challenging environment after the heat -- the economy was heated artificially pre-elections, and what we're doing is making sure that our business stays healthy. We invest in our brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long term. And as far as Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So we're happy with the healthy performance also of BIG. Germany, as you can see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates to discounts or so. We are winning, again, in all channels in Germany now, and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I frame your question, Carlos."

But if you just put those things together, right there, that's 2 to 3 points on OI growth, just those 2 things. And then the hedges that we took, the commodity hedge gains, that's another $36 million, another $0.01. We took those out. Those will go back in kind of primarily third quarter-ish timing. But that's another 1.5 points of growth on OI. So that's why we feel comfortable. I mean, it's a dynamic world out there. But we feel comfortable with all the puts and takes.

That's the second quarter in a row. And prior to this, you'd need to note that transactions had declined every quarter dating back all the way to 2007. So that's something that, again, we're focusing on very heavily to continue to drive transaction. So, I think, in regards to transactions overall, we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that somewhat compensates also for the price of the increases that had been referenced as 1% to 2% in the last call. What I'd like to, also, frame for the remainder of the year, though, is that we will be looking at every opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like, maybe, 3% to 4%, as we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And, at the same time, we will be diligently, again, putting all our efforts to grow IC transactions in the United States. And recognizing that  higher price increase may have some volume impact, but driving transactions will be the key in North America. And I don't know if Gary would like to add to your other question that is related to the revenue realization given that the business is now operating as one integrated business. One other thing I'd like to add is that, again, the 16-ounce package was up double digits again in the quarter, which is giving us, again, goods metrics for the future."

Just a couple of things on North America that I want to focus on and reemphasize one thing that Muhtar just said as well. When we look at it, we took different pricing percentages on different packages and different channels, obviously, as you would expect in North America. But the weighted average of all of that is in the 1% to 2% range. That's announced. That's in the market, and we're getting that. So we have to kind of look at the scanner data that you're referring to because a lot of -- remember that Nielsen and ROI only covers about, I think, about 40% of the U.S., our U.S. market, that there's so much that, that's not in Nielsen and ROI. So that's the large part out of it. But then, as Muhtar says, we're going to look at additional pricing this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to emphasize something else he was talking about, which is on driving, on transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but transactions is really about creating health for the brand, wealth and really drives sustainable long-term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us downsize packages in North America going to the 14- and 16-ounce and the reason to do that was to drive transactions and recruit and rerecruit users of our brands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind of price increase as well, where you downsize a package but hold the price and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets around the world as we talked about it. So, all in all, I think you're seeing some actions that we're taking that we think will prove good long term for the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well."

Yes, you were right in saying and looking at the fact that, as far as commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system point of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase would you need. All we can signal is that as, obviously, you mentioned -- you heard me talk about -- I mean it's consumption, this is growing. That is a big benefit, when you have -- because those packages have a higher margin. They have a higher price. And as the mix shifts in favor of immediate consumption, then, obviously, we get the benefit and a windfall, and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me, again, in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in China. You see us doing the same thing in the Philippines, across the whole world, Germany many new packages. So I think we're employing a much more flexible, fast, nimble brand-priced pack channel architecture that is designed to ensure that we don't have to take across-the-board pricing. And that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in such troubling macroeconomic -- in such a troubling microeconomic environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be an inflationary period coming, that will benefit us overall as a business, as a system, as a structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all the plants that are in the impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel, obviously, because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. So there is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to have some impact. And then, overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to empty out the warehouses, in terms of being able to distribute effectively. All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in the quarter in Japan until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum on top of a good year last year with our brands, with our portfolio, all 4 cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, one fundamental of the business is really the brand health. And given -- and our bottlers are investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in normalizing the business in Japan. So, overall, I think Gary mentioned the sort of scope of what may be the impact, and we'll try to mitigate everything we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that."

All the plants are back up and running. But we've got -- the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses, and those are not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar referenced, you've got in shifts in product mix as well. But probably and most importantly, and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers would be just running plants full bore, kind of building finished stock inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that we're not going to be able to supply all the demands, as we believe, because we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's -- well, we think we saw an impact in the first quarter that will probably rebound a little bit in the second quarter just around concentrate shipments, and then it's going to reverse back in the third and fourth quarter is kind of what we think is going to happen."

The pricing environment potentially improving in North America in the balance of the year, is that more in the sparkling side of the portfolio or more in the still side? And I assume the more robust expectation is due more to less price increases as opposed to mix, is that correct?"

I was going to say not as simple as you would think it would be because you, basically, got different pricing on different packages, on different brands by channel, and so you're going -- you've got different elasticities of demand by package. So you're going to implement different pricing for those different SKUs at about by channel. But we are expecting to see, we have talked about 1% to 2% pricing in North America. We're now saying that we're going to probably be going for more pricing than that this year, and a lot of that is just strictly the environment that we're in. So that's the way we see it right now."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We are winning share in the marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coca-Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold. 
And we are winning with our global still beverage portfolio, as Del Valle, the brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision, together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthquake and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely thank our leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time of crisis. I'd also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been diligently producing, distributing beverages to affected areas and restoring our business operations. 
Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first-hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given our nearly 60-year presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery, relief and rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the ongoing relief efforts including donations of over $7 million bottles of product. Through our Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country.
As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the hardest-hit regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also announced plans to reduce our power usage this summer in East Japan mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of the community, while ensuring our machines stay on and in support of small businesses which rely on the vending channel.
With regard to this quarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light of recent events, we are actively reevaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and consumer needs. 
As this topic is top-of-mind for many of our shareowners, Gary will review later in our call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent events may have on our business in Japan.  And be assured that in the coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this evolving operating environment.
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long-term growth target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we achieve these performance results despite natural disasters, political uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices.
As the global recovery and greater volatility continue, we may see some bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will continue to meet and exceed our long-term growth targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This marks a fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for North America. And importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter. 
In the United States, trademark Coca-Cola gained share, while Diet Coke was named the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero once again delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respectively, this past quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long-term growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North America juices and juice drink business delivered positive growth this quarter, fueled once again by our Simply brand which grew 20%. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value share in the U.S. 
Our glac√©au brands gained volume and value share this quarter growing 12%, with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this past quarter and, once again, outperforming the North America sports drink category. 
Our North America tea business extended its momentum, delivering 12% growth for the quarter. 
We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top-selling organic bottled tea company. We are excited to fully welcome this great and innovative brand to our family. 
In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as planned. At the same time, we're leveraging our strong marketing and sales capabilities to accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double-digit growth in China was driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and sustained investment in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, with both also growing double digits. In fact, our sparkling beverage share in China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. 
Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our last earnings call, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand equity. In support of this strategy, we launched the new single-serve 300 ml package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter including 5% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Latin America's broad-based growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coca-Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico this past quarter, continuing a trend we have consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years. 
Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unseasonably cold and wet weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single-digit growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% this past quarter led by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca-Cola grew 24% in Russia, posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Additionally, Fanta and Sprite also delivered strong double-digit growth in Russia this past quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, contributing more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage growth in Russia this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarter and gained sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca-Cola, up a strong 19%. 
India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results growing 9%. This now marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. India, also, once again delivered balanced growth across our entire portfolio, with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter.
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive quarter of positive growth despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca-Cola also up 1%, and Coca-Cola Zero kept its strong momentum in Europe increasing double digits once again. 
Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Germany delivered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share gains. 
Finally our business in Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Now let's return to a few of the global brands' success stories referenced at the start of today's call.  Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is also our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold, joining Coca-Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca-Cola. Building on this momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This highlights both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in investing behind our global brands. 
I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. When we partnered with Coca-Cola Fanta to jointly acquire the Jugos del Valle business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have expanded Del Valle to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries making Del Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America region.
If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is the latest example of how our global system can be so nimble and flexible as well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle have all followed unique paths to success. Simply represents a classic case study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our existing juice portfolio in order to take juices and juice drink category leadership in the United States. 
Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed a unique brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leveraged our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle stands as a prime illustration of how we can partner with our system to quickly achieve scale and address an area of opportunity in our beverage portfolio all across Latin America.  The growth of these brands played a significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juices and juice drinks. Yet, we believe we have really just begun to tap our global potential in this key beverage category.
As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. I've mentioned the work we're doing to support the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part of our company's DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on transforming lives and empowering communities across the African continent. We are involved in programs focused on improving access to clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training among others. Over the past decade, the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next decade, the foundation is committed to expanding its footprint and to implementing a project in every country on the continent.
Another way we are building for a better tomorrow is by further advancing our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable plastic bottle but is made with plant-based materials resulting in a lighter footprint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all DASANI and Odwalla single-serve bottles in the United States would now be available in our PlantBottle. In fact, Odwalla's new packaging is entirely composed of materials derived from sugarcane, making our company the first to develop and enter the market with 100% plant-based, fully recyclable package. 
And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United States. We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the environment.
As we build for a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. DiversityBusiness magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison Awards, including a Silver Award in the Packaging category for our PlantBottle and a Gold Award in the New Retail Frontiers category for our Freestyle fountain drink dispenser. 
While all of us at the Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is our good fortune to steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the backdrop of a global economy that is still rebalancing. So there is no question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. Yet, this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. 
In fact, since day one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering the middle class in the next decade, the corresponding political economic and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of cities, personal mobility, technology and education. 
Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great challenges. Yet, together with our bottling partners, we've been preparing for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength. The growing strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically advancing our global momentum. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that our system is well positioned to meet and exceed our long-term targets and to usher in a new era of winning for all of our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,127928847,117826,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We fee",2264,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. 
As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We feel particularly good about these results since we delivered them while productively integrating our North America business and while navigating several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment. 
While, as expected, there are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that except for Japan, we do not see any of these puts and takes changing our full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this quarter's good results are a testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in keeping with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets. 
So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter.  As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year and in line with our long-term growth targets. While this result came in $0.01 below consensus in many analyst models, it includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of marketing expenses as we are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business to the Coca-Cola Company's accounting policies. 
Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in plain English. As many of you know, we apply something we call a sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we recognize marketing on a pennies-per-case basis. So, basically, the same pennies-per-case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing across the year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize the costs over the full year in line with our estimated volume along with all the other marketing. 
Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing expenses associated with our newly acquired North American business. The application of this sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about this accounting adjustment until we finalized our quarterly business plan spreads, we realize out that many of you do not have this accounting reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going forward, please note that this sales curve dilution will reverse itself in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, our business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 dilutive effect on our first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging and channel mix.
Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter primarily related to bottler assistance and our $31 million Reconstruction Fund that totaled approximately $80 million dollars. These are duly reflected in our GAAP, non-GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable results.
Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further influence our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, our Japan team is doing everything they can to restore our business in Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll keep providing routine and all new on updates regarding our business in Japan.
We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our updated currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies. 
Since our last earnings call in February, we've seen a higher benefit than expected from currency. Considering both our hedged positions and current spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that since our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is not a commodity that can be hedged, we are actively pursuing and executing plans to mitigate and offset some of this increase, including the acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall commodity exposure.  
In addition, we are strategically leveraging our brand pack channel and pricing strategies where and when appropriate to further balance this exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% starting in April.  As a result and based on our current and best estimates, we expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts as well as our improved currency benefits to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million increase in 2011 commodity costs exposure over the course of this year. 
And please note that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Consistent with how we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net unrealized hedge gains in the notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedule and will continue to do so in our future earnings reports.
Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating results. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is operating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In addition, we now have single sales teams that sell of our products across customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands were sold prior to the Coca-Cola Enterprises North America transaction. 
Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a necessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results proportions of Coca-Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North America. This means that when reviewing our North America and total company results, there will be several financial statement line items and calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the past and will continue to look different through the balance of this year until we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you with comparable currency neutral results consistent with how we've always communicated our results. Having said that, we recognize that some line items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to always provide you with as complete a picture of our underlying business performance as possible.
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to our recent CCE transaction. 
This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We understand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We, therefore, estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined international and Bottling Investment Group price mix was up 2% this quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this quarter in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long-term growth targets.
Looking at a few other line items, where those calculations where influenced this quarter by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To better understand this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated results in pieces. 
First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses resulting in unfavorable operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the year until we fully cycle that acquisition. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line with the guidance provided in our last call. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and considering the dilutive effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the full year. Similarly and not surprising, our gross margins for this quarter were also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction that results as North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and our Bottling Investments Group saw positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth in the quarter after excluding structural items.
Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans as part of our previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million. So pretty much all of it already contributed in the quarter. 
Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related to our 2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011.  With regard to our share repurchase program, we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at least $2 billion and $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of the full year. 
As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in Embonor and, thus, will no longer recognize equity income from Embonor results.  Looking forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger between the Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate there, when you consider the sale of our ownership stake of  Embonor as well as the expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Arca-Continental merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately $0.01 on a full year basis.  Finally with respect to our tax rate, our underlying effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of between 23.5% and 24.5% provided in our last call.
 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another quarter of solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We remain confident that we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands and driving long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

I think what you saw in the first quarter global -- huge global geopolitical challenges, natural disasters. And I'm very pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coke, again, grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in addition, Fanta, which is our fourth global brand, passing the $10 billion retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding our cross-licensed brands of 6% internationally, and if you look at -- it's important to look at what we're cycling each quarter. We are consistently delivering volume growth in line with our long-term targets or above. And what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 5%. So we're actually increasing the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 was 5% international. We're, again, accelerating that growth in the midst of huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us confidence as we go into the year. And, again, when you look at our U.S. business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we're investing. As we do this, our brands are now getting healthier. Our share results, market share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that shows by category, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a very long time. So again, India and China, you've referenced, I think, China as we -- Q1 sparkling gained volume share. Q1 still gained volume and value share, and sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. And we're making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our bottlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come -- are all contributing to being a part of the communities that they serve. And that India, again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 2011 and chose to maintain it in the face of aggressive discounting from various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with brand Coke growing, Sprite growing, thumbs up we're growing in a very healthy manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So, overall, that gives me confidence when I see our brands. And just last point in China, Pulpy was up, again, almost 30%, and then you asked about the Philippines. I think Philippines post-elections have been a very challenging environment after the heat -- the economy was heated artificially pre-elections, and what we're doing is making sure that our business stays healthy. We invest in our brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long term. And as far as the Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So we're happy with the healthy performance also of BIG. Germany, as you can see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates to discounts or so. We are winning, again, in all channels in Germany now, and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I frame your question, Carlos."

So that's something that, again, we're focusing on very heavily to continue to drive transaction. So, I think, in regards to transactions overall, we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that somewhat compensates also for the price of the increases that had been referenced as 1% to 2% in the last call. What I'd like to, also, frame for the remainder of the year, though, is that we will be looking at every opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like, maybe, 3% to 4%, as we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And, at the same time, we will be diligently, again, putting all our efforts to grow IC transactions in the United States. And recognizing that  higher price increase may have some volume impact, but driving transactions will be the key in North America.

So that's the large part out of it. But then, as Muhtar says, we're going to look at additional pricing this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to emphasize something else he was talking about, which is on driving, on transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but transactions is really about creating health for the brand, wealth and really drives sustainable long-term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us downsize packages in North America going to the 14- and 16-ounce and the reason to do that was to drive transactions and recruit and rerecruit users of our brands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind of price increase as well, where you downsize a package but hold the price and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets around the world as we talked about it. So, all in all, I think you're seeing some actions that we're taking that we think will prove good long term for the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well."

And then I'm just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about how things are operating in Japan and where the earnings drag might be? Is it a mix shift? Is it that you need to give away product? Is it the cost of doing business? Just a little more insight into Japan."

Yes, you were right in saying and looking at the fact that, as far as commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system point of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase would you need. All we can signal is that as, obviously, you mentioned -- you heard me talk about -- I mean it's consumption, this is growing. That is a big benefit, when you have -- because those packages have a higher margin. They have a higher price. And as the mix shifts in favor of immediate consumption, then, obviously, we get the benefit and a windfall, and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me, again, in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in China. You see us doing the same thing in the Philippines, across the whole world, Germany many new packages. So I think we're employing a much more flexible, fast, nimble brand-priced pack channel architecture that is designed to ensure that we don't have to take across-the-board pricing. And that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in such troubling macroeconomic -- in such a troubling microeconomic environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be an inflationary period coming, that will benefit us overall as a business, as a system, as a structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all the plants that are in the impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel, obviously, because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. So there is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to have some impact. And then, overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to empty out the warehouses, in terms of being able to distribute effectively. All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in the quarter in Japan until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum on top of a good year last year with our brands, with our portfolio, all 4 cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, one fundamental of the business is really the brand health. And given -- and our bottlers are investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in normalizing the business in Japan. So, overall, I think Gary mentioned the sort of scope of what may be the impact, and we'll try to mitigate everything we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that."

All the plants are back up and running. But we've got -- the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses, and those are not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar referenced, you've got in shifts in product mix as well. But probably and most importantly, and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers would be just running plants full bore, kind of building finished stock inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that we're not going to be able to supply all the demands, as we believe, because we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's -- well, we think we saw an impact in the first quarter that will probably rebound a little bit in the second quarter just around concentrate shipments, and then it's going to reverse back in the third and fourth quarter is kind of what we think is going to happen."

So you're going to implement different pricing for those different SKUs at about by channel. But we are expecting to see, we have talked about 1% to 2% pricing in North America.

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We are winning share in the marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coca-Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold. 
And we are winning with our global still beverage portfolio, as Del Valle, the brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision, together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthquake and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely thank our leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time of crisis. I'd also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been diligently producing, distributing beverages to affected areas and restoring our business operations. 
Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first-hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given our nearly 60-year presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery, relief and rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the ongoing relief efforts including donations of over $7 million bottles of product. Through our Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country.
As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the hardest-hit regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also announced plans to reduce our power usage this summer in East Japan mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of the community, while ensuring our machines stay on and in support of small businesses which rely on the vending channel.
With regard to this quarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light of recent events, we are actively reevaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and consumer needs. 
As this topic is top-of-mind for many of our shareowners, Gary will review later in our call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent events may have on our business in Japan.  And be assured that in the coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this evolving operating environment.
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long-term growth target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we achieve these performance results despite natural disasters, political uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices.
As the global recovery and greater volatility continue, we may see some bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will continue to meet and exceed our long-term growth targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This marks a fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for North America. And importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter. 
In the United States, trademark Coca-Cola gained share, while Diet Coke was named the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero once again delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respectively, this past quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long-term growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North America juices and juice drink business delivered positive growth this quarter, fueled once again by our Simply brand which grew 20%. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value share in the U.S. 
Our glac√©au brands gained volume and value share this quarter growing 12%, with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this past quarter and, once again, outperforming the North America sports drink category. 
Our North America tea business extended its momentum, delivering 12% growth for the quarter. 
We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top-selling organic bottled tea company. We are excited to fully welcome this great and innovative brand to our family. 
In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as planned. At the same time, we're leveraging our strong marketing and sales capabilities to accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double-digit growth in China was driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and sustained investment in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, with both also growing double digits. In fact, our sparkling beverage share in China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. 
Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our last earnings call, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand equity. In support of this strategy, we launched the new single-serve 300 ml package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer.
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter including 5% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Latin America's broad-based growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coca-Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico this past quarter, continuing a trend we have consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years. 
Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unseasonably cold and wet weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single-digit growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% this past quarter led by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca-Cola grew 24% in Russia, posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Additionally, Fanta and Sprite also delivered strong double-digit growth in Russia this past quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, contributing more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage growth in Russia this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarter and gained sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca-Cola, up a strong 19%. 
India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results growing 9%. This now marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. India, also, once again delivered balanced growth across our entire portfolio, with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter.
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive quarter of positive growth despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca-Cola also up 1%, and Coca-Cola Zero kept its strong momentum in Europe increasing double digits once again. 
Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Germany delivered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share gains. 
Finally our business in Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Now let's return to a few of the global brands' success stories referenced at the start of today's call.  Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is also our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold, joining Coca-Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca-Cola. Building on this momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This highlights both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in investing behind our global brands. 
I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. When we partnered with Coca-Cola Fanta to jointly acquire the Jugos del Valle business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have expanded Del Valle to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries making Del Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America region.
If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is the latest example of how our global system can be so nimble and flexible as well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle have all followed unique paths to success. Simply represents a classic case study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our existing juice portfolio in order to take juices and juice drink category leadership in the United States. 
Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed a unique brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leveraged our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle stands as a prime illustration of how we can partner with our system to quickly achieve scale and address an area of opportunity in our beverage portfolio all across Latin America.  The growth of these brands played a significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juices and juice drinks. Yet, we believe we have really just begun to tap our global potential in this key beverage category.
As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. I've mentioned the work we're doing to support the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part of our company's DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on transforming lives and empowering communities across the African continent. We are involved in programs focused on improving access to clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training among others. Over the past decade, the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next decade, the foundation is committed to expanding its footprint and to implementing a project in every country on the continent.
Another way we are building for a better tomorrow is by further advancing our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable plastic bottle but is made with plant-based materials resulting in a lighter footprint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all DASANI and Odwalla single-serve bottles in the United States would now be available in our PlantBottle. In fact, Odwalla's new packaging is entirely composed of materials derived from sugarcane, making our company the first to develop and enter the market with 100% plant-based, fully recyclable package. 
And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United States. We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the environment.
As we build for a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. DiversityBusiness magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison Awards, including a Silver Award in the Packaging category for our PlantBottle and a Gold Award in the New Retail Frontiers category for our Freestyle fountain drink dispenser. 
While all of us at the Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is our good fortune to steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the backdrop of a global economy that is still rebalancing. So there is no question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. Yet, this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. 
In fact, since day one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering the middle class in the next decade, the corresponding political economic and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of cities, personal mobility, technology and education. 
Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great challenges. Yet, together with our bottling partners, we've been preparing for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength. The growing strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically advancing our global momentum. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that our system is well positioned to meet and exceed our long-term targets and to usher in a new era of winning for all of our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,127928847,118022,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We fee",2264,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. 
As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations.  We feel particularly good about these results since we delivered them while productively integrating our North America business and while navigating several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment. 
While, as expected, there are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that except for Japan, we do not see any of these puts and takes changing our full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this quarter's good results are a testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in keeping with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets. 
So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter.  As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year and in line with our long-term growth targets. While this result came in $0.01 below consensus in many analyst models, it includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of marketing expenses as we are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business to the Coca-Cola Company's accounting policies. 
Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in plain English. As many of you know, we apply something we call a sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we recognize marketing on a pennies-per-case basis. So, basically, the same pennies-per-case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing across the year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize the costs over the full year in line with our estimated volume along with all the other marketing. 
Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing expenses associated with our newly acquired North American business. The application of this sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about this accounting adjustment until we finalized our quarterly business plan spreads, we realize out that many of you do not have this accounting reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going forward, please note that this sales curve dilution will reverse itself in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, our business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 dilutive effect on our first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging and channel mix.
Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter primarily related to bottler assistance and our $31 million Reconstruction Fund that totaled approximately $80 million dollars. These are duly reflected in our GAAP, non-GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable results.
Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further influence our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, our Japan team is doing everything they can to restore our business in Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll keep providing routine and all new on updates regarding our business in Japan.
We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our updated currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies. 
Since our last earnings call in February, we've seen a higher benefit than expected from currency. Considering both our hedged positions and current spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that since our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is not a commodity that can be hedged, we are actively pursuing and executing plans to mitigate and offset some of this increase, including the acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall commodity exposure.  
In addition, we are strategically leveraging our brand pack channel and pricing strategies where and when appropriate to further balance this exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% starting in April.  As a result and based on our current and best estimates, we expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts as well as our improved currency benefits to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million increase in 2011 commodity costs exposure over the course of this year. 
And please note that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Consistent with how we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net unrealized hedge gains in the notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedule and will continue to do so in our future earnings reports.
Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating results. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is operating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In addition, we now have single sales teams that sell of our products across customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands were sold prior to the Coca-Cola Enterprises North America transaction. 
Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a necessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results proportions of Coca-Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North America. This means that when reviewing our North America and total company results, there will be several financial statement line items and calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the past and will continue to look different through the balance of this year until we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you with comparable currency neutral results consistent with how we've always communicated our results. Having said that, we recognize that some line items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to always provide you with as complete a picture of our underlying business performance as possible.
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to our recent CCE transaction. 
This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We understand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We, therefore, estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined international and Bottling Investment Group price mix was up 2% this quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this quarter in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long-term growth targets.
Looking at a few other line items, where those calculations where influenced this quarter by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To better understand this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated results in pieces. 
First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses resulting in unfavorable operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the year until we fully cycle that acquisition. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line with the guidance provided in our last call. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and considering the dilutive effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the full year. Similarly and not surprising, our gross margins for this quarter were also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction that results as North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and our Bottling Investments Group saw positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth in the quarter after excluding structural items.
Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans as part of our previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million. So pretty much all of it already contributed in the quarter. 
Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related to our 2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011.  With regard to our share repurchase program, we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at least $2 billion and $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of the full year. 
As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in Embonor and, thus, will no longer recognize equity income from Embonor results.  Looking forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger between the Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate there, when you consider the sale of our ownership stake of  Embonor as well as the expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Arca-Continental merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately $0.01 on a full year basis.  Finally with respect to our tax rate, our underlying effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of between 23.5% and 24.5% provided in our last call.
 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another quarter of solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We remain confident that we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands and driving long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

I think what you saw in the first quarter global -- huge global geopolitical challenges, natural disasters. And I'm very pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coke, again, grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in addition, Fanta, which is our fourth global brand, passing the $10 billion retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding our cross-licensed brands of 6% internationally, and if you look at -- it's important to look at what we're cycling each quarter. We are consistently delivering volume growth in line with our long-term targets or above. And what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 5%. So we're actually increasing the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 was 5% international. We're, again, accelerating that growth in the midst of huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us confidence as we go into the year. And, again, when you look at our U.S. business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we're investing. As we do this, our brands are now getting healthier. Our share results, market share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that shows by category, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a very long time. So again, India and China, you've referenced, I think, China as we -- Q1 sparkling gained volume share. Q1 still gained volume and value share, and sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. And we're making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our bottlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come -- are all contributing to being a part of the communities that they serve. And that India, again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 2011 and chose to maintain it in the face of aggressive discounting from various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with brand Coke growing, Sprite growing, thumbs up we're growing in a very healthy manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So, overall, that gives me confidence when I see our brands. And just last point in China, Pulpy was up, again, almost 30%, and then you asked about the Philippines. I think Philippines post-elections have been a very challenging environment after the heat -- the economy was heated artificially pre-elections, and what we're doing is making sure that our business stays healthy. We invest in our brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long term. And as far as the Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So we're happy with the healthy performance also of BIG. Germany, as you can see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates to discounts or so. We are winning, again, in all channels in Germany now, and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I frame your question, Carlos."

With the 7% operating profit growth in the quarter, currency neutral, you mentioned the commodity hedged timing, the market spend timing, we also have the Easter shift and 1 less shipping day. So trying to best understand your underlying operating profit growth, do you view it as high single digits when you account for those other puts and takes?"

You're now into estimates of what might it have been and those kinds of things, which is why I did not try to actually quantify those. But there are couple of things we know we can quantify. If you put the impact -- if our best estimate is that the impact of Japan is $0.01. The impact of the sales curve on CCR in North America is $0.01 and that wouldn't just reverse this Q1 in Q4. But if you just put those things together, right there, that's 2 to 3 points on OI growth, just those 2 things. And then the hedges that we took, the commodity hedge gains, that's another $36 million, another $0.01. We took those out. Those will go back in kind of primarily third quarter-ish timing. But that's another 1.5 points of growth on OI. So that's why we feel comfortable. I mean, it's a dynamic world out there. But we feel comfortable with all the puts and takes. There's some real bad things like the tragedy in Japan. There's some good things where we've made some decisions to change accounting policies, and it's a Q1, Q4 quarterly thing. It doesn't impact the year at all, but we just think it's the right way to go."

That's the second quarter in a row. And prior to this, you'd need to note that transactions had declined every quarter dating back all the way to 2007. So that's something that, again, we're focusing on very heavily to continue to drive transaction. So, I think, in regards to transactions overall, we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that somewhat compensates also for the price of the increases that had been referenced as 1% to 2% in the last call. What I'd like to, also, frame for the remainder of the year, though, is that we will be looking at every opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like, maybe, 3% to 4%, as we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And, at the same time, we will be diligently, again, putting all our efforts to grow IC transactions in the United States. And recognizing that  higher price increase may have some volume impact, but driving transactions will be the key in North America. And I don't know if Gary would like to add to your other question that is related to the revenue realization given that the business is now operating as one integrated business. One other thing I'd like to add is that, again, the 16-ounce package was up double digits again in the quarter, which is giving us, again, goods metrics for the future."

Just a couple of things on North America that I want to focus on and reemphasize one thing that Muhtar just said as well. When we look at it, we took different pricing percentages on different packages and different channels, obviously, as you would expect in North America. But the weighted average of all of that is in the 1% to 2% range. That's announced. That's in the market, and we're getting that. So we have to kind of look at the scanner data that you're referring to because a lot of -- remember that Nielsen and ROI only covers about, I think, about 40% of the U.S., our U.S. market, that there's so much that, that's not in Nielsen and ROI. So that's the large part out of it. But then, as Muhtar says, we're going to look at additional pricing this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to emphasize something else he was talking about, which is on driving, on transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but transactions is really about creating health for the brand, wealth and really drives sustainable long-term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us downsize packages in North America going to the 14- and 16-ounce and the reason to do that was to drive transactions and recruit and rerecruit users of our brands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind of price increase as well, where you downsize a package but hold the price and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets around the world as we talked about it. So, all in all, I think you're seeing some actions that we're taking that we think will prove good long term for the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well."

Yes, you were right in saying and looking at the fact that, as far as commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system point of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase would you need. All we can signal is that as, obviously, you mentioned -- you heard me talk about -- I mean it's consumption, this is growing. That is a big benefit, when you have -- because those packages have a higher margin. They have a higher price. And as the mix shifts in favor of immediate consumption, then, obviously, we get the benefit and a windfall, and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me, again, in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in China. You see us doing the same thing in the Philippines, across the whole world, Germany many new packages. So I think we're employing a much more flexible, fast, nimble brand-priced pack channel architecture that is designed to ensure that we don't have to take across-the-board pricing. And that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in such troubling macroeconomic -- in such a troubling microeconomic environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be an inflationary period coming, that will benefit us overall as a business, as a system, as a structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all the plants that are in the impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel, obviously, because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. So there is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to have some impact. And then, overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to empty out the warehouses, in terms of being able to distribute effectively. All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in the quarter in Japan until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum on top of a good year last year with our brands, with our portfolio, all 4 cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, one fundamental of the business is really the brand health. And given -- and our bottlers are investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in normalizing the business in Japan. So, overall, I think Gary mentioned the sort of scope of what may be the impact, and we'll try to mitigate everything we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that."

All the plants are back up and running. But we've got -- the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses, and those are not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar referenced, you've got in shifts in product mix as well. But probably and most importantly, and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers would be just running plants full bore, kind of building finished stock inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that we're not going to be able to supply all the demands, as we believe, because we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's -- well, we think we saw an impact in the first quarter that will probably rebound a little bit in the second quarter just around concentrate shipments, and then it's going to reverse back in the third and fourth quarter is kind of what we think is going to happen."

So you're going to implement different pricing for those different SKUs at about by channel. But we are expecting to see, we have talked about 1% to 2% pricing in North America.

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive quarter we've either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. We're winning in the marketplace, leveraging our strong brands coupled with strong solid execution to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew at solid 4% in the quarter.  We're winning with our global still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% for the quarter and up 9% year-to-date. And we are achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a testament to our strong brands and solid business fundamentals. 
Before I review our quarterly operating results in more detail, let me take a moment to share some further thoughts on today's mixed global economic landscape. The economic recovery is weak here in the United States as well as in Europe, Japan and across most of the developed Western world. Many middle-class consumers, especially those in developed economies, are still feeling somewhat confused and fragile. At the same time however, many emerging markets are doing quite well especially those in Latin America, Eurasia, key countries like India, China and other fast-growing regions like sub-Saharan Africa. 
With this as a backdrop our folks that are maintaining a long-term vision of where the world is headed and in turn, where the Coca-Cola company wants to go. For us, that road map for winning is represented by our 2020 Vision, a vision shaped together with our global bottling partners and a vision we are confident is ushering in a new era of winning as we continue along the path to 2020. We estimate that by decade's end, there will be 1 billion new consumers entering into the middle class. Additionally, massive urbanization will take place over the next 10 years with another 800 million or so consumers moving to cities. These consumers are going to generate an increased demand for ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages, which is our business. 
Yet with the vision, you also need a conviction and belief followed by investment. To that end, we are investing for growth all around the world in alignment with our global bottling partners. We're investing in highly developed markets such as North America, where we are both investing to support our brands via marketing as well as building facilities, renewing existing facilities and upgrading our selling and execution capabilities. In total, our system has made commitments to invest more than $25 billion over the next 5 years in markets all across the world. Our management's focus and our system-wide investments are paying off today as we execute our 2020 Vision from a position of real strength.
Turning now to our total company performance. We realized strong worldwide volume growth of 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our volume grew 5% for the quarter and year-to-date ahead of our long-term growth target, with over 30% of this quarter's incremental growth generated in our BRIC markets.  As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9%, at the high end of our long-term growth target.
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 4% this quarter with organic volume even versus prior years, cycling 2% organic growth from prior year. Importantly, North America again both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, reaffirming our commitment to driving balanced growth.  
Our investments in sparkling beverages in North America continued paying dividends as we gained volume and value share in the sparkling category this quarter. Coke Zero delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 21st consecutive quarter, while Fanta was up high single digits in the quarter, building on its year-long positive momentum. We're also expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. We're in 50 U.S. markets today, putting us well on track to meet our targets to be in 80 markets by year end. 
As far as still beverages in North America, we delivered positive growth and gain share for the fifth consecutive quarter. A leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth and gained both volume and value share in the sports drink category this quarter. Our energy portfolio saw double-digit volume growth in the quarter with our energy brand up strong 13%. key portfolio delivered mid-single-digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit volume increase for our goalkeeper brand, and our Simply brand delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive growth while also taking industry-leading pricing of 6% to 9%, offsetting commodity pressures. 
We're making excellent progress with our ongoing integration of Coca-Cola Refreshments, which is proceeding as planned and has enabled strong execution of integrated marketing and commercial programs. So as a result, we remain confident that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place for North America as we continue to be excited about the outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are investing for growth across our markets. Overall, the Pacific Group volume was up 7% in the quarter, led by double-digit volume growth in China up 21% and South Korea up 16%. Importantly, we gained both volume and value share in the sparkling category with trademark Coca-Cola up 4% in the Pacific Group for the quarter. In China, trademark Coca-Cola grew 23% this past quarter, its strongest growth since the second quarter of 2004. In total, our year-to-date sales in China are now over 1 billion unit cases. Just to put this in context, our China business first delivered 1 billion unit cases for a full year in 2006, which means that we doubled the size of our China business in just 5 years. 
Looking ahead and as we have noted in previous earnings calls, we're introducing a wider variety of single-serve packages to our sparkling beverage portfolio in China. This is in line with our efforts to focus more on enhancing the consumer experience with our brand and promoting, at the same time, affordability. While this greater emphasis on single-serve packages may lead to some quarter-over-quarter volume fluctuation in the near term, it's also going to drive increased transactions and build brand equity. As such, we are confident we have the right strategies, execution plans as well as capabilities in place in China today to deliver sustainable double-digit growth. 
Japan also delivered positive volume growth, up 1% for the quarter despite the ongoing after-effects of the tragic natural disaster in March. These are better results than we expected when we spoke to you about our Japan business in our last earnings call and is a testament to the strength as well as resilience of our Japanese bottling system. Having said that, we do expect to experience continued challenges in our Japan business during the balance of this year, as we cycle last year's record hot summer conditions and keep working through what is still a difficult environment. Gary is going to provide a more detailed update our business in Japan later in our call.  But looking beyond 2011, we had strong confidence in our business in Japan. This year alone, our great Japanese bottling system have announced investments totaling over $250 million for production capacity improvements, logistics facilities and equipment innovations.
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to generate volume and profit growth across the region with volume up 6% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. We are able to capture this growth through a relentless focus on occasion-based consumer segmentation, combined with best-in-class customer service capabilities. The strategies, which have served us so well in Latin America and many other markets around the world, are the same ones actually we're now actively implementing in North America. 
Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up double digits for the quarter for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 7% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. An interesting data point regarding Mexico this quarter is that our bottling partner of Coca-Cola FENSA sold 125 million unit cases in the month of May alone, the largest monthly sales volume in their history. That this historic milestone occurred in the same month that we were celebrating Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary is more than just coincidence. It's a great testament to the remarkable system partnership we have in place in Mexico today. 
Brazil volume was up 1% for the quarter cycling double-digit growth and reflecting the macro economic slowdown, driven by the government's recent effort to curb inflation. It's important to note that our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, gaining both volume and value share in both sparkling as well as still beverages. This provides us confidence that our strategies are working in Brazil and that we're well positioned to expand our share of industry growth in the years ahead.  And our Argentina business delivered high single-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages.
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, where we are executing with excellence across a diverse geography. Volume grew 7% in the quarter led by strong results in Turkey, Russia and India. Turkey was up 12% this quarter with brand Coca-Cola up 5% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Russia was up 9% this quarter and 16% year-to-date, led by brand Coca-Cola up 17% this past quarter, posting a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
India delivered quality results, growing 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, making this the 20th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this key emerging market. Growth in India was balanced across our portfolio, with both sparkling and still beverages up 8% each. 
Despite geopolitical challenges, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 8% growth as we invest to strengthen our position in this region. We are also investing to enhance our competitive advantage across fast-growing countries in sub-Sahara Africa. Our business in this region was up 6% this quarter, and we believe the opportunity for growth there is significant. GDP forecast for the next 5 years indicate that of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the road, 7 will be located in sub-Sahara Africa, making this region in our view of exciting in BRICS. 
As we move to Europe, the headline here is one of accelerated growth despite a challenging environment, macroeconomic environment. Volume was up 5%, marking Europe's fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, every region of our European business delivered positive growth this past quarter, benefiting from warmer weather as well as excellent in-market activation of our 125th anniversary programs. Our spot beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with trademark Coca-Cola of 6%. And Coca-Cola Zero was up double digits for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our still beverages were also up 5% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in energy beverages and high single-digit growth in teas. Additionally, the further expansion of the Innocent brand fueled our juice and juice drinks growth. 
While every region of our European business delivered volume growth this quarter, Germany led the way with 7%. Our German business benefited from the further evolution of our occasion-based package and price architecture and the successful execution of robust marketing programs centered on our 125th anniversary campaign. Our new marketing programs are also helping us recruit both lost consumers as well as a new generation of teens in this key European market. 
As many of you know, our 2020 Vision outlines the strategic set of priorities across multiple dimensions. From time to time, we will take an opportunity in our earnings calls to highlight these priorities and share how we are advancing. One of our priorities is to win at the point of sale by expanding our investments in immediate consumption. Year-to-date, we are seeing strong momentum against this priority with our immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. And while many still beverages categories contributed to this growth, our immediate consumption sparkling beverages are up 4% year-to-date.  Importantly, each geographic operating group is growing our immediate consumption beverage business on a year-to-date basis. As the world becomes more urban eyes and as more consumers begin to lead on-the-go mobile lifestyle, we see great runway ahead for us and profitable in immediate consumption growth. 
In closing, we're working closely together with our global bottling partners. And the strength of our alignment not only enables us to navigate the current economic and consumer landscape, it also puts us in a position of real strength to deliver our 2020 Vision. Despite the mixed economic recovery all around the globe, consumers are increasingly choosing our brands to refresh themselves at a rate of over 1.7 billion servings every day and growing. Our strong revenue and profit results, combined with our worldwide volume and value share gains and positive price mix, attest to the strength of our global system. 
During this past quarter, we officially celebrated Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary. And while it is wonderfully rewarding to celebrate our past, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our existing future. With our 2020 Vision as our road map, we will continue to execute our strategies with more focus and passion than ever before. That is why as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we have remained confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target and to deliver sustainable profitable growth and value for our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,133558276,142362,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets.

We are pleased with our performance this quarter as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we are achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. As Muhtar said, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.17 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. This brings our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9%, at the high end of our long-term growth target.  
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 18%. This includes a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity costs. This brings our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 14%, including a 4% currency benefit and the commodity headwinds. 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 47% this quarter, including a 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 6% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth was 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, a 4% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined international and Bottling Investments Group price mix was a positive 2% this quarter, and our second quarter pricing to retailers in North America was up between 1% and 2%. To be clear, this is our best estimate of the increased pricing our retail customers pay for our brands. 
In our meetings with you this past quarter, some of the us for additional detail regarding our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy. We believe in executing pricing within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases together with occasion-based package mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and retail pricing growth. So let me update you on the rest of the year outlook with respect to our North America retail pricing strategy. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect to capture between 3% and 4% incremental retail pricing in the back half of 2011, leading to a net full year benefit of between 2% and 3%. We can confirm that we can put into effect incremental pricing program for many of our customers for the rest of this year that will enable us to deliver against this full year retail pricing target. As such, our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy is laser-focused on driving profitable growth, leveraging both rate and mix levers to not just take price, but to earn retail price ahead of inflation and at a premium to our industry. Our system has done this successfully and consistently in North America not just this quarter and not just this year, but on a sustainable year-over-year basis. And I can assure you that we will continue to execute our retail pricing strategies to deliver maximum long-term value, not only to our consumers and our customers, but especially our shareowners.
Turning now to our P&L, our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 47% in the quarter and 48% year-to-date. As we did last quarter, I'll take a moment to review our consolidated SG&A results. The operating segment provides you with a little more context and insight on our results. 
First and as expected, North America SG&A reflects an increase due to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, including the application of the Coca-Cola company's sales curve accounting policy to relate -- to the related CCE North American marketing expenses, as I detailed in our last earnings call. We expect this increase and its corresponding impact on operating expense leverage to remain in place until we fully cycle acquisition of CCE's North American business. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items for both the quarter and year-to-date. This is also to be expected as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets where we see strong long-term growth potential. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A reflects increased direct marketing expenses as we further invest in the health and strength of our brands. And finally, as expected, our currency-neutral corporate expenses are up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date due to the inclusion of corporate expenses related to CCE's North American operations and other investments, primarily in IT. While we considered these collective SG&A increases in the higher commodity costs of served this year, we expect full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investment Group as anticipated since both are finished goods businesses.  As for our international operations, we expect our operating expense leveraged to be even for the full year as we strategically sustain our brand-building investments around the world. 
And for our year-to-date cash flow from operation, this came in at $3.6 billion or $668 million less than in the comparable period last year. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, a business which is historically a net user of cash in the first half of the year. In addition, this cash flow results include a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter this year as discussed in our last earnings call. Net of the pension plan contributions, cash flow from operations were actually up 2% year-to-date. 
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook, starting with how we are successfully managing the currency and commodity environment as both of these items have tended to move in opposite directions this year, serving to partially offset each other's impact. Since our last earnings call in April of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate. In response, we've increased our coverage of most key currencies for the remainder of the year and now expect currencies to have a mid-single-digit positive impact on operating income for the full year. 
As for commodities, we still expect these to have an unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million on our full year results, in line with the same full year forecast we shared last quarter. As communicated earlier, we are implementing retail price increases with our customers who are also pulling forward cost-saving initiatives to help offset some of these commodity costs. 
We continue to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. We also continue to reflect the impact of gains or losses resulting from mark to market of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting in the period that the underlying transaction takes place. As a result in this quarter, we recognized a net $26 million of previously deferred gains primarily related to commodity hedging and have called these out in the schedules and notes to our GAAP, non-GAAP schedules. 
Now let me share our latest views on how we see our recent events in Japan influencing our full year results. As Muhtar mentioned, our second quarter results in Japan came in stronger than anticipated after the earthquake and tsunami. Having said that and consistent with what we shared in our last earnings call, we still expect events in Japan to dilute our full year comparable earnings per share by between $0.03 and $0.05, this impact primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, let me update you on our efforts across several of our ongoing programs starting with our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008. Our original plan, you may remember, target the capture of $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Today, I can confirm that we are on track to slightly exceed the upper end of this target by year end, the final year of this 4-year program. With regards to synergies related to our CCE transaction, we can also reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011. 
as for our share repurchase program, we limited the number of shares purchased this past quarter as we considered strategic alternatives. For those of you who model our business, this will represent approximately $0.01 difference between our earnings per share results and your own models' estimates. On a year-to-date basis, our share repurchase now stands at $1.1 billion, although some of these repurchases have been offset by exercise of employee stock options. At this time, we are planning to purchase at least 2.5 billion in shares this year and plan to accelerate our share repurchase average is needed to achieve this target by year end. 
Now let me add a few notes regarding several other line items. First for the full year, we expect net interest income up $30 million to $40 million. This full year forecast implies a lower level of net interest income for the remaining 2 quarters of this year, driven by our expectation for slightly higher interest rates on our debt in the downhill and the effect of other debt activities we're evaluating, including the conversion of some of our commercial paper balances to long-term debt.  Lastly, our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%. 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume revenue profit and earnings results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to drive our 2020 Vision and advance our global momentum.

So many of your key bottlers around the world right now are cast rich. They're looking to deploy cash for growth. Can you speak to how you're gauge and maximize opportunity?

Let me just say that you heard me say that we're looking at investing $25 billion with our bottling partners in the next 5 years. As I said on CNBC this morning too, the fact that we are generating a good quarter now is not only a result of the great execution and the focus on -- of the laser focus on the priorities and executing against those priorities and the strategies. It's about the investments that we made 6, 7, 8 quarters ago and that we continue to make both in our brands, in innovation capabilities, in distribution capabilities, in aftermarket, in equipment and in enlarging the production base. When you look at the base that we have in a country like China today and generating the kind of growth we're generating on that base, you need significant infrastructure investments in a market just to deliver that kind of volume incrementally on top of the huge base. And that holds true for Africa. That holds true for Latin America, all of the higher gross markets. So we are in Turkey. We are investing very heavily with our bottling partners in Asia and Latin America, in Africa, in Eurasia. And I think the testament, that litmus test again for the health of our business and for our bottlers' appetite for additional investments with us, as well as of course appetite for additional territory. And we have both, and that's a very good sign in our business. But primarily, our bottling partners are seeing with us tremendous opportunities for continued growth. That growth cannot come without conviction, belief, followed by investment that generates and then well executed that generates the growth that we're getting. So I think today, the investments that we're making in this -- that we made in this past quarter, while we delivered a good quarter, are going to pay us off -- pay off in the coming quarters. So that's the way you need to think about it. And then secondly on Japan, look, I think our Japanese bottling partners have been very quick to come together and investing and ensuring that we have -- we are supplying the market ahead of the consumer demand, ahead of the customers' expectations. And that's what we've been doing very successfully Japan, rationalizing SKUs, which we have done in order to ensure that we can navigate through the current restrictions in energy and other areas that the country is going through. And we're playing our part just like also some innovative mechanisms to save more energy on our cooler base, cold drink base in Japan that we've done and implemented successfully and received also great words of support from the government, local and federal in Japan. But look, we're cycling, we're gonna be -- we're cycling a quarter like coming quarter of 11%, due to the very, very unusually hot climatic conditions that existed there in Q3 next year -- last year. And so as we look forward into H2, second half of the year, we see a very challenging cycle, but also ongoing issues around energy, around opening hours for retailers and the like. But look, over time, we see all of this being normalized. And the good news is that we are ahead of where we thought we would be today when we talked to you 3, 4 months ago. And that's I think the key message about our Japanese business that you need to take away. And I think as we did with the global macroeconomic crisis, we haven't wasted the current crisis in Japan. We've used it to become stronger, to become -- to invest further and to ensure that our brands also are very healthy and successful. And again, the $250 million investment, system investment by our bottling partners in Japan, is another great testament to that. So that's what I would like to leave you with."

I think that is the great -- we're looking increasingly at the health of the business through increased transactions and also profitable growth and to continue building both brand equity with our consumers. So as 1 of the only 2 multicategory beverage players in China, the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter. And clearly, I think with the consumer fundamentals and our strong position in China, we're just getting started, I believe, in this region. And we're investing for the long term. And we're ahead of our investments that's announced over $2 billion over the 3-year period starting with 2009 through 2011. And the key strategies and initiatives are to expand our portfolio and packaging, invest -- continue to invest in our distribution system and to invest aggressively in cold drink. You asked about cold drink. This year probably we'll be placing cold drink equipment than we have ever done in our history, for sure. And we are getting growth increasingly in Tier 3 but also continue to grow our business vertically, as well as horizontally growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2. And important to note also brand Coca-Cola was up 24% in the past quarter in China, and we're excited with that, with the focus paying off as well as with the packaging strategy paying off and our strategy of improving enhancing consumer experience paying off in China."

And then the second piece would, could you give us an update in terms of and it sort of follows on with some of Bill's comments about the single-serve in China, as you look at this progression to transactions over the next 12 months or so, how should we be modeling this out? Is it going to be something where the price mix will get a lot better at the volume will go down, just so we can manage expectations there? Or volume estimates will go down but then the profitability should get a little bit better there? So can you walk us through how we should think about that longer term?"

And that is fundamental to the health of our business overall and our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. And think of it as a soft landing. This is not about taking, going down path and altitude and creating indigestion and headaches for people in the plane. It's all about ensuring that we can fine-tune our business, and consumer-led pricing is the key and choice is the key. And portion packs are working very well for us across wherever we've introduced them selectively and with surgical focus, whether it's in the United States, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or China. And I think, a great again indicator of health of our business is growth of transactions. And where volume growth and where transactions do not grow at the same rate, business needs to be fine-tuned. We have that philosophy and we implement that philosophy without -- with ensuring that we always have soft landings. And that's it's a mix of happiness when you have -- when you're able to increase transactions as well as increase your volume and also your share. And that's the position we'd like to see ourselves in every market, and that's what I'd like to just leave you with. And as far as you asked about where do we see this in terms of China, I think the issue, the picture success there again is to keep growing the volume, but also ensuring that we can generate commensurate growth in transactions, without disrupting the business as we implement this strategy and this -- execute with focus. And over to Gary now for your other question."

What I can tell you though is particularly on some of the commodities, let's say corn, we have very favorable hedge contracts in place today for 2011. And that's included in the calculation of the $700 million, so don't expect to see anything like $700 million next year. But we will be then cycling, in certain of those commodities, some favorable hedge positions that we have this year. But with all that said, I'd say there's going to be some commodity pressure next year. It's not going to be anything like, based on what we know today, like it is this year. And I'm talking more U.S. now, because obviously because all of these are dollar-based commodities on international side, a lot of that then gets offset by currency, the way currencies have been moving recently.

It's really -- there are 2 main ingredients that go into making the plastic itself. There is a real supply-demand relative to those 2 ingredients and there's a global shortage of one of those. By the way, that -- this is more than you probably want to know. But a lot of that relates to the price of cotton, of all things, because the price of cotton, as you know, this past year has been kind of historic highs. What that means is that in clothing, a lot of the clothing will start around polyester versus cotton. That puts the demand side on polyester comes from the same source as PET, and that's what's given a lot of the pressure this year to PET resin. I think there will be some pressure on it, but I don't see a lot more upward pressure in the next year at this point. I guess the one thing I would say as well, I think that's where it's really important, not only from an environmental and a consumer point of view, our PlantBottle, which our PlantBottle, 30% of the ingredient now coming from renewable sources from plants versus petroleum. And as we go forward, I think and looking at increasing capacity in that, we can continue to increase our packaging of the PlantBottle globally. That can help us not only environmentally but also on the commodity costs side. So this is one of those where you can do good and do better because of both consumer and costs."

As I said before, Europe is not as uniform as say, Japan or the United States, in terms of the economy recovery. There are regions of Europe that really are not doing badly at all. Germany is one. The exports are still booming out of Germany. German economic growth is leading the rest of the countries in Europe. Great Britain is sort of pretty much in the middle. And then you've got the sort of Eastern Europe coming back, although not coming back very strongly. But there are signs of Eastern Europe central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, then also Romania and Bulgaria and formerly Yugoslavia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, all those places coming back and we expect that to continue, Poland as well. But the real issue still continues to be in terms of consumer confusion and lots of miss, and consumers are being extremely cautious in the southern part and Spain, Italy also, Greece, Spain being Spain and Portugal. But we were pleased to see that Spain grew this past quarter. And we see the programs that were put into place with our bottlers' investments in our brands paying off. And we do believe that we're going to strive to continue growing in Europe on the back of these 4 consecutive quarters. France, of course, is a great performance. We've had, cycling 8%, growing 8%. Germany, again cycling growth and growing, and Great Britain more moderate growth, and then Spain up in the mid-single digits, so we're very positive about that. And then Philippines, Christine, obviously very, very challenging environment in the Philippines with the after-effects of food inflation still lingering on. There's a lot of money that came into the Philippines economy about 4 quarters ago, back during the election, and I think we're cycling that period. But the good news is that we're doing the right things in the Philippines, investing in our brands, gaining market share in the Philippines in both sparkling and still beverages and getting stronger in the Philippines. And therefore, when the current environment stabilizes, and we do believe that we're going to come out of the tunnel stronger and better in the Philippines, where our penetration is growing in all different socioeconomic retail outlets, as well as driving volume and value share and brand health getting better for both Coca-Cola as well as our allied brands, Sprite and Fanta, but also for our still beverages brands."

Now concerning juices in the United States, I signaled in my script, we led pricing with Simply 6% to 9%. Certainly the commodity of pricing for fruit was a challenge going forward. We put that behind us, and we still generated growth in our Simply brand. And we believe that we have the right propositions in juice going forward in the United States. And that we will continue to drive profitable growth in our juice business, both at the higher end with Simply and, but also at the more mid-range, with all the innovations that are taking place with Minute Maid that we're in the marketplace with."

The second, I think, play is that in the U.S. business, we talked to you about 1% to 2% price increase in sort of the first quarter. I think it's fair to say that we have taken actions in the marketplace. And we just have to now turn, go through it and implement it effectively in the second half. But we have taken measures for another 3% to 4% price increase, generating probably a rate increase of overall for the full year of 2% to 3%. And I think anything on price mix will come on top of that. That's where we are in the U.S. business. And I think you will see us, you'll see that being reflected in the marketplace.

26642,133558276,142541,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive",2340,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive quarter we've either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. We're winning in the marketplace, leveraging our strong brands, coupled with the strong solid execution to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We're winning with our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio, led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew at solid 4% in the quarter. 
We're winning with our Global Still Beverage portfolio, which was up 7% for the quarter and up 9% year-to-date, and we are achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a testament to our strong brands and solid business fundamentals. 
Before I review our quarterly operating results in more detail, let me take a moment to share some further thoughts on today's mixed global economic landscape. The economic recovery is weak here in the United States as well as in Europe, Japan and across most of the developed western world. Many middle-class consumers, especially those in developed economies, are still feeling somewhat confused and fragile. At the same time, however, many emerging markets are doing quite well, especially those in Latin America, Eurasia, key countries like India, China and other fast-growing regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. 
With this as a backdrop, our focus is on maintaining a long-term vision of where the world is headed and, in turn, where The Coca-Cola Company wants to go. For us, that road map for winning is represented by our 2020 Vision, a vision shaped together with our global bottling partners and a vision we are confident is ushering in a new era of winning, as we continue along the path to 2020. We estimate that by decade's end, there will be 1 billion new consumers entering into the middle class. 
Additionally, massive urbanization will take place over the next 10 years, with another 800 million or so consumers moving to cities. These consumers are going to generate an increased demand for ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages, which is our business. 
Yet with the vision, you also need a conviction and belief, followed by investment. To that end, we're investing for growth all around the world in alignment with our global bottling partners. We're investing in highly developed markets, such as North America, where we are both investing to support our brands via marketing as well as building new facilities, renewing existing facilities and upgrading our selling and execution capabilities. 
In total, our system has made commitments to invest more than $25 billion over the next 5 years in markets all across the world. Our management's focus and our system-wide investments are paying off today, as we execute our 2020 Vision from a position of real strength.
Turning now to our total company performance. We realized strong worldwide volume growth of 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our volume grew 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, ahead of our long-term growth target, with over 30% of this quarter's incremental growth generated in our BRIC markets.
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9% at the high end of our long-term growth target.
Now let's briefly review performance result across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 4% this quarter, with organic volume even versus prior years, cycling 2% organic growth from prior year. Importantly, North America gained both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, reaffirming our commitment to driving balanced growth.  
Our investments in sparkling beverages in North America continue paying dividends, as we gained volume and value share in the Sparkling category this quarter. Coke Zero delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 21st consecutive quarter, while Fanta was up high single digits in the quarter, building on its year-long positive momentum. We're also expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. We're in 50 U.S. markets today, putting us well on track to meet our target to be in 80 markets by year end. 
As far as still beverages in North America, we delivered positive growth and gain share for the fifth consecutive quarter. A leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth and gained both volume and value share in the Sports Drink category this quarter. Our Energy portfolio saw double-digit volume growth in the quarter with our NOS Energy brand, up a strong 13%. Our key portfolio delivered mid-single-digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit volume increase for our Gold Peak brand, and our Simply brand delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive growth while also taking industry-leading pricing of 6% to 9%, offsetting commodity pressure.
We're making excellent progress with our ongoing integration at Coca-Cola Refreshments, which is proceeding as planned and has enabled strong execution of integrated marketing and commercial programs. So as a result, we remain confident that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place for North America, as we continue to be excited about the outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are investing for growth across our markets. Overall, the Pacific Group volume was up 7% in the quarter, led by double-digit volume growth in China, up 21%, and South Korea, up 16%. Importantly, we gained both volume and value share in the Sparkling category with trademark Coca-Cola, up 4% in the Pacific Group for the quarter. In China, trademark Coca-Cola grew 23% this past quarter, its strongest growth since the second quarter of 2004. And in total, our year-to-date sales in China are now over 1 billion unit cases. Just to put this in context, our China business first delivered 1 billion unit cases for a full year in 2006, which means we doubled the size of our China business in just 5 years. 
Looking ahead and as we have noted in previous earnings calls, we're introducing a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio in China. This is in line with our efforts to focus more on enhancing the consumer experience with our brand and promoting, at the same time, affordability. While this greater emphasis on single-serve packages may lead to some quarter-to-quarter volume fluctuation in the near term, it's also going to drive increased transactions and build brand equity. As such, we're confident we have the right strategies, execution plans as well as capabilities in place in China today to deliver sustainable double-digit growth. 
Japan also delivered positive volume growth, up 1%, for the quarter despite the ongoing aftereffects of the tragic national disaster in March. This is a better result than we expected when we spoke to you about our Japan business in our last earnings call and is a testament to the strength as well as resilience of our Japanese bottling system. Having said that, we do expect to experience continued challenges in our Japan business during the balance of this year, as we cycle last year's record hot summer conditions and keep working through what is still a difficult environment. Gary is going to provide a more detailed update our business in Japan later in our call.
But looking beyond 2011, we have strong confidence in our business in Japan. This year alone, our great Japanese bottling system has announced investments totaling over $250 million for production capacity improvements, logistics facilities and equipment innovations.
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to generate volume and profit growth across the region, with volume up 6% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. We were able to capture this growth through a relentless focus on occasion-based consumer segmentation, combined with best-in-class customer service capabilities. These strategies which have served us so well in Latin America and many other markets around the world are the same ones, actually, we're now actively implementing in North America. 
Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up double digits for the quarter for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 7% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. An interesting data point regarding Mexico this quarter is that our bottling partner, Coca-Cola FEMSA, sold 125 million unit cases in the month of May alone, the largest monthly sales volume in their history. This historic milestone occurred in the same month that we were celebrating Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary is more than just a coincidence. It's a great testament to the remarkable system partnership we have in place in Mexico today. 
Brazil volume was up 1% for the quarter, cycling double-digit growth and reflecting the macroeconomic slowdown, driven by the government's recent efforts to curb inflation. It's important to note that our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, gaining both volume and value share in both sparkling, as well as still beverages. This provides us confidence that our strategies are working in Brazil and that we're well-positioned to expand our share of industry growth in the years ahead. And our Argentina business delivered high single-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages.
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, where we are executing with excellence across a diverse geography. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, led by strong results in Turkey, Russia and India. Turkey was up 12% this quarter with brand Coca-Cola up 5% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Russia was up 9% this quarter and 16% year-to-date, led by brand Coca-Cola up 17% this past quarter, posting a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
India delivered quality results, growing 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, making this the 20th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this key emerging market. Growth in India was balanced across our portfolio, with both sparkling and still beverages up 8% each. 
Despite geopolitical challenges, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 8% growth as we invest to strengthen our position in this region. We are also investing to enhance our competitive advantage across fast-growing countries in Sub-Sahara Africa. Our business in this region was up 6% this quarter, and we believe the opportunity for growth there is significant. GDP forecast for the next 5 years indicate that of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, 7 will be located in Sub-Sahara Africa, making this region, in our view, of exciting S in BRICS. 
As we move to Europe, the headline here is one of accelerated growth despite a challenging environment, macroeconomic environment. Volume was up 5%, marking Europe's fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, every region of our European business delivered positive growth this past quarter, benefiting from warmer weather, as well as excellent in-market activation of our 125th anniversary programs. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with trademark Coca-Cola up 6%. And Coca-Cola Zero was up double digits for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our still beverages were also up 5% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in energy beverages and high single-digit growth in teas. Additionally, the further expansion of the Innocent brand fueled our juice and juice drink growth. 
While every region of our European business delivered volume growth this quarter, Germany led the way with 7%. Our German business benefited from the further evolution of our occasion-based package and price architecture and the successful execution of robust marketing programs centered on our 125th anniversary campaign. Our new marketing programs are also helping us recruit both lapsed [ph] consumers as well as a new generation of teens in this key European market. 
As many of you know, our 2020 Vision outlines this strategic set of priorities across multiple dimensions. From time-to-time, we will take an opportunity in our earnings calls to highlight these priorities and share how we are advancing them. One of our priorities is to win at the point of sale by expanding our investments in immediate consumption. Year-to-date, we're seeing strong momentum against this priority with our immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. And while many still beverages categories contributed to this growth, our Immediate Consumption Sparkling Beverages are up 4% year-to-date. Importantly, each geographic operating group is growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. As the world becomes more urbanized and as more consumers begin to lead on-the-go mobile lifestyles, we see great runway ahead for us and profitable immediate consumption growth. 
In closing, we're working closely together with our global bottling partners. And the strength of our alignment not only enables us to navigate the current economic and consumer landscape, it also puts us in a position of real strength to deliver our 2020 Vision. Despite the mixed economic recovery all around the globe, consumers are increasingly choosing our brands to refresh themselves at a rate of over 1.7 billion servings every day and growing. Our strong revenue and profit results, combined with our worldwide volume and value share gains and positive price mix, attest to the strength of our global system. 
During this past quarter, we officially celebrated Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary. And while it is wonderfully rewarding to celebrate our past, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future. With our 2020 Vision as our road map, we will continue to execute our strategies with more focus and passion than ever before. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,133558276,142541,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we're achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. As Muhtar said, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.17 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. This brings our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9%, at the high end of our long-term growth target.  
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 18%. This includes a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This brings our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 14%, including a 4% currency benefit and the commodity headwinds. 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 47% this quarter, including a 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 6% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth was 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, a 4% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined International and Bottling Investments Group price mix was a positive 2% this quarter, and our second quarter pricing to retailers in North America was up between 1% and 2%. To be clear, this is our best estimate of the increased pricing our retail customers pay for our brands. 
In our meetings with you this past quarter, some of the you asked for additional detail regarding our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy. We believe in executing pricing within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases, together with occasion-based package mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and retail pricing growth. So let me update you on the rest-of-year outlook with respect to our North America retail pricing strategy. 
As we said in our last earnings call, we expect to capture between 3% and 4% incremental retail pricing in the back half of 2011, leading to a net full-year benefit of between 2% and 3%. We can confirm that we have put into effect incremental pricing programs with many of our customers for the rest of this year that will enable us to deliver against this full-year retail pricing target. As such, our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy is laser-focused on driving profitable growth, leveraging both rate and mix levers and to not just take price, but to earn retail price ahead of inflation and at a premium to our industry. 
Our system has done this successfully and consistently in North America, not just this quarter and not just this year, but on a sustainable year-over-year basis. And I can assure you that we will continue to execute our retail pricing strategies to deliver maximum long-term value, not only to our consumers and our customers, but especially our shareowners.
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 47% in the quarter and 48% year-to-date. As we did last quarter, I'll take a moment to review our consolidated SG&A results by operating segment to provide you with a little more context and insight on our results. 
First and as expected, North America's SG&A reflects an increase due to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, including the application of The Coca-Cola Company's sales curve accounting policy to the related CCE North America marketing expenses, as I detailed in our last earnings call. We expect this increase and its corresponding impact on operating expense leverage to remain in place until we fully cycle acquisition of CCE's North American business. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items for both the quarter and year-to-date. This is also to be expected as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets where we see strong long-term growth potential. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A reflects increased direct marketing expenses, as we further invest in the health and strength of our brands. And finally, as expected, our currency-neutral corporate expenses are up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date due to the inclusion of corporate expenses related to CCE's North American operations and other investments, primarily in IT. While we consider these collective SG&A increases and the higher commodity costs observed this year, we expect the full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investment Group as anticipated, since both are finished goods businesses.  As for our international operations, we expect our operating expense leverage to be even for the full year, as we strategically sustain our brand-building investments around the world. 
And for our year-to-date cash flow from operation, this came in at $3.6 billion or $668 million less than in the comparable period last year. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, a business which is historically a net user of cash in the first half of the year. In addition, this cash flow results include a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year, as discussed in our last earnings call. Net of the pension plan contributions, cash flow from operations were actually up 2% year-to-date. 
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook, starting with how we are successfully managing the current currency and commodity environment, as both of these items have tended to move in opposite directions this year, serving to partially offset each other's impact. Since our last earnings call in April of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate. In response, we have increased our coverage of most key currencies for the remainder of the year and now expect currencies to have a mid-single-digit positive impact on operating income for the full year. 
As for commodities, we still expect these to have an unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million on our full year results, in line with the same full year forecast we shared last quarter. As communicated earlier, we are implementing retail price increases with our customers who are also pulling forward cost-saving initiatives to help offset some of these commodity cost. 
We continue to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. We also continue to reflect the impact of gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting in the period that the underlying transaction takes place. As a result, in this quarter, we recognized a net $26 million of previously deferred gains primarily related to commodity hedging and have called these out in the schedules and notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules. 
Now let me share our latest views on how we see our recent events in Japan influencing our full year results. As Muhtar mentioned, our second quarter results in Japan came in stronger than anticipated after the earthquake and tsunami. Having said that and consistent with what we shared in our last earnings call, we still expect events in Japan to dilute our full year comparable earnings per share by between $0.03 and $0.05, with this impact primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, let me update you on our efforts across several of our ongoing programs starting with our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008. Our original plan, you may remember, target to capture $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Today, I can confirm that we are on track to slightly exceed the upper end of this target by year end, the final year of this 4-year program. With regard to synergies related to our CCE transaction, we can also reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011. 
As for our share repurchase program, we limited the number of shares purchased this past quarter, as we considered strategic alternatives. For those of you who model our business, this will represent approximately $0.01 difference between our earnings per share results in your old model's estimates. On a year-to-date basis, our share repurchase now stands at $1.1 billion, although some of these repurchases have been offset by the exercise of employee stock options. At this time, we are planning to purchase at least 2.5 billion in shares this year and plan to accelerate our share repurchase efforts, as needed, to achieve this target by year end. 
Now let me add a few notes regarding several other line items. First for the full year, we expect net interest income, up $30 million to $40 million. This full year forecast implies a lower level of net interest income for the remaining 2 quarters of this year, driven by our expectation for slightly higher interest rates on our debt in the downhill and the effect of other debt activities we're evaluating, including the conversion of some of our commercial paper balances to long-term debt. Lastly, our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%. 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to drive our 2020 Vision and advance our global momentum.

So many of your key bottlers around the world right now are cash-rich. They're looking to deploy cash for growth. Can you speak to how you gauge and maximize this opportunity?

Let me just say that you heard me say that we're looking at investing $25 billion with our bottling partners over the next 5 years. As I said on CNBC this morning, too, the fact that we are generating a good quarter now is not only a result of the good execution and the focus on, the laser focus on the priorities and executing against those priorities and the strategies. It's about the investments that we made 6, 7, 8 quarters ago and that we continue to make both in our brands, in innovation capabilities, in distribution capabilities, in aftermarket, in equipment and in enlarging the production base. When you look at the base that we have in a country like China today and generating the kind of growth we are generating on that base, you need significant infrastructure investments in a market just to deliver that kind of volume incrementally on top of the huge base. And that holds true for Africa, that holds true for Latin America, all of the higher gross markets. So we are in Turkey. We're investing very heavily with our bottling partners in Asia and Latin America, in Africa, in Eurasia. And I think the testament, the best litmus test again for the health of our business is, our bottlers' appetite for additional investments with us, as well as of course, appetite for additional territory. And we have both, and that's a very good sign in our business. But primarily, our bottling partners are seeing with us tremendous opportunities for continued growth. That growth cannot come without conviction, belief, followed by investment that generates and then well-executed that generates the growth that we're getting. So I think today, the investments that we're making in this -- that we made in this past quarter, while we delivered a good quarter, are going to pay off in the coming quarters. So that's the way you need to think about it. And then secondly, on Japan, look, I think our Japanese bottling partners have been very quick to come together and investing and ensuring that we have -- we-are supplying the market ahead of the trends, ahead of the consumer demand, ahead of the customers' expectations. And that's what we have been doing very successfully in Japan, rationalizing SKUs, which we have done in order to ensure that we can navigate through the current restrictions in energy and other areas that the country is going through. And we're playing our part just like also some innovative mechanisms to save more energy on our cooler base, cold drink base in Japan that we've done and implemented successfully and have received also great words of support from the government, local and federal in Japan. But look, we're cycling a quarter like a coming quarter of 11%, due to the very, very unusually hot climatic conditions that existed there in Q3 next year -- last year. And so, as we look forward into H2, the second half of the year, we see a very challenging cycle, but also ongoing issues around energy, around opening hours for retailers and the like. But look, over time, we see all of this being normalized, and the good news is that we are ahead of where we thought we would be today when we talked to you 3 or 4 months ago. And that, I think, the key message about our Japanese business that you need to take away. And I think, as we did with the global macroeconomic crisis, we haven't wasted the current crisis in Japan. We've used it to become stronger, to become -- to invest further and to ensure that our brands also are very healthy and successful. And again, the $250 million investment, system investment by our bottling partners in Japan, is another great testament to that. So that's what I would like to leave you with."

So as 1 of the only 2 multicategory beverage players in China, the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter. And clearly, I think with the consumer fundamentals and our strong position in China, we're just getting started, I believe, in this region. And we're investing for the long term. And we're ahead of our investment of announced of $2 billion over the 3-year period starting with 2009 through 2011. And the key strategies and initiatives are to expand our portfolio and packaging, continue to invest in our distribution system and to invest aggressively in Cold Drink. You asked about Cold Drink. This year, probably, we'll be placing cold drink equipment than we've ever done in our history, for sure. And then, we are getting growth increasingly in Tier 3, but also continue to grow our business vertically, as well as slightly horizontal growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2. And important to note, also, brand Coca-Cola was up 24% in the past quarter in China, and we're excited with the focus paying off, as well as with the packaging strategy paying off, and our strategy of improving, enhancing consumer experience paying off in China."

And that is fundamental to the health of our business, overall, and our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth, and think of it as a soft landing. This is not about taking, going down path and altitude, and creating indigestion and headaches for people in the plane. It's all about ensuring that we can fine-tune our business, and consumer-led pricing is the key and choice is the key. And portion packs are working very well for us across wherever we've introduced them selectively and with surgical focus, whether it's in the United States, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or China. And I think, a great, again, indicator of health of our business is growth of transactions. And where volume grows and where transactions do not grow at the same rate, business needs to be fine-tuned. We have that philosophy and we implement that philosophy without -- with ensuring that we always have soft landings. And that's a mix of happiness when you have -- when you're able to increase transactions as well as increase your volume and also your share. And that's the position we'd like to see ourselves in every market, and that's what I'd like to just leave you with. And as far as you asked about where do we see this in terms of China, I think the issue, the picture success there again is to keep growing the volume, but also ensuring that we can generate commensurate growth in transactions, without disrupting the business, as we implement this strategy and this -- execute with focus. And over to Gary now for your other question."

What I can tell you though is particularly on some of the commodities, let's say corn, we have very favorable hedge contracts in place today for 2011. And that's included in the calculation of the $700 million. So don't expect to see anything like $700 million next year. But we will be then cycling in certain of those commodities, some favorable hedge positions that we have this year.

And I'm talking more U.S. now, because obviously, if all of these are dollar-based commodities on the international side, a lot of that then gets offset by currency, the way currencies have been moving recently.

It's really -- there are 2 main ingredients that go into making the plastic itself. There is a real supply-demand relative to those 2 ingredients and there's a global shortage of one of those. By the way, that -- this is more than you probably want to know. But a lot of that relates to the price of cotton, of all things, because the price of cotton, as you know, this past year has been kind of historic highs. What that means is that in clothing, a lot of the clothing will start going toward polyester versus cotton. That puts the demand side on polyester comes from the same source as PET, and that's what's given a lot of the pressure this year to PET resin. I think there will be some pressure on it, but I don't see a lot more upward pressure in the next year at this point. I guess the one thing I would say as well, I think that's where it's really important, not only from an environmental and a consumer point of view, our PlantBottle, which our PlantBottle, 30% of the ingredient now coming from renewable sources from plants versus petroleum. And as we go forward, I think and looking at increasing capacity in that, we can continue to increase our packaging of the PlantBottle globally. That can help us not only environmentally, but also on the commodity costs side. So this is one of those where you can do good and do better because of both consumer and costs."

I think Europe, we're obviously pleased with the result, given the macro conditions in Europe, overall. As I said before, Europe is not as uniform as, say, Japan or the United States in terms of the economy recovery. There are regions of Europe that really are not doing badly at all. Germany is one. The exports are still booming out of Germany. The German economic growth is leading the rest of the countries in Europe. The Great Britain is sort of pretty much in the middle, and then you've got the sort of Eastern Europe coming back, although not coming back very strongly. But there are signs of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, then also Romania and Bulgaria and former Yugoslavia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, all of those places coming back and we expect that to continue, Poland as well. But the real issue still continues to be in terms of consumer confusion and lots of missed, and consumers are being extremely cautious in the southern part in Spain, Italy also, Greece, Spain, being Spain and Portugal. But we were pleased to see that Spain grew this past quarter, and we see the programs that we're putting into place with our bottlers' investments in our brands, paying off. And we do believe that we're going to strive to continue growing in Europe on the back of these 4 consecutive quarters. France, of course, is a great performance. We've had cycling 8%, growing 8%. Germany, again, cycling growth and growing, and Great Britain more moderate growth, and then Spain up in the mid-single digits. So we're very positive about that. And then Philippines, Christine, obviously very, very challenging environment in the Philippines, with the aftereffects of food inflation still lingering on. There's a lot of hot money that came into the Philippines' economy back about 4 quarters ago, back during the election, and I think we're cycling that period. But the good news is that we're doing the right things in the Philippines, investing in our brands, gaining market share in the Philippines in both sparkling and still beverages, and getting stronger in the Philippines. And therefore, when the current environment stabilizes, and we do believe that we're going to come out of the tunnel stronger and better in the Philippines, where our penetration is growing in all different socioeconomic retail outlets, as well as driving volume and value share and brand health getting better for both Coca-Cola as well as our allied brands, Sprite and Fanta, but also for our still beverages brands."

We put that behind us, and we still generated growth in our Simply brand.

The second, I think, point is that in the U.S. business, we talked to you about 1% to 2% price increase in sort of the first quarter. I think it's fair to say that we have taken actions in the marketplace. And we just have to now turn, go through it and implement it effectively in the second half. But we have taken measures for another 3% to 4% price increase generating probably a rate increase of, overall, for the full year of 2% to 3%.

And what I'm saying is that we are free to reenter the market on both accounts as of today."

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive",2343,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive quarter we've either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. We're winning in the marketplace, leveraging our strong brands, coupled with strong solid execution to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We're winning with our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio, led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a solid 4% in the quarter. 
We're winning with our Global Still Beverage portfolio, which was up 7% for the quarter and up 9% year-to-date, and we are achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a testament to our strong brands and solid business fundamentals. 
Before I review our quarterly operating results in more detail, let me take a moment to share some further thoughts on today's mixed global economic landscape. The economic recovery is weak here in the United States as well as in Europe, Japan and across most of the developed western world. Many middle-class consumers, especially those in developed economies, are still feeling somewhat confused and fragile. At the same time, however, many emerging markets are doing quite well, especially those in Latin America, Eurasia, key countries like India, China and other fast-growing regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. 
With this as a backdrop, our focus is on maintaining a long-term vision of where the world is headed and, in turn, where The Coca-Cola Company wants to go. For us, that road map for winning is represented by our 2020 Vision, a vision shaped together with our global bottling partners and a vision we are confident is ushering in a new era of winning, as we continue along the path to 2020. We estimate that by decade's end, there will be 1 billion new consumers entering into the middle class. 
Additionally, massive urbanization will take place over the next 10 years, with another 800 million or so consumers moving to cities. These consumers are going to generate an increased demand for ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages, which is our business. 
Yet with a vision, you also need a conviction and belief, followed by investment. To that end, we're investing for growth all around the world in alignment with our global bottling partners. We're investing in highly developed markets, such as North America, where we are both investing to support our brands via marketing as well as building new facilities, renewing existing facilities and upgrading our selling and execution capabilities. 
In total, our system has made commitments to invest more than $25 billion over the next 5 years in markets all across the world. Our management's focus and our system-wide investments are paying off today, as we execute our 2020 Vision from a position of real strength.
Turning now to our total company performance. We realized strong worldwide volume growth of 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our volume grew 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, ahead of our long-term growth target, with over 30% of this quarter's incremental growth generated in our BRIC markets.
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9% at the high end of our long-term growth target.
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 4% this quarter, with organic volume even versus prior years, cycling 2% organic growth from prior year. Importantly, North America gained both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, reaffirming our commitment to driving balanced growth.  
Our investments in sparkling beverages in North America continued paying dividends, as we gained volume and value share in the Sparkling category this quarter. Coke Zero delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 21st consecutive quarter, while Fanta was up high-single digits in the quarter, building on its year-long positive momentum. We're also expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. We're in 50 U.S. markets today, putting us well on track to meet our target to be in 80 markets by year end. 
As far as still beverages in North America, we delivered positive growth and gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter. A leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth and gained both volume and value share in the Sports Drink category this quarter. Our Energy portfolio saw double-digit volume growth in the quarter with our NOS Energy brand up a strong 13%. Our key portfolio delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit volume increase for our Gold Peak brand, and our Simply brand delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive growth while also taking industry-leading pricing of 6% to 9%, offsetting commodity pressure.
And we're making excellent progress with our ongoing integration at Coca-Cola Refreshments, which is proceeding as planned and has enabled strong execution of integrated marketing and commercial programs. So as a result, we remain confident that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place for North America, as we continue to be excited about the outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are investing for growth across our markets. Overall, the Pacific Group volume was up 7% in the quarter, led by double-digit volume growth in China, up 21%, and South Korea, up 16%. Importantly, we gained both volume and value share in the Sparkling category with trademark Coca-Cola, up 4% in the Pacific Group for the quarter. In China, trademark Coca-Cola grew 23% this past quarter, its strongest growth since the second quarter of 2004. And in total, our year-to-date sales in China are now over 1 billion unit cases. Just to put this in context, our China business first delivered 1 billion unit cases for a full year in 2006, which means we doubled the size of our China business in just 5 years. 
Looking ahead and as we have noted in previous earnings calls, we're introducing a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio in China. This is in line with our efforts to focus more on enhancing the consumer experience with our brand and promoting, at the same time, affordability. While this greater emphasis on single-serve packages may lead to some quarter-to-quarter volume fluctuation in the near term, it's also going to drive increased transactions and build brand equity. As such, we're confident we have the right strategies, execution plans as well as capabilities in place in China today to deliver sustainable double-digit growth. 
Japan also delivered positive volume growth, up 1%, for the quarter despite the ongoing aftereffects of the tragic national disaster in March. This is a better result than we expected when we spoke to you about our Japan business in our last earnings call and is a testament to the strength as well as resilience of our Japanese bottling system. Having said that, we do expect to experience continued challenges in our Japan business during the balance of this year, as we cycle last year's record hot summer conditions and keep working through what is still a difficult environment. Gary is going to provide a more detailed update on our business in Japan later in our call.
But looking beyond 2011, we have strong confidence in our business in Japan. This year alone, our great Japanese bottling system have announced investments totaling over $250 million for production capacity improvements, logistics facilities and equipment innovations.
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to generate volume and profit growth across the region, with volume up 6% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. We were able to capture this growth through a relentless focus on occasion-based consumer segmentation, combined with best-in-class customer service capabilities. These strategies which have served us so well in Latin America and many other markets around the world are the same ones, actually, we're now actively implementing in North America. 
Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up double digits for the quarter for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 7% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. An interesting data point regarding Mexico this quarter is that our bottling partner, Coca-Cola FEMSA, sold 125 million unit cases in the month of May alone, the largest monthly sales volume in their history. That this historic milestone occurred in the same month that we were celebrating Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary is more than just a coincidence. It's a great testament to the remarkable system partnership we have in place in Mexico today. 
Brazil volume was up 1% for the quarter, cycling double-digit growth and reflecting the macroeconomic slowdown, driven by the government's recent efforts to curb inflation. It's important to note that our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, gaining both volume and best value share in both sparkling, as well as still beverages. This provides us confidence that our strategies are working in Brazil and that we're well positioned to expand our share of industry growth in the years ahead. And our Argentina business delivered high-single digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages.
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, where we are executing with excellence across a diverse geography. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, led by strong results in Turkey, Russia and India. Turkey was up 12% this quarter with brand Coca-Cola up 5% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Russia was up 9% this quarter and 16% year-to-date, led by brand Coca-Cola up 17% this past quarter, posting a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
India delivered quality results, growing 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, making this the 20th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this key emerging market. Growth in India was balanced across our portfolio, with both sparkling and still beverages up 8% each. 
Despite geopolitical challenges, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 8% growth as we invest to strengthen our position in this region. We are also investing to enhance our competitive advantage across fast-growing countries in Sub-Sahara Africa. Our business in this region was up 6% this quarter, and we believe the opportunity for growth there is significant. GDP forecasts for the next 5 years indicate that of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, 7 will be located in Sub-Sahara Africa, making this region, in our view, the exciting S in BRICS. 
As we move to Europe, the headline here is one of accelerated growth despite a challenging environment, economic environment. Volume was up 5%, marking Europe's fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, every region of our European business delivered positive growth this past quarter, benefiting from warmer weather, as well as excellent in-market activation of our 125th anniversary programs. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with trademark Coca-Cola up 6%. And Coca-Cola Zero was up double digits for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our still beverages were also up 5% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in energy beverages and high-single digit growth in teas. Additionally, the further expansion of the Innocent brand fueled our juice and juice drink growth. 
While every region of our European business delivered volume growth this quarter, Germany led the way with 7%. Our German business benefited from the further evolution of our occasion-based package and price architecture and the successful execution of robust marketing programs centered on our 125th anniversary campaign. Our new marketing programs are also helping us recruit both lapsed consumers as well as a new generation of teens in this key European market. 
As many of you know, our 2020 Vision outlines this strategic set of priorities across multiple dimensions. From time-to-time, we will take an opportunity in our earnings calls to highlight these priorities and share how we are advancing them. One of our priorities is to win at the point of sale by expanding our investments in immediate consumption. Year-to-date, we're seeing strong momentum against this priority with our immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. And while many still beverage categories contributed to this growth, our Immediate Consumption Sparkling Beverages are up 4% year-to-date. Importantly, each geographic operating group is growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. As the world becomes more urbanized and as more consumers begin to lead on-the-go mobile lifestyles, we see great runway ahead for us in profitable Immediate Consumption growth. 
In closing, we're working closely together with our global bottling partners. And the strength of our alignment not only enables us to navigate the current economic and consumer landscape, it also puts us in a position of real strength to deliver our 2020 Vision. Despite the mixed economic recovery all around the globe, consumers are increasingly choosing our brands to refresh themselves at a rate of over 1.7 billion servings every day and growing. Our strong revenue and profit results, combined with our worldwide volume and value share gains and positive price mix, attest to the strength of our global system. 
During this past quarter, we officially celebrated Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary. And while it is wonderfully rewarding to celebrate our past, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future. With our 2020 Vision as our road map, we will continue to execute our strategies with more focus and passion than ever before. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets.

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we're achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. As Muhtar said, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.17 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. This brings our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9%, at the high end of our long-term growth target.  
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 18%. This includes a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This brings our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 14%, including a 4% currency benefit and the commodity headwinds. 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 47% this quarter, including a 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 6% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of a CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth was 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, a 4% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined International and Bottling Investments Group price mix was a positive 2% this quarter, and our second quarter pricing to retailers in North America was up between 1% and 2%. To be clear, this is our best estimate of the increased pricing our retail customers pay for our brands. 
In our meetings with you this past quarter, some of you asked for additional detail regarding our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy. We believe in executing pricing within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases, together with occasion-based package mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and retail pricing growth. So let me update you on the rest-of-year outlook with respect to our North America retail pricing strategy. 
As we said in our last earnings call, we expect to capture between 3% and 4% incremental retail pricing in the back half of 2011, leading to a net full year benefit of between 2% and 3%. We can confirm that we have put into effect incremental pricing programs with many of our customers for the rest of this year that will enable us to deliver against this full year retail pricing target. As such, our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy is laser-focused on driving profitable growth, leveraging both rate and mix levers and to not just take price, but to earn retail price ahead of inflation and at a premium to our industry. 
Our system has done this successfully and consistently in North America, not just this quarter and not just this year, but on a sustainable year-over-year basis. And I can assure you that we will continue to execute our retail pricing strategies to deliver maximum long-term value, not only to our consumers and our customers, but especially our shareowners.
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 47% in the quarter and 48% year-to-date. As we did last quarter, I'll take a moment to review our consolidated SG&A results by operating segment to provide you with a little more context and insight on our results. 
First and as expected, North America's SG&A reflects an increase due to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, including the application of The Coca-Cola Company's sales curve accounting policy to the related CCE North America marketing expenses, as I detailed in our last earnings call. We expect this increase and its corresponding impact on operating expense leverage to remain in place until we fully cycle acquisition of CCE's North American business. 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items for both the quarter and year-to-date. This is also to be expected as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets where we see strong long-term growth potential. 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A reflects increased direct marketing expenses, as we further invest in the health and strength of our brands. And finally, as expected, our currency-neutral corporate expenses are up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date due to the inclusion of corporate expenses related to CCE's North American operations and other investments, primarily in IT. While we consider these collective SG&A increases and the higher commodity costs observed this year, we expect full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investment Group as anticipated, since both are finished goods businesses. As for our international operations, we expect our operating expense leverage to be even for the full year, as we strategically sustain our brand-building investments around the world. 
And for our year-to-date cash flow from operations, this came in at $3.6 billion or $668 million less than in the comparable period last year. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, a business which is historically a net user of cash in the first half of the year. In addition, this cash flow results includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year, as discussed in our last earnings call. Net of the pension plan contributions, cash flow from operations were actually up 2% year-to-date. 
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook, starting with how we are successfully managing the current currency and commodity environment, as both of these items have tended to move in opposite directions this year, serving to partially offset each other's impact. Since our last earnings call in April of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate. In response, we have increased our coverage of most key currencies for the remainder of the year and now expect currencies to have a mid-single digit positive impact on operating income for the full year. 
As for commodities, we still expect these to have an unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million on our full year results, in line with the same full year forecast we shared last quarter. As communicated earlier, we are implementing retail price increases with our customers who are also pulling forward cost-saving initiatives to help offset some of these commodity cost. 
We continue to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. We also continue to reflect the impact of gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting in the period that the underlying transaction takes place. As a result, in this quarter, we recognized a net $26 million of previously deferred gains primarily related to commodity hedging and have called these out in the schedules and notes to our GAAP/non-GAAP schedule. 
Now let me share our latest views on how we see our recent events in Japan influencing our full year results. As Muhtar mentioned, our second quarter results in Japan came in stronger than anticipated after the earthquake and tsunami. Having said that and consistent with what we shared in our last earnings call, we still expect events in Japan to dilute our full year comparable earnings per share by between $0.03 and $0.05, with this impact primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, let me update you on our efforts across several of our ongoing programs starting with our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008. Our original plan, you may remember, target to capture $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Today, I can confirm that we are on track to slightly exceed the upper end of this target by year end, the final year of this 4-year program. With regard to synergies related to our CCE transaction, we can also reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011. 
As for our share repurchase program, we limited the number of shares purchased this past quarter, as we considered strategic alternatives. For those of you who model our business, this will represent approximately $0.01 difference between our earnings per share results and your own model's estimates. On a year-to-date basis, our share repurchase now stands at $1.1 billion, although some of these repurchases have been offset by the exercise of employee stock options. At this time, we are planning to purchase at least 2.5 billion in shares this year and plan to accelerate our share repurchase efforts, as needed, to achieve this target by year end. 
Now let me add a few notes regarding several other line items. First for the full year, we expect net interest income, up $30 million to $40 million. This full year forecast implies a lower level of net interest income for the remaining 2 quarters of this year, driven by our expectation for slightly higher interest rates on our debt in the downhill and the effect of other debt activities we're evaluating, including the conversion of some of our commercial paper balances to long-term debt. Lastly, our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%. 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to drive our 2020 Vision and advance our global momentum.

As I said on CNBC this morning, too, the fact that we are generating a good quarter now",655,"I'll take your second question first. Let me just say that you heard me say that we're looking at investing $25 billion with our bottling partners in the next 5 years. As I said on CNBC this morning, too, the fact that we are generating a good quarter now is not only a result of the good execution and the focus on -- the laser focus on the priorities and executing against those priorities and the strategies. It's about the investments that we made 6, 7, 8 quarters ago and that we continue to make both in our brands, in innovation capabilities, in distribution capabilities, in route-to-market, in equipment and in enlarging the production base. When you look at the base that we have in a country like China today and generating the kind of growth we are generating on that base, you need significant infrastructure investments in a market just to deliver that kind of volume incrementally on top of the huge base. And that holds true for Africa, that holds true for Latin America, all of the higher growth markets. So we are in Turkey. We're investing very heavily with our bottling partners in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, in Eurasia. And I think the testament, the best litmus test again for the health of our business is our bottlers' appetite for additional investments with us as well as, of course, appetite for additional territory. And we have both, and that's a very good sign in our business. But primarily, our bottling partners are seeing with us tremendous opportunities for continued growth. That growth cannot come without conviction, belief, followed by investment that generates -- and then well-executed that generates the growth that we're getting. So I think today, the investments that we're making in this -- that we made in this past quarter, while we delivered a good quarter, are going to pay off in the coming quarters. So that's the way you need to think about it. And then secondly, on Japan, look, I think our Japanese bottling partners have been very quick to come together and investing and ensuring that we have -- we‚Äôre supplying the market ahead of the trends, ahead of the consumer demand, ahead of the customers' expectations. And that's what we have been doing very successfully in Japan, rationalizing SKUs, which we have done in order to ensure that we can navigate through the current restrictions in energy and other areas that the country is going through. And we're playing our part just like also some innovative mechanisms to save more energy on our cooler base, cold drink base in Japan that we've done and implemented successfully and have received also great words of support from the government, local and federal in Japan. But look, we're cycling a quarter, like, coming quarter of 11%, due to the very, very unusually hot climatic conditions that existed there in Q3 next year -- last year. And so, as we look forward into H2, the second half of the year, we see a very challenging cycle, but also ongoing issues around energy, around opening hours for retailers and the like. But look, over time, we see all of this being normalized, and the good news is that we are ahead of where we thought we would be today when we talked to you 3 or 4 months ago. And that‚Äôs, I think, the key message about our Japanese business that you need to take away. And I think, as we did with the global macroeconomic crisis, we haven't wasted the current crisis in Japan. We've used it to become stronger, to become -- to invest further and to ensure that our brands also are very healthy and successful. And again, the $250 million investment, system investment by our bottling partners in Japan, is another great testament to that. So that's what I‚Äôd like to leave you with."

I think that is a great -- we're looking increasingly at the health of the business through increased transactions and also profitable growth and to continue building both brand equity with our consumers. So as 1 of the only 2 multicategory beverage players in China, the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter. And clearly, I think with the consumer fundamentals and our strong position in China, we're just getting started, I believe, in this region. And we're investing for the long term. And we're ahead of our investment announced of $2 billion over the 3-year period starting with 2009 through ‚Äô11. And the key strategies and initiatives are to expand our portfolio and packaging, continue to invest in our distribution system and to invest aggressively in Cold Drink. You asked about Cold Drink. This year, probably, we'll be placing more cold drink equipment than we've ever done in our history, for sure. And then, we are getting growth increasingly in Tier 3, but also continue to grow our business vertically, as well as slightly horizontal growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2. And important to note, also, brand Coca-Cola was up 24% in the past quarter in China, and we're excited with the focus paying off, as well as with the packaging strategy paying off and our strategy of improving, enhancing consumer experience paying off in China."

And that is fundamental to the health of our business, overall, and our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth, and think of it as a soft landing. This is not about taking, going down path and altitude, and creating indigestion and headaches for people in the plane. It's all about ensuring that we can fine-tune our business, and consumer-led pricing is the key and choice is the key. And portion packs are working very well for us across wherever we've introduced them selectively and with surgical focus, whether it's in the United States, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or China. And I think, a great, again, indicator of health of our business is growth of transactions. And where volume grows and transactions do not grow at the same rate, business needs to be fine-tuned. We have that philosophy and we implement that philosophy without -- with ensuring that we always have soft landings. And that it's a mix of happiness when you have -- when you're able to increase transactions as well as increase your volume and also your share. And that's the position we'd like to see ourselves in every market, and that's what I'd like to just leave you with.

It's really -- there are 2 main ingredients that go into making the plastic itself. There is a real supply-demand relative to those 2 ingredients and there's a global shortage of one of those. By the way, that -- this is more than you probably want to know. But a lot of that relates to the price of cotton, of all things, because -- and price of cotton, as you know, this past year has been kind of historic highs. What that means is that in clothing, a lot of the clothing will start going toward polyester versus cotton. That puts the demand side on polyester comes from the same source as PET, and that's what's given a lot of the pressure this year to PET resin. I think there‚Äôll still be some pressure on it, but I don't see a lot more upward pressure into next year at this point. I guess the one thing I would say as well, I think that's where it's really important, not only from an environmental and a consumer point of view, our PlantBottle, which in our PlantBottle, 30% of the ingredient now coming from renewable sources from plants versus petroleum. And as we go forward, I think, and looking at increasing capacity in that, we can continue to increase our packaging of the PlantBottle globally. That can help us not only environmentally, but also on the commodity costs side. So this is one of those where you can do good and do better because of both consumer and costs."

The exports are still booming out of Germany. The German economic growth is leading the rest of the countries in Europe. Great Britain is sort of pretty much in the middle, and then you've got the sort of Eastern Europe coming back, although not coming back very strongly. But there are signs of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, then also Romania and Bulgaria and former Yugoslavia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, all of those places coming back and we expect that to continue, Poland as well. But the real issue still continues to be in terms of consumer confusion and lots of missed, and consumers being extremely cautious in the southern part, in Spain, Italy also, Greece, Spain, being Spain and Portugal. But we were pleased to see that Spain grew this past quarter, and we see the programs that we're putting into place with our bottlers, the investments in our brands, paying off. And we do believe that we're going to strive to continue growing in Europe on the back of these 4 consecutive quarters. France, of course, is a great performance. We've had cycling 8%, growing 8%. Germany, again, cycling growth and growing, and Great Britain more moderate growth, and then Spain up in the mid-single digits. So we're very positive about that. And then Philippines, Christine, obviously a very, very challenging environment in the Philippines, with the aftereffects of food inflation still lingering on. There was a lot of hot money that came into the Philippines' economy back about 4 quarters ago, back during the election, and I think we're cycling that period. But the good news is that we're doing the right things in the Philippines, investing in our brands, gaining market share in the Philippines in both sparkling and still beverages, and getting stronger in the Philippines. And therefore, when the current environment stabilizes, and we do believe that we're going to come out of the tunnel stronger and better in the Philippines, where our penetration is growing in all different socioeconomic retail outlets, as well as driving volume and value share and brand health getting better for both Coca-Cola as well as our allied brands, Sprite and Fanta, but also for our still beverage brands."

But again, all the time, all the time, I repeat, consumer-led pricing as opposed to just costs-led, and because it's a balance that is really critically important. And also, the value share gain is something that is right on top of the radar screen for us."

On behalf of our 140,000 associates at The Coca-Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targe",2926,"Thanks, Jackson. And good morning, everyone. On behalf of our 140,000 associates at The Coca-Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the sixth consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. 
We continue to advance our global momentum from a position of real strength, realizing growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. For both the quarter and year-to-date, we once more gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio keeps growing, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. This growth was driven by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. 
And earlier this month, Interbrand ranked Coke Cola as the world's most valuable brand for the 12th consecutive year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 9% for both this quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved these balanced quality results together with our system bottling partners during a time of ongoing global market volatility, which is a testament to our clear and focused vision, our strong brands and our solid execution. 
Over the past few months, we've all seen a downturn in global consumer confidence. At the same time, the last few months have reinforced our belief in the resilience of the global consumer. In our business, we constantly track a number of key metrics. We look at total retail sales by country. We look at sales shifts across retail channels. We look at out of home dining and how many people are on the go. 
And what we've seen this past quarter is that across the world, nonalcoholic beverages continue to generate increasing demand. The key success factor in this current challenging environment is for business small, medium or large to be able to generate sustainable growth. And I'm happy that we're able to continue to crack this much-needed algorithm of growth. 
In Q3 of 2011, we generated almost 250 million unit cases of incremental growth, excluding cross-license and acquired brands with nearly 50% of this growth coming from sparkling beverages. Just to give you a perspective, this 250 million unit cases of organic volume growth translates into over $1.7 billion of retail value growth, all in 90 days. For the first 9 months of this year, our organic volume growth was over 820 million unit cases, equivalent to creating another India and Russia combined. 
This achievement of growth as the combined result of precise and focused execution by our inspired system in each quarter combined with the targeted investments made by our system a year or in some cases 2 years prior to the quarter, which is being reported. So while we all see volatility in the external environment and gave every reason to believe that this volatility will remain through the near-term the assumptions that guided the development of our 2020 vision still ring true as we complete the seventh quarter in our 2020 Vision, we see a world where population keeps growing at a very rapid rate, up 200 million since just 2008. 
At the same time, the world's largest cities are growing and have grown by almost 100 million people in the same period since 2008. And the global middle class is also growing. In fact, since 2008 almost 200 million people have nearly entered the middle class. We said it when we began our 2020 Vision journey and we say it again right now in 2011, our business was built for times like this. Our business is strong across channels and across consumer age groups. We're well-positioned to connect with global consumers who have a greater disposition to shop across multiple retail channels in search of real value. 
So simply said, we provide consumers with an affordable luxury as they enjoy moments of pleasure at a time, billions of times every day. In February of this year during our presentation at CAGNY, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, we told you that when you have a consistent vision, a consistent belief in your brand, a consistent ethic of execution, the result is consistent quality performance. And while we may see an occasional bump along the road in a given quarter, every year since 2006, we've delivered volume and operating income growth in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. 
We said this again at CAGNY back in February that this trend remains true today. All of our attributes, a well aligned bottling franchise system, healthy brands, strong financial performance and a clear 2020 Vision have put us in a position of real strength as we push ahead towards 2020. And that's why even during times of ongoing global market uncertainty, The Coca-Cola Company keeps delivering consistent top line and bottom line results. 
So let's review this quarter's results. We grew worldwide volume 5% this quarter and 6% year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong volume growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date ahead of our long-term growth target. 
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 12% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10% also above our long-term growth targets. Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. Many of you on today's call listened in or joined us last month in Houston for our investor event and market tour. You heard and saw firsthand how we are building our capabilities to drive our performance in North America. 
This quarter's results underscore the good progress we are making on this journey. North America reported volume up 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, making this North America's sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Our organic volume growth in North America was up 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In this past quarter our North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic beverages, reaffirming our commitment to drive balanced growth across our portfolio. 
Our sparkling beverages in North America were down only slightly in the quarter with brand Coca-Cola volume even for the quarter. And we clearly outperformed the rest of the industry gaining both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category. And we did so while earning 3% pricing in sparkling beverages this quarter through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies. 
We are driving profitable growth in North America through our 1.25-liter package which expanded nationally in August and is now available in over 80% of the U.S. supermarkets. And those markets where the 1.25-liter package was first launched in May of this year, we saw the combination of our 1.25-liter and 2-liter package transaction increase this quarter. We're also expanding the availability of our immediate consumption offerings with a new 12.5-ounce handheld PET packaged and a more affordable 7.5 ounce mini-can APAC. 
As for Coke Zero it was up 12% in North America this past quarter, making this its 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered mid-single digit growth and gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. The leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth in the quarter and is now up 12% on a year-to-date basis. POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category this past quarter. And since July of 2010, POWERADE has added over 5 million new households, demonstrating how this innovative brand keeps resonating with sports drink consumers. 
Our key brands delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit growth for Gold Peak Tea. Finally, as many of you heard during our Houston event last month, our CCR Coca-Cola Refreshments integration is proceeding as planned. We remain confident that we have the right brands, right strategies and right capabilities in place for North America as we continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group where we are delivering growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. This quarter's result were led by double-digit growth in China up 11%, sparkling beverages grew mid-single digits in China this past quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 7%, supported by our strategy to introduce a wider variety of singleserve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio. 
Last quarter we said this emphasis on single-serve packages would increase transactions and build brand equity. In fact, we observed 12% growth in sparkling beverage transactions in China this past quarter, well ahead of sparkling beverage volume growth. This is in line with our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our brand, while better positioning our China sparkling beverage for long-term sustainable growth. 
At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio in China keeps building momentum, up 24% this quarter and 19% year-to-date, led by Minute Maid Pulpy. We're confident that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long term. Japan's third quarter results were down 3%. We always expect to see our volume softer in Japan this quarter as we cycled 11% growth from last year's record hot summer conditions, while also working through the after-effect of the tragic national disaster in March. 
And that said, Japan's volume results this past quarter were better than we had originally thought, underscoring once again the strength as well as the resilience of our Japanese bottling system. We remain confident in the long-term health of our business in Japan. Moving now to Latin America. We continue to expand our volume and value share leadership across the region with volume up 7% to both the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 10% on a year-to-date basis. 
Importantly brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 6% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date. We gained both volume and value share in Mexico despite new pricing above the current rate of inflation. Our results in Mexico are a great testament to our team's capability to execute occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies that reinforce recruitment, as well as affordability with consumers in this key marketplace. We're also see seeing further momentum in our Argentina business, which delivered double-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 11th consecutive quarter there. 
Finally, Brazil volume was up 1%, cycling 13% growth in last year's comparable period. Having said that, our growth in Brazil is ahead of the industry with our business in Brazil gaining share across both sparkling as well as still beverages. This reinforces our confidence that we have the right strategies in place in Brazil to build on our leadership position and keep expanding our share of industry growth in the years ahead. Brazil also offers a great example of how we partner with local communities during challenging economic times. We recently established a social business program in Brazil called Colletivo [ph] that aims to create shared value with communities through our core business activities. And in partnership with local NGOs, we teach entrepreneurship and retailing skills to young adults living in low income areas supporting their entry into the formal job market. 
Colletivo [ph] prepares students through 2 months of training to deliver customized business opportunities to small outlets inside their communities. And we are providing a positive economic impact in these areas, while also helping us drive solid business results. And we are in the process of expanding this program across Brazil we strongly believe we have a role to play in helping consumers through tough economic times. And through this program we are grading unique value for our brands, our system as well as local communities. 
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa. We are strategically investing for tomorrow across a diverse array of markets, while gaining both volume and value share today. Volume in this region grew 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, led by strong results in India, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. India delivered 19% both in the quarter, making this its 21st consecutive quarter of growth and bringing our year-to-date volume growth to double digits. This quality growth was well balanced across the entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up 19% this quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola's strong double-digit growth up 17%. And still beverages in India were up 17% again in the quarter, benefiting from healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including brand up 19%. 
Turkey was up double digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, gaining volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. And Turkey is benefiting from our investments in Coke Link equipment, which is increasing cold beverage availability for us in this key market. Russia was down mid-single digits this past quarter, cycling very strong 30% growth from the same period last year. At the same time, our business in Russia outperformed the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share in the process. And as you may have heard, we recently announced together with our bottling partners Coca-Cola Hellenic new Russian investment program of $3 billion over the next 5 years starting in 2012, underscoring our commitment to invest in Russia for the long-term growth. 
Finally, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 9% growth in the quarter as we strengthened our position in this key region. Let me now move to Europe, a part of the world that faced an increasingly volatile economic environment as well as unseasonably cold weather this past quarter. Despite the challenges, we gained volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and volume also grew slightly in the quarter rounding to even making this Europe's fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth. And our year-to-date results in Europe are up 2%. 
Our growth in Europe continues to be led by Germany, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our business in Germany gained volume and value share in sparkling and in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages segment. Our sparkling beverage growth in Germany was led by Coca-Cola, up 5% for the quarter as a result of our strategic focus on both consumers and a whole new generation of new consumers. 
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our progress around winning at the point of sale by driving immediate consumption growth. Year-to-date, we are sustaining our strong momentum against this priority with immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. Last quarter, we shared that each of our geographic operating groups was growing our immediate consumption beverage business. To date, we can further confirm that 17 of our top 22 markets are also growing our immediate consumption beverage business on a year-to-date basis. 
In fact, 9 of these markets are growing immediate consumption ahead of future consumption. This is quite an accomplishment in an economic environment, which favors faster growth in at-home consumption. As the world's population and demographics keep growing and evolving, our system is focused on capturing more than our fair share of this highly profitable immediate consumption growth. In closing, I'd like to say that we are advancing our momentum during a time of mixed economic recovery. Back in 2008 and 2009, when the world's financial markets were unraveling, our system committed to doing 3 things. First, we made a commitment to invest through the crisis. We did so by establishing a clear and focused 2020 vision that called for investing in consumer marketing and sales and distribution with the mission of becoming the leader in every market in every category of value to us. 
Second, we made a commitment to focus on the marketplace and to ensure that we have the right packages and price points for every occasion, including affordable entry packs for every consumer. And thirdly, we made a commitment to never let short-term considerations cloud our view for the long-term value of our business. As a result of these commitments, our system has never been stronger. We continue to solidify our leadership within the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry and during 2009 and '10, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value. 
We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented nearly 50% of total industry growth, well above our fair share. So in short, our 2020 Vision is working. Yet every one of us here at The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system know that we are really just getting started. All of us remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future. The future filled with abundant opportunities. Our job as stewards of this great business and as caretakers of your investment is to ensure that we keep advancing our system's momentum. With our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we are confident that we can sustainably achieve our long-term growth target and enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

We are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets.

We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter, up 12% versus prior year, that brings year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, ahead of our long-term growth target. For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 21%, including a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This increases our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 17%, including a 5% currency benefit offset by commodity headwinds. 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 45% this quarter, including a 5% increase in constant rate sales, a 5% currency benefit, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth remains at 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, 5% benefit from currency, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined international and Bottling Investments Group's price mix for the quarter was a positive 2%. As for North America, we discussed in our last earnings call our plans to implement incremental pricing programs with many of our customers this quarter. As a result, our pricing to retailers in North America was up 2% in the quarter. And as Muhtar mentioned this quarter's results was driven by 3% increase in our pricing to retailers for our North American sparkling beverages. 
As such, our 2011 North American pricing strategy remains on track to earn between 2% and 3% for the full year, leveraging both rate and mix levers to earn price at a premium to our industry. As we continue to grow in North America through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies, which we shared with many of you last month during our investor event and market tour in Houston. If you were not in Houston with us last month or were unable to view the live webcast of our event, we encourage you to visit our website for all of videos and presentations from Houston detailing our North American roadmap for growth have been posted. 
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 42% in the quarter and 46% year-to-date. As explained in previous quarterly calls, this increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we will cycle in the fourth quarter of this year. It also reflects our continued investments around the world. Year-to-date direct marketing expenses are growing slightly ahead of unit cases as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. As we communicated last quarter, we expect our full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investments Group and even for the full year for our international operations as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets around the world. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations came in at $6.8 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year. Net of the additional pension plan contributions or cash flow from operations are up 5% year-to-date. Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook for commodities and currencies. First, we've effectively leveraged retail pricing increases and the acceleration of call saving initiatives to help offset this year's rising commodity cost. Having said that, our incremental calls testament for 2011 now stands at approximately $800 million, ahead of the $700 million we indicated in our previous calls. 
Second, since our last earnings call in July of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening against many key currencies. We have hedged positions in place for most key currencies for the remainder of this year. We now expect currencies to adversely impact our fourth quarter operating income by low- to mid-single digits, while still providing a low- to mid-single digit positive impact for the full year. 
As we planned for 2012, we are looking at our combined exposure across both currencies and commodities. We anticipate that both items will keep moving in opposite directions next year, much like they have this year. And while we expect this movement to help partially offset each other's impact over the course of 2012, the timing of their respective impact on our results will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. As for our normal practice, we'll provide a broader outlook on their expected impact on our 2012 full year results during our next earnings call in February. 
Now let me take a moment to update you on several other programs and line items. Our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008 remain on track to exceed the upper end of our original target of $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of this year. As for synergies related to our CCE transaction, we still expect to deliver between $140 million and $150 million of net call synergies in 2011. 
With regards to our share repurchase program on a year-to-date basis, our net share repurchases stand at $2.2 billion. As such, we're now increasing our share repurchase program with a plan to purchase at least 2.5 billion to 3 billion in net shares this year. As for net interest income, our current forecast for the full year is at the high end of our previously communicated range of $30 million to $40 million. This implies a slight net interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year. And our underlying effective tax rate stands at 24%. 
Finally, we want to remind you that this is the last quarter in which we're cycling the acquisition of CCE's former North America business. That said, there were several one-time items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to this acquisition that will continue to impact the comparability of both our as reported and ongoing recurring results next quarter. We refer you to our previous comments regarding those one-time items specifically to our modeling call held last year on December 14. The transcript and webcast of that call can be found on our investor website and of course Jackson and our Investor Relations team will be happy to follow up with you separately if you have any further questions. 
In closing, we're greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results in the face of today's volatile market conditions our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our flexible and nimble growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. 
In fact, The Coca-Cola Company has a long history of distributing dividends having paid them consecutively every year since 1920 and increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years. With our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners, we are confident that we'll keep taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to build in our strengths, advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision.

I think the whole year has been one of mix consumer sentiment across the world in general, Bill. But what I'd like to say is that still I believe that the challenging areas are going to be certainly the Western markets primarily I believe, the U.S. environment as well as the European environment best Western European environment is still going to be challenging, as challenging as the past 9 months and the full year. This year probably and in that environment, we're delivering positive results because our strategies are working, because of our past investments and how we execute against our vision, strength of our brands. We're gaining market share and I think when you look at our broad-based investment programs that we have announced, multiyear investment programs that we have announced, whether they're in the Pacific in places like Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam, whether they're in Eurasia and Africa like India and Pakistan and Africa and the recent Russian investment that I announced when I was there 2 weeks ago in operating a plant in Rostov in the southern part of Russia with bottling partners or whether investments, multi-year investments, in Mexico, Brazil, these total over $25 billion and you have these investments that are working for us despite the challenging environment, despite the confused consumer and despite the fact that the general environment is certainly much worse than ideal. However, I think that there will still be areas of growth in the world that we are going to materially benefit from. In Africa, where our system is very strong, in Asia and Middle East and Eurasia where our system is very strong and in Latin America. And we will continue to re-architect our brand priced pack channel offering both here and the United States as well as across the world just like we did in China, just like we did across many other parts of the world to ensure that we can still crack that code for growth on a sustainable basis. And we believe that we can continue to deliver growth in line with our long-term strategies. And yes, there may be a bump along the way in a quarter sometimes but over the longer period and over the medium and longer period, we believe despite the economic conditions in the world that much less than ideal, we believe we can continue to crack that algorithm for growth as we move forward."

We also grew sparkling volume and value share and maintained slow volume share for the overall group, the European group. And again reported net revenue for the quarter and I think that was a performance that we were pleased with the given the conditions in Europe and over Central and Southern Europe, volume declined. And I think the Eastern and Central European area was still challenging, but South East Europe particularly also in a plea increase. But I believe overall to the portfolio work for us like it did in the previous quarters in this year and I believe that's what's going to continue to work for us as we move into the fourth quarter and the final quarter of this year as well as into next year. Brands are stronger than ever before. We're gaining market share and we have many innovations that are working for us in both packaging as well as in the still beverage portfolio area.

And relative to 2012 really we'll go through all of that in February on the year end call on everything around 2012. Because I think one of the important things is to put everything in perspective. Number one, with the volatility I'm not sure I can give you a prediction on 2012 and it really mean anything. But the other, and I said a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, what we're seeing is not a direct correlation but a lot of correlation between currencies and commodities. And so every time you see a big spike in the strength of the dollar, you see commodities come off strongly and vice versa. So we're starting to see a natural hedge and offset in the portfolio currencies and commodities and we're looking at those together. And then we're looking at how we hedge them for the best results.

So we've done a good job. In fact, what I see on pricing in North America, we pointed out that pricing was plus 2 in North America but plus 3 on Sparkling. And in fact, we're cycling, this is a good news, bad news thing. So let me kind of go through it so you understand it. What we got is very good positive mix, particularly around packaging and you saw a lot of packaging initiatives in Houston. We've also got a negative mix in North America related to the Sawhney. And this is actually good news but at first blush, you would think well negative, negative price mix on the Sawhney. What it is really where the PlantBottle has come through with our customers really identifying it within our consumers and the Sawhney being relisted in quite a few national retailers so it's really been a huge positive for us even though it put a little pressure on the price mix in the quarter.

I hope you were able to see first-hand some of that when you were in Houston. But just go anywhere and you'll see differences. You'll see, your eye will pick up differences across the country. The philosophy, the belief in the business, the belief in the ability that where we can grow this business, that these per capita are nowhere near the ceiling. And the belief that the inspiration is resonating, the marketing combined with execution will resonate and translate into a growth algorithm. It starts with that and I think there's great learnings not just from Latin America execution and family-owned bottling business or even larger bottling business and America and many parts of the world, whether it's in European Coca-Cola Hellenic territories, whether it's in Turkey and CCI territories, whether it's in some other territories in South Europe, Iberian Peninsula. There's that philosophy of execution that was lost to a great deal, extent in the United Stated and that's coming back. It's coming back rapidly and I think that's what gives us excitement about the future of our business here. Now in terms of your question related to Latin America per se, and yes, we're very happy with our performance in Latin America both this past quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis. And again, it's a great portfolio of countries. You've seen Brazil slow down a little bit naturally because we were cycling a very high number from prior year, 13%. But I think also at the same time other countries are coming back to generate a very healthy result overall in our Latin American business. And I have also said this before and I want to reiterate, we're just starting with our Still Beverage business in Latin America. It's just the beginning of the journey and it's still at very low per caps and very low beginning. And there is a great future as we continue to maintain the momentum in our Sparkling Beverage business in Latin America. The Still Beverage business, that growth is just going to come on top of that and that's what I think what we're building rapidly in Latin America both in our juice and juice drinks business but also in our teas and layouts and other such still beverages."

We totally, respectfully disagree that that's very far from where our mind is about the United States. And there's a number of reasons why we believe that. First, the demographics in North America are in our favor. They are the best demographic of any Western nation in the world. We're going to be adding between now and then our vision 30 million people to the population of the United States. It'll have the third highest teen population. And this -- everyone that has been against the United States in the past have lost and I respectfully believe very much so that we'll get it right also from a macro perspective here for the diversity of our population, the entrepreneurial spirit, the amount of university graduates that we attract from all around the world, the best. And so we have every reason to believe that this business that if we can't grow, it's our fault, simple as that. And we won't accept that. And therefore, we are growing and we will continue to grow. We never said they we're going to grow at rates of China or India. We said that we'll generate moderate growth rates in America and that we will continue to improve our business and generate higher revenue than our volume and generate higher income than our revenue.

I'm not projecting that right now because of the crisis going on in Europe and if they could just get their communications consistent, it'd probably help some of the volatility over there. But the dollar's over valued but it is overvalued because of fear right now in the financial markets. So with that said, long-term I think we probably benefit.

But we saw those trends and we invested against those to ensure that we would actually continue to drive our immediate consumption business, whether it is on the streets of Italy or whether it's on the streets of Shanghai or in Africa. And so what does that entail, that entails more cold drink equipment, targeted cold drink equipment. That included a new architecture of packaging and pricing that would make it more attractive for on-the-go consumers to find packages that were affordable for them, and we did that in China and successfully in parts of Asia successfully, in many parts of Eurasia as we did here in America. And I think it's worked and you heard me just announced also that we will be launching even more on-the-go packages here in the United States. So this strategy of investment ahead of the curve in infrastructure, particularly in cold drink infrastructure, coupled with the intelligent packaging moves, progressive packaging moves, have helped us in this area and will continue to help us. And then lay on top of that also some innovative moves like the freestyle expansion of freestyle across and freestyle is now in 2 markets around the world as we speak in the United States, in Japan and continuing to create a lot of excitement. And then also overlay on top of that other innovations like I LOHAS in Japan driving results for us in the immediate consumption and convenience store channel and so you get the picture, I hope."

On behalf of our 140,000 associates at The Coca-Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered performance results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the sixth consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. 
We continue to advance our global momentum from a position of real strength, realizing growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. For both the quarter and year-to-date, we once more gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio keeps growing, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. This growth was driven by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. And earlier this month, Interbrand ranked Coke-Cola as the world's most valuable brand for the 12th consecutive year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 9% for both this quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved these balanced quality results together with our system bottling partners during a time of ongoing global market volatility, which is a testament to our clear and focused vision, our strong brands and our solid execution.  
Over the past few months, we've all seen a downturn in global consumer confidence. At the same time, the last few months have reinforced our belief in the resilience of the global consumer. In our business, we constantly track a number of key metrics. We look at total retail sales by country. We look at sales shifts across retail channels. We look at out of home dining and how many people are on the go. And what we've seen this past quarter is that, across the world, nonalcoholic beverages continue to generate increasing demand. The key success factor in this current challenging environment is for businesses small, medium or large to be able to generate sustainable growth. And I'm happy that we're able to continue to crack this much-needed algorithm of growth. In Q3 of 2011, we generated almost 250 million unit cases of incremental growth, excluding cross-license and acquired brands, with nearly 50% of this growth coming from sparkling beverages. Just to give you a perspective, this 250 million unit cases of organic volume growth translates into over $1.7 billion of retail value growth, all in 90 days. For the first 9 months of this year, our organic volume growth was over 820 million unit cases, equivalent to creating another India and Russia combined. This achievement of growth is the combined result of precise and focused execution by our inspired system in each quarter combined with the targeted investments made by our system a year or in some cases 2 years prior to the quarter, which is being reported.
So while we all see volatility in the external environment and have every reason to believe that this volatility will remain through the near-term, the assumptions that guided the development of our 2020 Vision still ring true. As we complete the seventh quarter in our 2020 Vision, we see a world where population keeps growing at a very rapid rate, up 200 million since just 2008. At the same time, the world's largest cities are growing and have grown by almost 100 million people in the same period since 2008. And the global middle class is also growing. In fact, since 2008 almost 200 million people have newly entered the middle class. We said it when we began our 2020 Vision journey and we say it again right now in 2011, our business was built for times like this. Our business is strong across channels and across consumer age groups. We're well-positioned to connect with global consumers who have a greater disposition to shop across multiple retail channels in search of real value. So simply said, we provide consumers with an affordable luxury as they enjoy moments of pleasure for pennies at a time, billions of times every day. In February of this year during our presentation at CAGNY, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, we told you that when you have a consistent vision, a consistent belief in your brand, a consistent ethic of execution, the result is consistent quality performance. And while we may see an occasional bump along the road in a given quarter, every year since 2006, we've delivered volume and operating income growth in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. We said this, again at CAGNY back in February, that this trend remains true today. All of our attributes, a well aligned bottling franchise system, healthy brands, strong financial performance and a clear 2020 Vision have put us in a position of real strength as we push ahead towards 2020. And that's why even during times of ongoing global market uncertainty, The Coca-Cola Company keeps delivering consistent top line and bottom line results.
So let's review this quarter's results. We grew worldwide volume 5% this quarter and 6% year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong volume growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date ahead of our long-term growth target. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 12% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, also above our long-term growth targets.
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. Many of you on today's call have listened in or joined us last month in Houston for our investor event and market tour. You heard and saw firsthand how we are building our capabilities to drive our performance in North America. This quarter's results underscore the good progress we are making on this journey. North America reported volume, up 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, making this North America's sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Our organic volume growth in North America was up 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In this past quarter our North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic beverages, reaffirming our commitment to drive balanced growth across our portfolio.
Our sparkling beverages in North America were down only slightly in the quarter with brand Coca-Cola volume even for the quarter. And we clearly outperformed the rest of the industry gaining both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category. And we did so while earning 3% pricing in sparkling beverages this quarter through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies. We are driving profitable growth in North America through our 1.25-liter package which expanded nationally in August and is now available in over 80% of the U.S. supermarkets. And those markets, where the 1.25-liter package was first launched in May of this year, we saw the combination of our 1.25-liter and 2-liter package transaction increase this quarter. We're also expanding the availability of our immediate consumption offerings with a new 12.5-ounce handheld PET packaged and a more affordable 7.5 ounce mini-can 8-pack. 
As for Coke Zero it was up 12% in North America this past quarter, making this its 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered mid-single digit growth and gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. The leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth in the quarter and is now up 12% on a year-to-date basis. POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category this past quarter. And since July of 2010, POWERADE has added over 5 million new households, demonstrating how this innovative brand keeps resonating with sports drink consumers. 
Our key brands delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit growth for Gold Peak Tea. Finally, as many of you heard during our Houston event last month, our CCR Coca-Cola Refreshments integration is proceeding as planned. We remain confident that we have the right brands, right strategies and right capabilities in place for North America as we continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group where we are delivering growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. This quarter's result were led by double-digit growth in China, up 11%. Sparkling beverages grew mid-single digits in China this past quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 7%, supported by our strategy to introduce a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio. Last quarter we said this emphasis on single-serve packages would increase transactions and build brand equity. In fact, we observed 12% growth in sparkling beverage transactions in China this past quarter, well ahead of sparkling beverage volume growth. This is in line with our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our brands, while better positioning our China sparkling business for long-term sustainable growth.  At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio in China keeps building momentum, up 24% this quarter and 19% year-to-date, led by Minute Maid Pulpy. We're confident that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long term.
Japan's third quarter results were down 3%. We always expect seeing our volume soften in Japan this quarter as we cycled 11% growth from last year's record hot summer conditions, while also working through the after-effects of the tragic national disaster in March. And that said, Japan's volume results this past quarter were better than we had originally thought, underscoring once again the strength as well as the resilience of our Japanese bottling system. We remain confident in the long-term health of our business in Japan.
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to expand our volume and value share leadership across the region with volume up 7% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 10% on a year-to-date basis. Importantly brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 6% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date. We gained both volume and value share in Mexico despite new pricing above the current rate of inflation. Our results in Mexico are a great testament to our team's capability to execute occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies that reinforce recruitment, as well as affordability with consumers in this key marketplace. We're also see seeing further momentum in our Argentina business, which delivered double-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 11th consecutive quarter there. Finally, Brazil volume was up 1%, cycling 13% growth in last year's comparable period. Having said that, our growth in Brazil is ahead of the industry with our business in Brazil gaining share across both sparkling as well as still beverages. This reinforces our confidence that we have the right strategies in place in Brazil to build on our leadership position and keep expanding our share of industry growth in the years ahead.
Brazil also offers a great example of how we partner with local communities during challenging economic times. We recently established a social business program in Brazil called Coletivo, that aims to create shared value with communities through our core business activities. And in partnership with local NGOs, we teach entrepreneurship and retailing skills to young adults living in low income areas supporting their entry into the formal job market.  Coletivo prepares students through 2 months of training to deliver customized business opportunities to small outlets inside their communities. And we're providing a positive economic impact in these areas, while also helping us drive solid business results. And we are in the process of expanding this program across Brazil for we strongly believe we have a role to play in helping consumers through tough economic times. And through this program we're creating unique value for our brands, our system as well as local communities. 
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa. We are strategically investing for tomorrow across a diverse array of markets, while gaining both volume and value share today. Volume in this region grew 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, led by strong results in India, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. India delivered 19% both in the quarter, making this its 21st consecutive quarter of growth and bringing our year-to-date volume growth to double digits. This quality growth was well balanced across the entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up 19% this quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola's strong double-digit growth up 17%. And still beverages in India were up 17% again in the quarter, benefiting from healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including brand Maaza, up 19%.  Turkey was up double digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, gaining volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. And Turkey is benefiting from our investments in cold drink equipment, which is increasing cold beverage availability for us in this key market.  
Russia was down mid-single digits this past quarter, cycling very strong 30% growth from the same period last year. At the same time, our business in Russia outperformed the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume, and value share in the process. And as you may have heard we recently announced, together with our bottling partners Coca-Cola Hellenic, a new Russian investment program of $3 billion over the next 5 years starting in 2012, underscoring our commitment to invest in Russia for the long-term growth. Finally, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 9% growth in the quarter as we strengthened our position in this key region.
Let me now move to Europe, a part of the world that faced an increasingly volatile economic environment, as well as unseasonably cold weather this past quarter. Despite the challenges, we gained volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and volume also grew slightly in the quarter rounding to even making this Europe's fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth. And our year-to-date results in Europe are up 2%. Our growth in Europe continues to be led by Germany, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our business in Germany gained volume and value share in sparkling and in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages segment. Our sparkling beverage growth in Germany was led by Coca-Cola, up 5% for the quarter as a result of our strategic focus on recruiting both lapsed consumers and a whole new generation of new consumers. 
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our progress around winning at the point-of-sale by driving immediate consumption growth. Year-to-date, we are sustaining our strong momentum against this priority with immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. Last quarter, we shared that each of our geographic operating groups was growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business. To date, we can further confirm that 17 of our top 22 markets are also growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. In fact, 9 of these markets are growing immediate consumption ahead of future consumption. This is quite an accomplishment in an economic environment, which favors faster growth in at-home consumption. As the world's population and demographics keep growing and evolving, our system is focused on capturing more than our fair share of this highly profitable immediate consumption growth. 
In closing, I'd like to say that we're advancing our momentum during a time of mixed economic recovery. Back in 2008 and 2009, when the world's financial markets were unraveling, our system committed to doing 3 things. First, we made a commitment to invest through the crisis. We did so by establishing a clear and focused 2020 vision that called for investing in consumer marketing and sales and distribution with the mission of becoming the leader in every market in every category of value to us. 
Second, we made a commitment to focus on the marketplace and to ensure that we have the right packages and price points for every occasion, including affordable entry packs for every consumer. And thirdly, we made a commitment to never let short-term considerations cloud our view of the long-term value of our business. As a result of these commitments, our system has never been stronger. We continue to solidify our leadership within the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry and during 2009 and '10, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented nearly 50% of total industry growth, well above our fair share. So in short, our 2020 Vision is working. Yet, every one of us here at The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system know that we are really just getting started. All of us remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future. The future filled with abundant opportunities. Our job as stewards of this great business and as caretakers of your investment is to ensure that we keep advancing our system's momentum. With our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we are confident that we can sustainably achieve our long-term growth target and enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mix",1240,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter, up 12% versus prior year. That brings year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, ahead of our long-term growth target. For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 21%, including a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This increases our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 17%, including a 5% currency benefit offset by commodity headwinds.  
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 45% this quarter, including a 5% increase in constant rate sales, a 5% currency benefit, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth remains at 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, 5% benefit from currency, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined international and Bottling Investments Group's price mix for the quarter was a positive 2%. As for North America, we discussed in our last earnings call our plans to implement incremental pricing programs with many of our customers this quarter. As a result, our pricing to retailers in North America was up 2% in the quarter. And as Muhtar mentioned this quarter's results was driven by a 3% increase in our pricing to retailers for our North American sparkling beverages. As such, our 2011 North American pricing strategy remains on track to earn between 2% and 3% for the full year, leveraging both rate and mix levers to earn price at a premium to our industry. As we continue to grow in North America through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies, which we shared with many of you last month during our investor event and market tour in Houston. If you were not in Houston with us last month or were unable to view the live webcast of our event, we encourage you to visit our website where all videos and presentations from Houston detailing our North American roadmap for growth have been posted.
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 42% in the quarter and 46% year-to-date. As explained in previous quarterly calls, this increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we will cycle in the fourth quarter of this year. It also reflects our continued investments around the world. Year-to-date direct marketing expenses are growing slightly ahead of unit cases as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. As we communicated last quarter, we expect our full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investments Group and even for the full year for our international operations as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets around the world. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations came in at $6.8 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year. Net of the additional pension plan contributions, our cash flow from operations are up 5% year-to-date.
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook for commodities and currencies. First, we've effectively leveraged retail pricing increases and the acceleration of cost saving initiatives to help offset this year's rising commodity cost. Having said that, our incremental cost estimate for 2011 now stands at approximately $800 million, ahead of the $700 million we indicated in our previous calls. Second, since our last earnings call in July of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening against many key currencies. We have hedged positions in place for most key currencies for the remainder of this year. We now expect currencies to adversely impact our fourth quarter operating income by low- to mid-single digits, while still providing a low- to mid-single digit positive impact for the full year. As we planned for 2012, we are looking at our combined exposure across both currencies and commodities. We anticipate that both items will keep moving in opposite directions next year, much like they have this year. And while we expect this movement to help partially offset each other's impact over the course of 2012, the timing of their respective impact on our results will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. As for our normal practice, we'll provide a broader outlook on their expected impact on our 2012 full year results during our next earnings call in February. 
Now let me take a moment to update you on several other programs and line items. Our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008 remain on track to exceed the upper end of our original target of $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of this year. As for synergies related to our CCE transaction, we still expect to deliver between $140 million and $150 million of net call synergies in 2011. With regards to our share repurchase program, on a year-to-date basis, our net share repurchases stand at $2.2 billion. As such, we're now increasing our share repurchase program with a plan to purchase at least 2.5 billion to 3 billion in net shares this year. As for net interest income, our current forecast for the full year is at the high end of our previously communicated range of $30 million to $40 million. This implies a slight net interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year. And our underlying effective tax rate stands at 24%. 
Finally, we want to remind you that this is the last quarter in which we're cycling the acquisition of CCE's former North American business. That said, there were several one-time items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to this acquisition that will continue to impact the comparability of both our as-reported and ongoing recurring results next quarter. We refer you to our previous comments regarding those one-time items, specifically to our modeling call held last year on December 14. The transcript and webcast of that call can be found on our investor website and of course Jackson and our Investor Relations team will be happy to follow up with you separately if you have any further questions.
In closing, we're greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results in the face of today's volatile market conditions our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our flexible and nimble growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. In fact, The Coca-Cola Company has a long history of distributing dividends, having paid them consecutively every year since 1920 and increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years. With our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners, we're confident that we'll keep taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision.
Operator, we're now ready for questions."

I think the whole year has been one of mixed consumer sentiment across the world in general, Bill. But what I'd like to say is that, still I believe that the challenging areas are going to be, certainly the Western markets primarily I believe. The U.S. environment as well as the European environment -- Western European environment is still going to be challenging, as challenging as the past 9 months and the full year, this year probably. And in that environment, we're delivering positive results because our strategies are working, because of our past investments and how we execute against our vision, strength of our brands. We're gaining market share and I think, when you look at our broad-based investment programs that we have announced, multiyear investment programs that we have announced. Whether they're in the Pacific in places like Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam. Whether they're in Eurasia and Africa like India and Pakistan and Africa and the recent Russian investment that I announced when I was there 2 weeks ago, in operating a plant in Rostov, in the southern part of Russia with our Hellenic bottling partners or whether investments, multi-year investments, in Mexico, Brazil. These total over $25 billion and you have these investments that are working for us despite the challenging environment, despite the confused consumer and despite the fact that the general environment is certainly much worse than ideal. However, I think that there will still be areas of growth in the world that we are going to materially benefit from. In Africa, where our system is very strong, in Asia and Middle East and Eurasia where our system is very strong and in Latin America. And we will continue to re-architect our brand-priced pack channel offering both here and the United States as well as across the world just like we did in China, just like we did across many other parts of the world, to ensure that we can still crack that code for growth on a sustainable basis. And we believe that we can continue to deliver growth in line with our long-term strategies. And yes, there may be a bump along the way in a quarter sometimes. But over the longer period and over the medium and longer period, we believe, despite the economic conditions in the world that are much less than ideal, we believe we can continue to crack that algorithm for growth as we move forward."

And also the moderating consumer confidence. But I think we realized nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share gains across the whole of Europe, France -- including France, Germany, Great Britain. We also grew sparkling volume and value share and maintained still volume share for the overall group -- the European group. And again reported net revenue for the quarter and I think that was a performance that we were pleased with, given the conditions in Europe. And over Central and Southern Europe, volume declined. And I think the Eastern Central European area was still challenging, and South East Europe, particularly also, in Italy and Greece. But I believe, overall, the portfolio work for us like it did in the previous quarters in this year. And I believe that's what's going to continue to work for us as we move into the fourth quarter and the final quarter of this year as well as into next year. Brands are stronger than ever before. We're gaining market share and we have many innovations that are working for us in both packaging as well as in the still beverage portfolio area. And our marketing is working for us and next year we've got European championships, which is a Coca-Cola property as you know, and we're going to leverage that in a very significant manner. And of course the Olympics, and those 2 properties are going to be very strong for us."

And although this is kind of -- say, how do I answer this -- -- because we had some hedge positions and we're buying some more now at higher prices even though prices have come off a little bit. So the $100 million, by the way, was not a big surprise to us. Over the last couple of months, we saw it coming. And relative to 2012, really we'll go through all of that in February, on the year end call, on everything around 2012. Because I think one of the important things is to put everything in perspective. Number one was the volatility, I'm not sure I can give you a prediction on 2012 and it really mean anything. But the other, and I said a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, what we're seeing is not a direct correlation but a lot of correlation between currencies and commodities. And so every time you see a big spike in the strength of the dollar, you see commodities come off strongly and vice versa. So we're starting to see a natural hedge and offsets in the portfolio of currencies and commodities, and we're looking at those together, and then looking at how we hedge them for the best results. So we'll go through that in February."

So we've done a good job. In fact, what I said on pricing in North America, we pointed out that pricing was plus 2 in North America but plus 3 on Sparkling. And in fact, we're cycling -- this is a good news, bad news thing. So let me kind of go through it so you understand it. What we got is very good positive mix, particularly around packaging and you saw a lot of packaging initiatives in Houston. We've also got a negative mix in North America related to the DASANI. And this is actually good news, but at first blush you would think, well negative, negative price mix on DASANI. What it is really where the PlantBottle has come through, with our customers really identifying it, with it and our consumers, and DASANI being relisted in quite a few national retailers. So it's really been a huge positive for us even though it put a little pressure on the price mix in the quarter. So it's a real positive."

I hope you were able to see first-hand some of that when you were in Houston. But just go anywhere and you'll see differences. You'll see -- your eye will pick up differences across the country. The philosophy, the belief in the business, the belief in the ability that where we can grow this business, that these per capitas are nowhere near to the ceiling. And the belief that the inspiration is resonating, the marketing combined with execution will resonate and translate into a growth algorithm. It starts with that and I think there's great learnings not just from Latin America execution and family-owned bottling business or even larger bottling businesses in America but across many parts of the world, whether it's in European Coca-Cola Hellenic territories, whether it's in Turkey and CCI territories, whether it's in some other territories in South Europe, Iberian Peninsula. There's that philosophy of execution that was lost and to many, to a great deal, extend to the United Stated and that's coming back. It's coming back rapidly and I think that's what gives us excitement about the future of our business here. Now in terms of your question related to Latin America per se, and yes, we're very happy with our performance in Latin America both this past quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis. And again, it's a great portfolio of countries. You've seen Brazil slow down a little bit, naturally, because we were cycling a very high number from prior year, at 13%. But I think, also at the same time, other countries are coming back to generate a very healthy result overall in our Latin American business. And I've also said this before and I want to reiterate, we're just starting with our Still Beverage business in Latin America. It's just the beginning of the journey and it's still at very low per caps and very low beginnings and there's a great future. As we continue to maintain the momentum in our Sparkling Beverage business in Latin America, the Still Beverage business, that growth is just going to come on top of that and that's what I think what we're building rapidly in Latin America both in our juice and juice drinks business but also in our teas and Leaos, and other such still beverages."

We totally, respectfully disagree that that's very far from where our mind is about the United States. And there's a number of reasons why we believe that. First, the demographics in North America are in our favor. They're the best demographic of any Western nation in the world. We're going to be adding between now and then, of our vision term, 30 million people to the population of the United States. It'll have the third highest teen population. Everyone that has bet against the United States in the past have lost and I respectfully believe, very much so, that we'll get it right also from a macro perspective here. For the diversity of our population, the entrepreneurial spirit, the amount of university graduates that we attract from all around the world, the best. And so we have every reason to believe that this business -- that if we can't grow, it's our fault. Simple as that. And we won't accept that. And therefore, we are growing and we will continue to grow. We never said they we're going to grow at rates of China or India. We said that we'll generate moderate growth rates in America and that we will continue to improve our business and generate higher revenue than our volume and generate higher income than our revenue.

Depending on FX to support your brands is like taking off in a plane with the fuel gauge on. You can't do that. So you've got to make absolutely sure that you have a sustainable base that you can depend on to fuel your brands. And our transformation program, which is ahead of schedule and the last year that we've generated north of $500 million of savings. We've obviously channeled some of that into our brands to continue to fuel our brands. We have also -- are very ahead of our target of schedule in our North American integration. And so the volatility of currency is something that changes faster than -- the rate of change of currencies is something that we haven't seen for a long time. And you cannot depend on that for ensuring that you have enough fuel for your brands. So we have other means to ensure that we have -- that we can continue to support our brands. And by the way, the cash position of our bottlers is better than ever before. And we continue to upgrade and increase and enhance our long-term investment programs that we've announced across the world. I was in China recently, again, where we announced a new investment program and actually when you -- when we conclude the 3-year investment program, we ended up spending more than we originally estimated in China for the 3 years gone back, the last 3 years. And that's because of our bottlers' belief in the future of the business. And that's happening across the world, so we have -- our bottlers financial and balance sheets are better than we've seen them for a long, long time. That fuels more investment in both plant equipment machinery, cold drink, and infrastructure. And we are certainly, reallocating money from our P&L into brand building in a very successful and meaningful and sustainable way."

value, and would give us a benefit.

But the dollar's overvalued but it's overvalued because of fear, right now, in the financial markets. So with that said, long-term I think we probably benefit. Short-term, it probably hurts a little bit. But also said, I think we're seeing offsets across commodities as well. So we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes.

That included a new architecture of packaging and pricing that would make it more attractive, for on-the-go consumers to find packages that were affordable for them, and we did that in China and successfully in parts of Asia successfully, in many parts of Eurasia as we did here in America. And I think it's worked and you heard me just announced also that we'll be launching even more new on-the-go packages here in the United States. So this strategy of investment ahead of the curve in infrastructure, particularly in cold drink infrastructure, coupled with the intelligent progressive packaging moves, have helped us in this area and will continue to help us. And then lay on top of that also some innovative moves like the expansion of Freestyle across -- and Freestyle is now in 2 markets around the world as we speak, in the United States and Japan, and continuing to create a lot of excitement.

On behalf of our 140,000 associates at The Coca-Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered performance results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the sixth consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. 
We continue to advance our global momentum from a position of real strength, realizing growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. For both the quarter and year-to-date, we once more gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio keeps growing, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. This growth was driven by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. And earlier this month, Interbrand ranked Coke-Cola as the world's most valuable brand for the 12th consecutive year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved these balanced quality results together with our system bottling partners during a time of ongoing global market volatility, which is a testament to our clear and focused vision, our strong brands and our solid execution.  
Over the past few months, we've all seen a downturn in global consumer confidence. At the same time, the last few months have reinforced our belief in the resilience of the global consumer. In our business, we constantly track a number of key metrics. We look at total retail sales by country. We look at sales shifts across retail channels. We look at out of home dining and how many people are on the go. And what we've seen this past quarter is that across the world, nonalcoholic beverages continue to generate increasing demand. The key success factor in this current challenging environment is for businesses small, medium or large to be able to generate sustainable growth. And I'm happy that we're able to continue to crack this much-needed algorithm of growth. In Q3 of 2011, we generated almost 250 million unit cases of incremental growth, excluding cross-license and acquired brands, with nearly 50% of this growth coming from sparkling beverages. Just to give you a perspective, this 250 million unit cases of organic volume growth translates into over $1.7 billion of retail value growth, all in 90 days. For the first 9 months of this year, our organic volume growth was over 820 million unit cases, equivalent to creating another India and Russia combined. This achievement of growth is the combined result of precise and focused execution by our inspired system in each quarter combined with the targeted investments made by our system a year or in some cases 2 years prior to the quarter which is being reported.
So while we all see volatility in the external environment and have every reason to believe that this volatility will remain through the near-term, the assumptions that guided the development of our 2020 Vision still ring true. As we complete the seventh quarter in our 2020 Vision, we see a world where population keeps growing at a very rapid rate, up 200 million since just 2008. At the same time, the world's largest cities are growing and have grown by almost 100 million people in the same period since 2008. And the global middle class is also growing. In fact since 2008, almost 200 million people have newly entered the middle class. We said it when we began our 2020 Vision journey and we say it again right now in 2011, our business was built for times like this. Our business is strong across channels and across consumer age groups. We're well positioned to connect with global consumers who have a greater disposition to shop across multiple retail channels in search of real value. So simply said, we provide consumers with an affordable luxury as they enjoy moments of pleasure for pennies at a time, billions of times every day. In February of this year during our presentation at CAGNY, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, we told you that when you have a consistent vision, a consistent belief in your brand, a consistent ethic of execution, the result is consistent quality performance. And while we may see an occasional bump along the road in a given quarter, every year since 2006 we've delivered volume and operating income growth in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. We said this again at CAGNY back in February, that this trend remains true today. All of our attributes, a well-aligned bottling franchise system, healthy brands, strong financial performance and a clear 2020 Vision have put us in a position of real strength as we push ahead towards 2020. And that's why even during times of ongoing global market uncertainty, The Coca-Cola Company keeps delivering consistent top line and bottom line results.
So let's review this quarter's results. We grew worldwide volume 5% this quarter and 6% year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong volume growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date ahead of our long-term growth target. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 12% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, also above our long-term growth targets.
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. Many of you on today's call have listened in or joined us last month in Houston for our investor event and market tour. You heard and saw firsthand how we are building our capabilities to drive our performance in North America. This quarter's results underscored the good progress we are making on this journey. North America reported volume up 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, making this North America's sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Our organic volume growth in North America was up 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In this past quarter, our North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic beverages, reaffirming our commitment to drive balanced growth across our portfolio.
Our sparkling beverages in North America were down only slightly in the quarter with brand Coca-Cola volume even for the quarter, and we clearly outperformed the rest of the industry gaining both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category. And we did so while earning 3% pricing in sparkling beverages this quarter through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies. We are driving profitable growth in North America through our 1.25-liter package which expanded nationally in August and is now available in over 80% of the U.S. supermarkets. In those markets where the 1.25-liter package was first launched in May of this year, we saw the combination of our 1.25-liter and 2-liter package transactions increase this quarter. We're also expanding the availability of our immediate consumption offerings with a new 12.5-ounce handheld PET packaged and a more affordable 7.5-ounce mini-can 8-pack. 
As for Coke Zero, it was up 12% in North America this past quarter, making this its 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digits growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered mid-single digit growth and gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. The leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth in the quarter and is now up 12% on a year-to-date basis. POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category this past quarter. And since July of 2010, POWERADE has added over 5 million new households, demonstrating how this innovative brand keeps resonating with sports drink consumers. 
Our key brands delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit growth for Gold Peak Tea. Finally, as many of you heard during our Houston event last month, our CCR Coca-Cola Refreshments integration is proceeding as planned. We remain confident that we have the right brands, right strategies and right capabilities in place for North America as we continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for our business in this key market. 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are delivering growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. This quarter's results were led by double-digit growth in China, up 11%. Sparkling beverages grew mid-single digits in China this past quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 7%, supported by our strategy to introduce a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio. Last quarter we said this emphasis on single-serve packages would increase transactions and build brand equity. In fact, we observed 12% growth in sparkling beverage transactions in China this past quarter, well ahead of sparkling beverage volume growth. This is in line with our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our brands, while better positioning our China sparkling business for long-term sustainable growth.  At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio in China keeps building momentum, up 24% this quarter and 19% year-to-date, led by Minute Maid Pulpy. We're confident that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long term.
Japan's third quarter results were down 3%. We always expected seeing our volumes soften in Japan this quarter as we cycled 11% growth from last year's record hot summer conditions, while also working through the after-effects of the tragic national disaster in March. And that said, Japan's volume results this past quarter were better than we had originally thought, underscoring once again the strength as well as the resilience of our Japanese bottling system. We remain confident in the long-term health of our business in Japan.
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to expand our volume and value share leadership across the region with volume up 7% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 10% on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 6% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date. We gained both volume and value share in Mexico despite new pricing above the current rate of inflation. Our results in Mexico are a great testament to our team's capability to execute occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies that reinforce recruitment, as well as affordability with consumers in this key marketplace. We're also seeing further momentum in our Argentina business, which delivered double-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 11th consecutive quarter there. Finally Brazil volume was up 1%, cycling 13% growth in last year's comparable period. Having said that, our growth in Brazil is ahead of the industry with our business in Brazil gaining share across both sparkling as well as still beverages. This reinforces our confidence that we have the right strategies in place in Brazil to build on our leadership position and keep expanding our share of industry growth in the years ahead.
Brazil also offers a great example of how we partner with local communities during challenging economic times. We recently established a social business program in Brazil called Coletivo that aims to create shared value with communities through our core business activities. And in partnership with local NGOs, we teach entrepreneurship and retailing skills to young adults living in low-income areas supporting their entry into the formal job market.  Coletivo prepares students through 2 months of training to deliver customized business opportunities to small outlets inside their communities. And we're providing a positive economic impact in these areas, while also helping us drive solid business results. And we are in the process of expanding this program across Brazil, for we strongly believe we have a role to play in helping consumers through tough economic times. And through this program we're creating unique value for our brands, our system, as well as local communities. 
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, we are strategically investing for tomorrow across a diverse array of markets while gaining both volume and value share today. Volume in this region grew 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, led by strong results in India, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. India delivered 19% growth in the quarter, making this its 21st consecutive quarter of growth and bringing our year-to-date volume growth to double digits. This quality growth was well balanced across the entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up 19% this quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola's strong double-digit growth up 17%. And still beverages in India were up 17% again in the quarter, benefiting from healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including brand Maaza, up 19%.  Turkey was up double digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, gaining volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. And Turkey is benefiting from our investments in cold drink equipment, which is increasing cold beverage availability for us in this key market.  
Russia was down mid-single digits this past quarter, cycling very strong 30% growth from the same period last year. At the same time, our business in Russia outperformed the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share in the process. And as you may have heard, we recently announced together with our bottling partners Coca-Cola Hellenic a new Russian investment program of $3 billion over the next 5 years starting in 2012, underscoring our commitment to invest in Russia for the long-term growth. Finally, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 9% growth in the quarter, as we strengthened our position in this key region.
Let me now move to Europe, a part of the world that faced an increasingly volatile economic environment, as well as unseasonably cold weather this past quarter. Despite the challenges, we gained volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and volume also grew slightly in the quarter rounding to even, making this Europe's fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth. And our year-to-date results in Europe are up 2%. Our growth in Europe continues to be led by Germany, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our business in Germany gained volume and value share in sparkling and in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages segment. Our sparkling beverage growth in Germany was led by Coca-Cola, up 5% for the quarter as a result of our strategic focus on recruiting both lapsed consumers and a whole new generation of new consumers. 
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our progress around winning at the point-of-sale by driving immediate consumption growth. Year-to-date, we are sustaining our strong momentum against this priority with immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. Last quarter, we shared that each of our geographic operating groups was growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business. Today, we can further confirm that 17 of our top 22 markets are also growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. In fact, 9 of these markets are growing immediate consumption ahead of future consumption. This is quite an accomplishment in an economic environment which favors faster growth in at-home consumption. As the world's population and demographics keep growing and evolving, our system is focused on capturing more than our fair share of this highly profitable immediate consumption growth. 
In closing, I'd like to say that we're advancing our momentum during a time of mixed economic recovery. Back in 2008 and 2009 when the world's financial markets were unraveling, our system committed to doing 3 things. First, we made a commitment to invest through the crisis. We did so by establishing a clear and focused 2020 Vision that called for investing in consumer marketing and sales and distribution with the mission of becoming the leader in every market in every category of value to us. 
Second, we made a commitment to focus on the marketplace and to ensure that we have the right packages and price points for every occasion, including affordable entry packs for every consumer. And thirdly, we made a commitment to never let short-term considerations cloud our view of the long-term value of our business. As a result of these commitments, our system has never been stronger. We continue to solidify our leadership within the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry and during 2009 and '10, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented nearly 50% of total industry growth, well above our fair share. So in short, our 2020 Vision is working. Yet every one of us here at The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system know that we are really just getting started. All of us remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future; a future filled with abundant opportunities. Our job as stewards of this great business and as caretakers of your investment is to ensure that we keep advancing our system's momentum. With our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we are confident that we can sustainably achieve our long-term growth target and enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,140213089,173330,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mix",1240,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter, up 12% versus prior year. That brings year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, ahead of our long-term growth target. For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 21%, including a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This increases our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 17%, including a 5% currency benefit offset by commodity headwinds.  
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 45% this quarter, including a 5% increase in constant rate sales, a 5% currency benefit, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth remains at 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, 5% benefit from currency, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. 
Our combined international and Bottling Investments Group's price mix for the quarter was a positive 2%. As for North America, we discussed in our last earnings call our plans to implement incremental pricing programs with many of our customers this quarter. As a result, our pricing to retailers in North America was up 2% in the quarter. And as Muhtar mentioned, this quarter's results was driven by a 3% increase in our pricing to retailers for our North American sparkling beverages. As such, our 2011 North American pricing strategy remains on track to earn between 2% and 3% for the full year, leveraging both rate and mix levers to earn price at a premium to our industry. As we continue to grow in North America through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies, which we shared with many of you last month during our investor event and market tour in Houston. If you were not in Houston with us last month or were unable to view the live webcast of our event, we encourage you to visit our website where all videos and presentations from Houston detailing our North American roadmap for growth have been posted.
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 42% in the quarter and 46% year-to-date. As explained in previous quarterly calls, this increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we will cycle in the fourth quarter of this year. It also reflects our continued investments around the world. Year-to-date direct marketing expenses are growing slightly ahead of unit cases as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. As we communicated last quarter, we expect our full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investments Group and even for the full year for our international operations as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets around the world. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations came in at $6.8 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year. Net of the additional pension plan contributions, our cash flow from operations are up 5% year-to-date.
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook for commodities and currencies. First, we've effectively leveraged retail pricing increases and the acceleration of cost saving initiatives to help offset this year's rising commodity cost. Having said that, our incremental cost estimate for 2011 now stands at approximately $800 million, ahead of the $700 million we indicated in our previous calls. Second, since our last earnings call in July of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening against many key currencies. We have hedged positions in place for most key currencies for the remainder of this year. We now expect currencies to adversely impact our fourth quarter operating income by low- to mid-single digits, while still providing a low- to mid-single digit positive impact for the full year. As we planned for 2012, we are looking at our combined exposure across both currencies and commodities. We anticipate that both items will keep moving in opposite directions next year, much like they have this year. And while we expect this movement to help partially offset each other's impact over the course of 2012, the timing of their respective impact on our results will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. As for our normal practice, we'll provide a broader outlook on their expected impact on our 2012 full year results during our next earnings call in February. 
Now let me take a moment to update you on several other programs and line items. Our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008 remain on track to exceed the upper end of our original target of $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of this year. As for synergies related to our CCE transaction, we still expect to deliver between $140 million and $150 million of net call synergies in 2011. With regards to our share repurchase program, on a year-to-date basis, our net share repurchases stand at $2.2 billion. As such, we're now increasing our share repurchase program with a plan to purchase at least 2.5 billion to 3 billion in net shares this year. As for net interest income, our current forecast for the full year is at the high end of our previously communicated range of $30 million to $40 million. This implies a slight net interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year. And our underlying effective tax rate stands at 24%. 
Finally, we want to remind you that this is the last quarter in which we're cycling the acquisition of CCE's former North American business. That said, there were several one-time items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to this acquisition that will continue to impact the comparability of both our as-reported and ongoing recurring results next quarter. We refer you to our previous comments regarding those one-time items, specifically to our modeling call held last year on December 14. The transcript and webcast of that call can be found on our investor website and of course Jackson and our Investor Relations team will be happy to follow up with you separately if you have any further questions.
In closing, we're greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. In the face of today's volatile market conditions our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our flexible and nimble growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. In fact, The Coca-Cola Company has a long history of distributing dividends, having paid them consecutively every year since 1920 and increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years. With our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners, we're confident that we'll keep taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision.

But what I'd like to say is that still I believe that the challenging areas are going to be certainly the Western markets, primarily I believe the U.S. environment as well as the European environment -- Western European environment is still going to be challenging, as challenging as the past 9 months and into the full year, this year probably. And in that environment, we're delivering positive results because our strategies are working, because of our past investments and how we execute against our vision, strength of our brands. We're gaining market share and I think when you look at our broad-based investment programs that we have announced, multiyear investment programs that we have announced whether they're in the Pacific in places like Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam or whether they're in Eurasia and Africa, like India and Pakistan and Africa and the recent Russian investment that I announced when I was there 2 weeks ago in operating a plant in Rostov in the southern part of Russia with our Hellenic bottling partners or whether investments, multi-year investments in Mexico, Brazil, these total over $25 billion and you have these investments that are working for us despite the challenging environment, despite the confused consumer and despite the fact that the general environment is certainly much worse than ideal. However, I think that there will still be areas of growth in the world that we are going to materially benefit from in Africa, where our system is very strong, in Asia and Middle East and Eurasia where our system is very strong and in Latin America. And we will continue to re-architect our brand-priced pack channel offering both here and the United States as well as across the world just like we did in China, just like we did across many other parts of the world to ensure that we can still crack that code for growth on a sustainable basis. And we believe that we can continue to deliver growth in line with our long-term strategies. And yes, there may be a bump along the way in a quarter sometimes. But over the longer period and over the medium and longer period we believe, despite the economic conditions in the world that are much less than ideal, we believe we can continue to crack that algorithm for growth as we move forward."

We also grew sparkling volume and value share and maintained still volume share for the overall group -- the European group. And again reported net revenue for the quarter and I think that was a performance that we were pleased with, given the conditions in Europe. And over Central and Southern Europe, volume declined. And I think the Eastern Central European area was still challenging and South East Europe, particularly also in Italy and Greece. But I believe overall, the portfolio worked for us like it did in the previous quarters in this year, and I believe that's what's going to continue to work for us as we move into the fourth quarter and the final quarter of this year as well as into next year. Brands are stronger than ever before. We're gaining market share and we have many innovations that are working for us in both packaging as well as in the still beverage portfolio area. And our marketing is working for us and next year we've got European championships, which is a Coca-Cola property as you know and we're going to leverage that in a very significant manner.

Number one was the volatility, I'm not sure I can give you a prediction on 2012 and it really mean anything. But the other, and I said a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, what we're seeing is not a direct correlation but a lot of correlation between currencies and commodities. And so every time you see a big spike in the strength of the dollar, you see commodities come off strongly and vice versa. So we're starting to see a natural hedge in offsets in the portfolio of currencies and commodities and we're looking at those together, and then looking at how we hedge them for the best results.

So we've done a good job. In fact, what I said on pricing in North America, we pointed out that pricing was plus 2 in North America, but plus 3 on Sparkling. And in fact, we're cycling -- this is a good news, bad news thing, so let me kind of go through it so you understand it. What we got is very good positive mix, particularly around packaging and you saw a lot of packaging initiatives in Houston. We've also got a negative mix in North America related to the DASANI. And this is actually good news, but at first blush you would think well negative, negative price mix on DASANI. What it is really where the PlantBottle has come through, with our customers really identifying it with it and our consumers and DASANI being relisted in quite a few national retailers. So it's really been a huge positive for us even though it put a little pressure on the price mix in the quarter. So it's a real positive."

The philosophy, the belief in the business, the belief in the ability that where we can grow this business, that these per capitas are nowhere near to the ceiling and the belief that the inspiration is resonating, the marketing combined with execution will resonate and translate into a growth algorithm. It starts with that and I think there's great learnings not just from Latin America execution and family-owned bottling business or even larger bottling businesses in Latin America, but across many parts of the world whether it's in European Coca-Cola Hellenic territories, whether it's in Turkey and CCI territories, whether it's in some other territories in South Europe, Iberian Peninsula. There's that philosophy of execution that was lost to many to a great deal that extends to the United Stated and that's coming back.

And I've also said this before and I want to reiterate, we're just starting with our Still Beverage business in Latin America. It's just the beginning of the journey and it's still at very low per caps and very low beginnings and there's a great future. As we continue to maintain the momentum in our Sparkling Beverage business in Latin America, the Still Beverage business, that growth is just going to come on top of that and that's what I think what we're building rapidly in Latin America both in our juice and juice drinks business, but also in our teas and Leaos, and other such still beverages."

And it's really important to underscore that point that we are growing. So we have no reason to put our hands up, as you suggest. We totally, respectfully disagree that that's very far from where our mind is about the United States. And there's a number of reasons why we believe that. First, the demographics in North America are in our favor. They're the best demographics of any Western nation in the world. We're going to be adding between now and then of our vision term, 30 million people to the population of the United States. It'll have the third highest teen population. Everyone that has bet against the United States in the past have lost and I respectfully believe, very much so, that we'll get it right also from a macro perspective here. For the diversity of our population, the entrepreneurial spirit, the amount of university graduates that we attract from all around the world, the best. And so we have every reason to believe that this business -- that if we can't grow, it's our fault. Simple as that. And we won't accept that. And therefore, we are growing and we will continue to grow. We never said they we're going to grow at rates of China or India. We said that we'll generate moderate growth rates in America and that we will continue to improve our business and generate higher revenue than our volume and generate higher income than our revenue. So volume, moderate volume, better than the volume revenues and better than revenue income. That's our model, and we believe that, that model will work."

So you've got to make absolutely sure that you have a sustainable base that you can depend on to fuel your brands.

We've obviously channeled some of that into our brands to continue to fuel our brands. We have also -- are very ahead of our target of schedule in our North American integration and so the volatility of currency is something that changes faster than -- the rate of change of currencies is something that we haven't seen for a long time, and you cannot depend on that for ensuring that you have enough fuel for your brands. So we have other means to ensure that we have -- that we can continue to support our brands. And by the way, the cash position of our bottlers is better than ever before. And we continue to upgrade and increase and enhance our long-term investment programs that we've announced across the world. I was in China recently again where we announced a new investment program and actually when you -- when we concluded the 3-year investment program, we ended up spending more than we originally estimated in China for the 3 years gone back, the last 3 years. And that's because of our bottlers' belief in the future of the business. And that's happening across the world, so we have -- our bottlers financial and balance sheets are better than we've seen them for a long, long time. That fuels more investment in both plant equipment, machinery, cold drink and infrastructure and we are certainly reallocating money from our P&L into brand building in a very successful and meaningful and sustainable way."

But the dollar's overvalued, but it's overvalued because of fear right now in the financial markets. So with that said, long-term I think we probably benefit. Short-term, it probably hurts us a little bit. But also said, I think we're seeing offsets across commodities as well. So we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes.

That included a new architecture of packaging and pricing that would make it more attractive for on-the-go consumers to find packages that were affordable for them, and we did that in China and successfully in parts of Asia successfully, in many parts of Eurasia as we did here in America. And I think it's worked and you heard me just announce also that we'll be launching even more new on-the-go packages here in the United States. So this strategy of investment ahead of the curve in infrastructure, particularly in cold drink infrastructure, coupled with the intelligent progressive packaging moves, have helped us in this area and will continue to help us. And then lay on top of that also some innovative moves like the expansion of Freestyle across -- and Freestyle is now in 2 markets around the world as we speak, in the United States and Japan, and continuing to create a lot of excitement.
