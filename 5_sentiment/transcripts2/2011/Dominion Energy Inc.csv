As anyone fami",1376,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest and merging risk of acquiring other utilities. As anyone familiar with our company knows, Dominion has a very strong organic growth plan. We are investing over $2 billion a year on growth projects across all of our regulated lines of business. Achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth target does not depend on our ability to make the acquisitions. If we were to considering an M&A transaction, it would have to be a unique opportunity that will not weaken our financial conditions and will be accretive to earnings per share and shareholder values.
Now turning to 2010. 2010 was an extraordinary year for Dominion. We made significant progress on our strategic plan and demonstrated how our infrastructure growth plan will continue for at least the next five years. Our Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratios to be more in line with our more regulated peers. Last month, the board authorized a 7.7% increase in the dividend to an annual rate of $1.97 per share. Also, our total shareholder return for the year was strong.
We began the year with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia Power which maintains current best rates to at least 2013 and enables the company to earn competitive rates of return and support our infrastructure growth program. This was the first base rate case of the company under Virginia's new regulatory structure. We have since joined other parties in submitting a proposal to the commission which calls for the terms of the settlement to be extended for an additional year through a referral of the first Pioneer review until 2012. The so-called staggering of the Pioneer review process was provided for in the 2007 de-regulation law. If referred by the commission, the first Pioneer review will cover results for 2010 and 2011. And no change in the base rates could occur before December 2014.
The return on equity will continue to be 11.9% with a 50 basis point color in the return of equity for the Raid Riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden generating plants will continue to be 12.3% for at least an additional year. While we are on the subject of regulation during 2010, we also secured our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. The settlement agreement in that proceeding will increase annual non-fuel-based revenues by $7.7 million and allow for a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses to be recovered through the fuel box rather than base rates. We also advanced our strategic plan in March and we sold our Appalachian E&P business to CONSOL with $3.475 billion. This transaction enables us to capture the value of our acreage in the Marcellus formation and significantly reduce our commodity price exposure. We used the proceeds from the sale to offset our equity needs, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and buy back common stock. One of the reasons for the sale was to focus on our investment capital towards developing the new infrastructure that will be necessary for the Marcellus region to develop. Since closing on the sale, we have announced four new Marcellus related growth projects. New projects such as the Marcellus 404 and the Northeast Expansion continue to move forward and are expected to contribute to earnings growth over the next five years. You can expect announcements of additional projects as the build out of the Marcellus region continuous.
Growth in our natural gas businesses is not just about the Marcellus development. Our Appalachian gateways gathering expansion projects represented about $900 million of new infrastructure that will come in to service over the next two years. We're also pursuing an acceleration of the Barefield steel pipe replacement program at Dominion East Ohio. Finally during the fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with our customer in the Cove Point expansion to shorten our contracts from 18 years to 10, which positions us to explore options to develop liquefaction capabilities at the site. A potential interest in such a facility would be limited to the infrastructure and not the commodity. The construction of the new electric generation capacity in Virginia is a key component of our strategic plan. Virginia continues to be the second-largest importer of power in the country.
The latest load forecast from PJM supports the need for at least 4500 megawatts of new capacity over just the next 10 years. Also during the year, we made significant progress on the construction of two new power stations, bear Garden and the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Bear Garden is expected to be in service during the second quarter of this year and Virginia City is expected to begin service during the summer of 2012. The next phase of our generation expansion plan also came into focus during 2010. We are proceeding with the development of a power station in Warren County Virginia with about 1300 megawatts of generating capacity. This natural gas power plant will utilize the 3-on-1 combined cycle technology and will be one of the most efficient gas powered units in the country. We received the final air permit for the project in December and we'll file for a CPCN and rate router for Warren County with the State Corporation Commission early next quarter.
As part of the air permit process, we reached an agreement with the National Park Service to close our North branch power station. The small 74-megawatt coal plant located in West Virginia. Our two major electric transmission projects, the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk line are also nearing the incompletion. At our May 7 analyst meeting, we outlined our next major transmission project, the Mt. Storm-Doubs line. That project received approval from PJM in December. The West Virginia Commission has already ruled but no filings are required to reconductor the line.
We will begin road in Cower foundation work in West Virginia this Spring. Last week, we filed for approval from the Virginia State Corporation commission to reconductor the Virginia portion of the line. Now Storm and Dobbs is the next step in what would be a multiyear debt upgrade of the 500 KB transmission loop that forms the backbone of our region's electric transmission system.
We also continue to optimize the value of our merchant-generating portfolio. During 2010, we installed a new economizer at Brayton Point Unit 3 which will improve the reliability and efficiency of that unit. We also reached an agreement to sell the development rights to Phase IV of the Fowler Ridge win facility to VP and are in the process of divesting our interest in the Morgantown Energy Center. 
2010 was an exceptional year for our operating performance as well. We experienced a record snowfall early in the year in one of the hottest summers on record. Despite these challenges, we continued to improve our safety performance and service reliability, even with the midyear voluntary separation program, which reduced our workforce by 7%. All three operating business units recorded the best safety performance in the history, an achievement for which we are proud but not satisfy.
2010, marked the seventh year in a row where generations nuclear fleet capacity factor exceeded 90%. Our nuclear upgrade projects added a more than 85 megawatts to our summer capability. Fossil & Hydro's combined fleet achieved a new record Equivalent Forced Outage rate of 3.9% during 2010. Virginia Power Fossil fleet did achieve a new record at 2.9%. Our electric transmission and distribution group improved this three-year rolling average reliability measure by 3% in 2010 compared to '09 and a 12% improvement over 2006. We made significant improvements in our responsiveness to our customer inquiries as well. Dominion East Ohio replaced over 250,000 meters under the AMR rider program last year. It also invested over $108 million to replace bare steel pipeline under the PIR wire program. In conclusion, I believe that from both the strategic and operational point of view, 2010 was an outstanding year for Dominion. I will now turn the call over to Mark, who will review our financial review results."

Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong.

Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% up of our operating earnings for 2009. Favorable weather and higher rates adjustment clause revenues were the principal positive factors influenced in the earnings. Our interest expense were also lower than expected as lower cash flow reduced our need for external debt financing. Partially offsetting these factors were lower margins from our merchant generation fleet and the absence of earnings from our previously owned Appalachian E&P business.
We produce operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.63 per share, the level with last year's fourth quarter and near the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings were $0.43 per share for the fourth quarter, and $4.68 per share for the year. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the year were a gain on the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations, the cost of the workforce reduction program, a charge related to the discontinued operations at Peoples Gas and impairment charges on certain merchant generation assets.
A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on schedules two and three of our earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for 2010 was $891 million, near the midpoint of our original guidance range of $866 million to $930 million. The benefits of favorable weather and our regulated service territory, were largely offset by major storm and service restoration costs and other investments to improve reliability.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $862 million, compared to our original guidance range of $852 million to $894 million. Lower fuel costs for Dominion Gas transmission were partially offset by a lower contribution from Producer Services.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $2.3 billion for 2010, above the high end of our original guidance range. Favorable weather in our regulated electric service area more than offset cost from investments made to improve reliability. Overall, we were very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our Earnings Call. These supplemental schedules showed quarterly and annual EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations. As well as quarterly and annual EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. The company generated very strong cash flow last year because of both good results from operations and from divestiture activities, enabling us to fund our CapEx program, invest on our pension plan, reduce debt and repurchase common stock. Liquidity at the end of the year was $2 billion. Our liquidity each declined significantly when we sold our E&P business. You may recall that in September, we replaced and resized our credit commitments down to $3.5 billion. We are very comfortable with this new capacity level given our current and potential liquidity requirements. For statement of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of our earnings release kit.
We can't talk about our financing plan for the next years without first discussing the impact of the bonus depreciation provision in the recent tax bills enacted by Congress. Many of the capital projects we have underway qualify for bonus depreciation. Although there is still as to whether some projects qualify for 50% or 100% depreciation.
Our best estimate at this time is that the cash benefit will be between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion through 2013. We have already used a portion of the cash benefit to make a contribution to the dimension Dominion pension plan, and we will use future benefits to buy back common stock and afford debt, otherwise would've been issued over the next three years. As you know, there's a negative side to bonus depreciation. The deferred taxes that have created as a result of this accelerated depreciation will reduce our rate base and it will reduce or eliminate the 199 or manufacturing tax deduction. The share repurchases and earnings benefit of potential contribution should offset all the negative impacts for 2011 and most of the expected impact for 2012 and beyond.
Now moving to our financing plan for this year. Recall that our previous plan, which developed was prior to the extension of bonus depreciation did not include any equity in 2011. With the benefits of bonus depreciation, we now plan to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity this year. On the debt side, we plan to issue between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of that this year, including the funding of about $500 million in maturities.
While the financing plan for 2012 is far from completed at this early date, we have determined that we do not need to have a market issue of common stock in 2012 and were determined at a later date to issue new shares or use market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and other plant requirements.
We have already used $400 million of the bonus depreciation tax savings to make a contribution to our pension plans. Dominion's pension plans is very much well-funded for quite some time and is funding levels rank among the strongest not only in the industry but the entire Fortune 500. With this latest contribution, Dominion pension plans have a funded ratio of 116% on a combined basis.
Now to full year and first quarter 2011 earnings guidance. Our guidance range for operating earnings for the full year of 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. More details regarding our 2011 guidance can be found in the guidance kit that will be available on our website later today. The principal negative driver to 2011 earnings compared to 2010 is lower realized margins from our merchant fleet due to a lower commodity prices and higher plant outage expenses. Other negative factors including return to normal weather and our regulated service territory and a higher effective tax rate due to the decrease or elimination of the manufacturing deduction.
Factors somewhat offsetting these negatives include higher elect sales growth to match with the recovering economy, higher revenues from our various rider projects and lower utility outage cost. We have been saying for sometime the 2011 represents the year in which our commodity sensitive earnings bottom out. We still expect to achieve the previously forecasted 5% to 6% growth in earnings per share beginning in 2012. Dominion expects first quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.96 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the prior year include higher rider revenues and lower storm restoration expenses. Factors offsetting these positives include a return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher interest expenses. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.29 per share. For our reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP, please refer to our GAAP reconciliations schedules contained in our earnings release kit.
As to hedging, we've added to our hedged positions at Millstone, increasing coverage of expected increasing output to 70% for 2012. Our New England coal units, our hedged position was unchanged from the prior quarter. We also increased our hedged position at Stateline to 77% for 2011, and 76% for 2012. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in the England powered prices is now approximately $0.02 per share.
Our sensitivity for 2012 is now only $0.05 per share. In addition, we've nearly reached our maximum hedged position for frac spreads each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedged positions can be found on Page 32 of our earnings release kit. Our hedged positions, coupled with current forward prices in a regulated growth plan, support our 5% to 6% earnings growth rate beginning in 2012.
So let me summarize my financial review. First, we have achieved all of our important operational, strategic and financial goals in 2010. Second, our 2011 operating earnings range, guidance range remains unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. Third, we expect that the cash impact of bonus depreciation will eliminate our need for multi issuance of common stock for the next two years. Forth, we intend to mitigate the E&P impact of bonus depreciation through share repurchases and reduce debt issuances. And finally, we have secured hedges on our merchant fleet with the support for earnings guidance and growth targets. We believe that our regulated growth plan, coupled with and expected total dividend increase of nearly 15% over the next two years, position us to provide strong returns for our shareholders. Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Bear Garden, our gas facility closes this year over $600 million. Brayton Point cooling towers will come in this year and that. So depending if they get 50% or 100% bonus depreciation, that's the reason for the wide range. I would said that the main drivers in terms of the businesses that I would see a rate based are really based on the riders in Virginia for Beechach and Bear Garden, as well as for the two large transmission projects.

I think the question will be based on the final rules which should be available in the next several months will that number approach to the top of the range part will stay at the 1.6 billion."

While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone f",1381,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone familiar with our company knows, Dominion has a very strong organic growth plan. We are investing over $2 billion a year on growth projects across all of our regulated lines of business. Achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth target does not depend on our ability to make the acquisitions. If we were to consider an M&A transaction, it would have to be a unique opportunity that would not weaken our financial condition and will be accretive to earnings per share and shareholder value.
Now turning to 2010. 2010 was an extraordinary year for Dominion. We made significant progress on our strategic plan and demonstrated how our infrastructure growth plan will continue for at least the next five years. Our Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratio to be more in line with our more regulated peers. Last month, the Board authorized a 7.7% increase in the dividend to an annual rate of $1.97 per share. Also, our total shareholder return for the year was strong.
We began the year with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia Power that maintains current base rates through at least 2013 and enables the company to earn a competitive rates of return that support our infrastructure growth program. This was the first base rate case for the company under Virginia's new regulatory structure. We have since joined other parties in submitting a proposal to the Commission, which calls for the terms of the settlement to be extended for an additional year through a deferral of the first biennial review until 2012. The so-called staggering of the biennial review process was provided for in the 2007 Reregulation Law. If approved by the Commission, the first biennial review will cover results for 2010 and 2011. And no change in base rates could occur before December 2014.
The return on equity will continue to be 11.9% with a 50 basis point color in the return on equity for the rate riders for the Virginia City, and Bear Garden generating plants will continue to be 12.3% for at least an additional year. While we are on the subject of regulation during 2010, we also secured our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. The settlement agreement in that proceeding will increase annual non-fuel base revenues by $7.7 million and allow for a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses to be recovered through the fuel clause rather than base rates. 
We also advanced our strategic plan in March when we sold our Appalachian E&P business to CONSOL for $3.475 billion. This transaction enable us to capture the value of our acreage in the Marcellus formation and significantly reduce our commodity price exposure. We used the proceed from the sale to offset our equity needs, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and buy back common stock. One of the reasons for the sale was to focus our investment capital towards developing the new infrastructure that will be necessary for the Marcellus region to develop. Since closing on the sale, we have announced four new Marcellus-related growth projects. New projects, such as the Marcellus 404 and the Northeast Expansion, continue to move forward and are expected to contribute to earnings growth over the next five years. You can expect announcements of additional projects as the build out of the Marcellus region continues.
Growth in our natural gas businesses is not just about the Marcellus development. Our Appalachian Gateway and Gathering Expansion projects represent about $900 million of new infrastructure that will come in to service over the next two years. We're also pursuing an acceleration of the bare steel pipe replacement program at Dominion East Ohio. Finally during the fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with our customer in the Cove Point Expansion to shorten our contracts from 18 years to 10, which positions us to explore options to develop liquefaction capabilities at the site. A potential interest in such a facility would be limited to the infrastructure and not the commodity. The construction of the new electric generating capacity in Virginia is a key component of our strategic plan. Virginia continues to be the second-largest importer of power in the country. The latest load forecast from PJM supports the need for at least 4,500 megawatts of new capacity over just the next 10 years. 
Also during the year, we made significant progress on the construction of two new power stations, Bear Garden and the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Bear Garden is expected to be in service during the second quarter of this year, and Virginia City is expected to be in service during the summer of 2012. The next phase of our generation expansion plan also came into focus during 2010. We are proceeding with development of the power station in Warren County, Virginia, with about 1,300 megawatts of generating capacity. This natural gas power plant will utilize the three-on-one combined cycle technology and will be one of the most efficient gas powered units in the country. We received the final air permit for the project in December. And we'll file for a CPCN and rate rider for Warren County with the State Corporation Commission early next quarter.
As part of the air permit process, we reached an agreement with the National Park Service to close our North Branch Power Station, the small 74-megawatt coal plant located in West Virginia. Our two major electric transmission projects, the Meadow Brook to Loudoun and Carson to Suffolk lines are also nearing completion. At our May 7 analyst meeting, we outlined our next major transmission project, the Mount Storm to Doubs line. That project received approval from PJM in December. The West Virginia Commission has already ruled that no filings are required to reconductor the line.
We will begin road and tower foundation work in West Virginia this Spring. Last week, we filed for approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission to reconductor the Virginia portion of the line. Mount Storm to Doubs is the next step in what will be a multiyear depth upgrade of the 500 kV transmission loop that forms the backbone of our region's electric transmission system.
We also continue to optimize the value of our merchant generating portfolio. During 2010, we installed a new economizer at Brayton Point Unit 3, which will improve the reliability and efficiency of that unit. We also reached an agreement to sell the development rights of Phase IV of the Fowler Ridge wind facility to VP, and are in the process of divesting our interest in the Morgantown Energy Center. 
2010 was an exceptional year for our operating performance as well. We experienced a record snowfall early in the year and one of the hottest summers on record. Despite these challenges, we continue to improve our safety performance and service reliability, even with the midyear voluntary separation program, which reduced our workforce by 7%. All three operating business units recorded their best safety performance in their history, an achievement for which we are proud but not satisfied.
2010 marks the seventh year in a row where generation's nuclear fleet capacity factor exceeded 90%. Our nuclear upgrade projects added more than 85 megawatts to our summer capability. Fossil & Hydro's combined fleet achieved a new record Equivalent Forced Outage rate of 3.9% during 2010. Virginia Power Fossil [ph] fleet did achieve a new record at 2.9%. Our electric transmission and distribution group improved this three-year rolling average reliability measure by 3% in 2010 compared to '09 and a 12% improvement over 2006. We've made significant improvements in our responsiveness to customer inquiries as well. Dominion East Ohio replaced over 250,000 meters under the AMR rider program last year. It also invested over $108 million to replace bare steel pipeline under the PIR rider program. In conclusion, I believe that from both a strategic and operational point of view, 2010 was an outstanding year for Dominion. I will now turn the call over to Mark, who will review our financial results."
267105,118141370,96870,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2011",2011-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009",1500,"Thank you, Tom. Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009. Favorable weather and higher rate adjustment clause revenues were the principal positive factors influenced in the earnings. Our interest expense were also lower than expected as strong cash flow reduced our need for external debt financing. Partially offsetting these factors were lower margins from our merchant generation fleet and the absence of earnings from our previously owned Appalachian E&P business.
We produced operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.63 per share, a level with last year's fourth quarter and near the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings were $0.43 per share for the fourth quarter, and $4.68 per share for the year. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the year were the gain on the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations, the cost of the workforce reduction program, a charge related to the discontinued operations at Peoples Gas and impairment charges on certain merchant generation assets.
A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of our earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for 2010 was $891 million, near the midpoint of our original guidance range of $866 million to $930 million. The benefits of favorable weather in a regulated electric service territory, but largely offset by major storm and service restoration costs and other investments to improve reliability.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $862 million compared to our original guidance range of $852 million to $894 million. Lower fuel costs for Dominion gas transmission were partially offset by a lower contribution from Producer Services.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $2.3 billion for 2010, above the high end of our original guidance range. Favorable weather in a regulated electric service area more than offset cost from investments made to improve reliability. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show a quarterly and annual EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly and annual EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. The company generated very strong cash flow last year because of both good results from operations and from divestiture activities, enabling us to fund our CapEx program, invest on our pension plan, reduce debt and repurchase common stock. Liquidity at the end of the year was $2 billion. Our liquidity needs declined significantly when we sold our E&P business. You may recall that in September, we replaced and resized our credit commitments down to $3.5 billion. We are very comfortable with this new capacity level given our current and potential liquidity requirements. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit.
We can't talk about our financing plan for the next two years without first discussing the impact of the bonus depreciation provision and the recent tax bills enacted by Congress. Many of the capital projects we have underway qualified for bonus depreciation, although there is still ambiguity as to whether some projects qualified for 50% or 100% depreciation.
Our best estimate at this time is that the cash benefit will be between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion through 2013. We have already used a portion of the cash benefit to make a contribution to the Dominion pension plan, and we'll use future benefits to buy back common stock and afford debt that otherwise would've been issued over the next three years. As you know, there's a negative side to bonus depreciation. The deferred taxes that are created as a result of this accelerated depreciation will reduce our rate base, and it will reduce or eliminate the 199 or manufacturing tax deduction. The share repurchases and earnings benefit of the pension contribution should offset all the negative impacts for 2011 and most of the expected impact for 2012 and beyond.
Now moving to our financing plan for this year. Recall that our previous plan, which was developed prior to the extension of bonus depreciation did not include any equity in 2011. With the benefits of bonus depreciation, we now plan to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity this year. On the debt side, we plan to issue between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of debt this year, including the funding of about $500 million in maturities.
While the financing plan for 2012 is far from completed at this early date, we have determined that we do not need to have a market issue of common stock in 2012, and we'll determine at a later date whether to issue new shares or use market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and other plan requirements.
We have already used $400 million of bonus depreciation tax savings to make a contribution to our pension plans. Dominion's pension plans have been very well-funded for quite some time, and its funding levels ranked among the strongest, not only in the industry, but the entire Fortune 500. With this latest contribution, Dominion pension plans had a funded ratio of 116% on a combined basis.
Now to full year and first quarter 2011 earnings guidance. Our guidance range for operating earnings for the full year of 2011 remains at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. More details regarding our 2011 guidance can be found in the guidance kit that will be available on our website later today. The principal negative driver to 2011 earnings compared to 2010 is lower realized margins from our merchant fleet due to lower commodity prices and higher planned outage expenses. Other negative factors include the return to normal weather in a regulated service territory and a higher effective tax rate due to the decrease or elimination of the manufacturing deduction.  Factors somewhat offsetting these negatives, include higher electric sales growth commenced with the recovering economy, higher revenues from our various rider projects and lower utility outage cost. 
We have been saying for sometime the 2011 represents the year in which our commodity sensitive earnings bottom out. We still expect to achieve the previously forecasted 5% to 6% growth in earnings per share beginning in 2012. Dominion expects first quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.96 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011, compared to the prior year, include higher rider revenues and lower storm restoration expenses. Factors offsetting these positives include the return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher interest expenses. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.29 per share. For a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP, please refer to our GAAP reconciliation schedules contained in our earnings release kit.
As to hedging, we've added to our hedge positions at Millstone, increasing coverage of expected output to 70% for 2012. At our New England coal units, our hedge position was unchanged from the prior quarter. We also increased our hedge position at State Line to 77% for 2011, and 76% for 2012. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now approximately $0.02 per share.
Our sensitivity for 2012 is now only $0.05 per share. In addition, we have nearly reached our maximum hedge position for frac spreads each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 32 of our earnings release kit. Our hedge positions, coupled with current forward prices in a regulated growth plan, support our 5% to 6% earnings growth rate beginning in 2012.
So let me summarize my financial review. First, we have achieved all of our important operational, strategic and financial goals in 2010. Second, our 2011 operating earnings range, guidance range remains unchanged at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. Third, we expect that the cash impact of bonus depreciation will eliminate our need for multi-issuance of common stock for the next two years. Fourth, we intend to mitigate the EPS impact of bonus depreciation through share repurchases and reduce debt issuances. And finally, we have secured hedges on our merchant fleet with support or earnings guidance and growth targets. We believe that our regulated growth plan, coupled with and expected total dividend increase of nearly 15% over the next two years, position us to provide strong returns for our shareholders. Thank you. And we are now ready for your questions."

When we get the final clarification on this, we will go ahead and buy business segment showed by the exact impact. But as a general ruling and the reason for the wide range for us is that, as you know, we have several very large projects, and the biggest of which is the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, which is next year at $1.8 billion. Bear Garden, our gas facility closes this year over $600 million. Brayton Point cooling towers will commend this year and next. So depending if they get 50% or 100% bonus depreciation, that's the reason for the wide range. I would say that the main drivers in terms of the businesses that I would see a rate base growth are really based on the riders in Virginia for Beechach and for Bear Garden, as well as for the two large transmission projects. We are very comfortable with the bottom of the range at the 1.6 level. I think the question will be based on the final rules, which should be available in the next several months. Will that number approach to the top of the range part, or will stay at the 1.6 billion?"

The pipe is there, the terminals are there, the logistics appear. If the Marcellus is going to build out the way it is expected, to reach its full potential. People are going to have to explore exportation of the gas. Like the import facility, we won't enter into a speculative capital investment there.

267105,118141370,96981,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2011",2011-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone f",1377,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone familiar with our company knows, Dominion has a very strong organic growth plan. We are investing over $2 billion a year in growth projects across all of our regulated lines of business. Achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets does not depend on our ability to make acquisitions. If we were to consider an M&A transaction, it would have to be a unique opportunity that would not weaken our financial condition and would be accretive to earnings per share and shareholder value.
Now turning to 2010. 2010 was an extraordinary year for Dominion. We made significant progress on our strategic plan and demonstrated how our infrastructure growth plan will continue for at least the next five years. Our Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratios to be more in line with our more regulated peers. Last month, the Board authorized a 7.7% increase in the dividend to an annual rate of $1.97 per share. Also, our total shareholder return for the year was strong.
We began the year with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia Power that maintains current base rates through at least 2013, and enables the company to earn competitive rates of return that support our infrastructure growth program. This was the first base rate case for the company under Virginia's new regulatory structure. We have since joined other parties in submitting a proposal to the Commission, which calls for the terms of the settlement to be extended for an additional year through a deferral of the first biennial review until 2012. This so-called staggering of the biennial review process was provided for in the 2007 Reregulation Law. If approved by the Commission, the first biennial review will cover results for 2010 and 2011. And no change in base rates could occur before December 2014.
The return on equity will continue to be 11.9% with a 50 basis point color in the return on equity for the rate riders for the Virginia City, and Bear Garden generating plants will continue to be 12.3% for at least an additional year. While we are on the subject of regulation during 2010, we also secured our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. The settlement agreement in that proceeding will increase annual non-fuel base revenues by $7.7 million and allow for a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses to be recovered through the fuel clause rather than base rates. 
We also advanced our strategic plan in March when we sold our Appalachian E&P business to CONSOL for $3.475 billion. This transaction enabled us to capture the value of our acreage in the Marcellus formation and significantly reduced our commodity price exposure. We used the proceeds from the sale to offset our equity needs, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and buy back common stock. One of the reasons for the sale was to focus our investment capital towards developing the new infrastructure that will be necessary for the Marcellus region to develop. Since closing on the sale, we have announced four new Marcellus-related growth projects. New projects, such as the Marcellus 404 and the Northeast Expansion continue to move forward and are expected to contribute to earnings growth over the next five years. You can expect announcements of additional projects as the build out of the Marcellus region continues.
Growth in our natural gas businesses is not just about the Marcellus development. Our Appalachian Gateway and Gathering Expansion projects represent about $900 million of new infrastructure that will come into service over the next two years. We're also pursuing an acceleration of the bare steel pipe replacement program at Dominion East Ohio. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with our customer in the Cove Point expansion to shorten our contracts from 18 years to 10, which positions us to explore options to develop liquefaction capabilities at the site. A potential interest in such a facility would be limited to the infrastructure and not the commodity. The construction of the new electric generating capacity in Virginia is a key component of our strategic plan. Virginia continues to be the second-largest importer of power in the country. The latest load forecast from PJM supports the need for at least 4,500 megawatts of new capacity over just the next 10 years. 
Also during the year, we made significant progress on the construction of two new power stations, Bear Garden and the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Bear Garden is expected to be in service during the second quarter of this year, and Virginia City is expected to be in service during the summer of 2012. The next phase of our generation expansion plan also came into focus during 2010. We are proceeding with development of the power station in Warren County, Virginia, with about 1,300 megawatts of generating capacity. This natural gas power plant will utilize the three-on-one combined cycle technology and will be one of the most efficient gas powered units in the country. We received the final air permit for the project in December. And we'll file for a CPCN and rate rider for Warren County with the State Corporation Commission early next quarter.
As part of the air permit process, we reached an agreement with the National Park Service to close our North Branch Power Station, the small 74-megawatt coal plant located in West Virginia. Our two major electric transmission projects, the Meadow Brook to Loudoun and Carson to Suffolk lines are also nearing completion. At our May 7 analyst meeting, we outlined our next major transmission project, the Mount Storm to Doubs line. That project received approval from PJM in December. The West Virginia Commission has already ruled that no filings are required to reconductor the line.
We will begin road and tower foundation work in West Virginia this Spring. Last week, we filed for approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission to reconductor the Virginia portion of the line. Mount Storm to Doubs is the next step in what will be a multiyear depth upgrade of the 500kV transmission loop that forms the backbone of our region's electric transmission system.
We also continue to optimize the value of our merchant generating portfolio. During 2010, we installed a new economizer at Brayton Point Unit 3, which will improve the reliability and efficiency of that unit. We also reached an agreement to sell the development rights of Phase IV of the Fowler Ridge Wind facility to VP, and are in the process of divesting our interest in the Morgantown Energy Center. 
2010 was an exceptional year for our operating performance as well. We experienced a record snowfall early in the year and one of the hottest summers on record. Despite these challenges, we continue to improve our safety performance and service reliability, even with the midyear voluntary separation program, which reduced our workforce by 7%. All three operating business units recorded their best safety performance in their history, an achievement for which we are proud but not satisfied.
2010 marks the seventh year in a row where generation's nuclear fleet capacity factor exceeded 90%. Our nuclear upgrade projects added more than 85 megawatts to our summer capability. Fossil & Hydro's combined fleet achieved a new record Equivalent Forced Outage rate of 3.9% during 2010. Virginia Power fossil fleet did achieve a new record at 2.9%. Our electric transmission and distribution group improved this three-year rolling average reliability measure by 3% in 2010, compared to '09 and a 12% improvement over 2006. We've made significant improvements in our responsiveness to customer inquiries as well. Dominion East Ohio replaced over 250,000 meters under the AMR rider program last year. It also invested over $108 million to replace bare steel pipeline under the PIR rider program. In conclusion, I believe that from both a strategic and operational point of view, 2010 was an outstanding year for Dominion. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark, for a review of our financial results."

Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009",1496,"Thank you, Tom. Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009. Favorable weather and higher rate adjustment clause revenues were the principal positive factors influence in the earnings. Our interest expense were also lower than expected as strong cash flow reduced our need for external debt financing. Partially offsetting these factors were lower margins from our merchant generation fleet and the absence of earnings from our previously owned Appalachian E&P business.
We produced operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.63 per share, level with last year's fourth quarter and near the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings were $0.43 per share for the fourth quarter, and $4.68 per share for the year. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the year were the gain on the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations, the cost of the workforce reduction program, a charge related to the discontinued operations at Peoples Gas and impairment charges on certain merchant generation assets.
A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of our earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for 2010 was $891 million, near the midpoint of our original guidance range of $866 million to $930 million. The benefits of favorable weather in a regulated electric service territory, but largely offset by major storm and service restoration costs and other investments to improve reliability.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $862 million compared to our original guidance range of $852 million to $894 million. Lower fuel costs for Dominion gas transmission were partially offset by a lower contribution from Producer Services.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $2.3 billion for 2010, above the high-end of our original guidance range. Favorable weather in a regulated electric service area more than offset costs from investments made to improve reliability. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show quarterly and annual EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly and annual EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. The company generated very strong cash flow last year because of both good results from operations and from divestiture activities, enabling us to fund our CapEx program, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and repurchase common stock. Liquidity at the end of the year was $2 billion. Our liquidity needs declined significantly when we sold our E&P business. You may recall that in September, we replaced and resized our credit commitments down to $3.5 billion. We are very comfortable with this new capacity level given our current and potential liquidity requirements. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit.
We can't talk about our financing plans for the next few years without first discussing the impact of the bonus depreciation provision and the recent tax bills enacted by Congress. Many of the capital projects we have underway qualify for bonus depreciation, although there is still ambiguity as to whether some projects qualify for 50% or 100% depreciation.
Our best estimate at this time is that the cash benefit will be between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion through 2013. We have already used a portion of the cash benefit to make a contribution to the Dominion pension plan, and we'll use future benefits to buy back common stock and afford debt that otherwise would've been issued over the next three years. As you know, there's a negative side to bonus depreciation. The deferred taxes that are created as a result of this accelerated depreciation will reduce our rate base, and it will reduce or eliminate the 199 or manufacturing tax deduction. The share repurchases and earnings benefit of the pension contribution should offset all the negative impacts for 2011 and most of the expected impact for 2012 and beyond.
Now moving to our financing plan for this year. Recall that our previous plan, which was developed prior to the extension of bonus depreciation did not include any equity in 2011. With the benefits of bonus depreciation, we now plan to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity this year. On the debt side, we plan to issue between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of debt this year, including the funding of about $500 million in maturities.
While the financing plan for 2012 is far from complete at this early date, we have determined that we do not need to have a market issue of common stock in 2012, and we'll determine at a later date whether to issue new shares or use market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and other plan requirements.
We have already used $400 million of bonus depreciation tax savings to make a contribution to our pension plans. Dominion's pension plans have been very well-funded for quite some time, and as funding levels rank among the strongest, not only in the industry, but the entire Fortune 500. With this latest contribution, Dominion pension plans had a funded ratio of 116% on a combined basis.
Now to full year and first quarter 2011 earnings guidance. Our guidance range for operating earnings for the full year of 2011 remains at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. More details regarding our 2011 guidance can be found in the guidance kit that will be available on our website later today. The principal negative driver to 2011 earnings compared to 2010 is lower realized margin from our merchant fleet due to lower commodity prices and higher planned outage expenses. Other negative factors include a return to normal weather in a regulated service territory and a higher effective tax rate due to the decrease or elimination of the manufacturing deduction. Factors somewhat offsetting these negatives, include higher electric sales growth commenced with the recovering economy, higher revenues from our various rider projects and lower utility outage cost. 
We have been saying for sometime that 2011 represents the year in which our commodity sensitive earnings bottom out. We still expect to achieve the previously forecasted 5% to 6% growth in earnings per share beginning in 2012. Dominion expects first quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.96 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011, compared to the prior year, include higher rider revenues and lower storm restoration expenses. Factors offsetting these positives include a return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher interest expenses. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.29 per share. For a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP, please refer to our GAAP reconciliation schedules contained in our earnings release kit.
As to hedging, we've added to our hedge positions at Millstone, increasing coverage of expected output to 70% for 2012. At our New England coal units, our hedge position was unchanged from the prior quarter. We also increased our hedge position at State Line to 77% for 2011 and 76% for 2012. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now approximately $0.02 per share.
Our sensitivity for 2012 is now only $0.05 per share. In addition, we have nearly reached our maximum hedge position for frac spreads each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 32 of our earnings release kit. Our hedge positions, coupled with current forward prices in a regulated growth plan support our 5% to 6% earnings growth rate beginning in 2012.
So let me summarize my financial review. First, we have achieved all of our important operational, strategic and financial goals in 2010. Second, our 2011 operating earnings range, guidance range remains unchanged at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. Third, we expect that the cash impact of bonus depreciation will eliminate our need for multi-issuance of common stock for the next two years. Fourth, we intend to mitigate the EPS impact of bonus depreciation through share repurchases and reduced debt issuances. And finally, we have secure hedges on our merchant fleet, which support our earnings guidance and growth targets.

When we get the final clarification on this, we’re going to go ahead and buy business segment showed by the exact impact. But as a general ruling and the reason for the wide range for us is that, as you know, we have several very large projects, and the biggest of which is the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, which is next year, that’s $1.8 billion. Bear Garden, our gas facility, closes this year over $600 million. Brayton Point cooling towers will commend this year and next. So depending if they get 50% or 100% bonus depreciation, that's the reason for the wide range. I would say that the main drivers in terms of the businesses that I would see a rate base growth are really based on the riders in Virginia for Beechach and for Bear Garden, as well as for the two large transmission projects. We are very comfortable with the bottom of the range at the 1.6 level. I think the question will be based on the final rules, which should be available in the next several months. Will that number approach to the top of the range part, or will stay at the 1.6 billion?"

267105,118141370,104132,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2011",2011-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone f",1374,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While we typically do not discuss issues related to M&A, I want to make a couple of comments, given market rumors regarding Dominion's interest in merging with or acquiring other utilities. As anyone familiar with our company knows, Dominion has a very strong organic growth plan. We are investing over $2 billion a year in growth projects across all of our regulated lines of business. Achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets does not depend on our ability to make acquisitions. If we were to consider an M&A transaction, it would have to be a unique opportunity that would not weaken our financial condition and would be accretive to earnings per share and shareholder value. 
Now turning to 2010.2010 was an extraordinary year for Dominion. We made significant progress on our strategic plan and demonstrated how our infrastructure growth plan will continue for at least the next five years. Our board of directors adopted a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratios to be more in line with our more regulated peers. Last month, the board authorized a 7.7% increase in the dividend to an annual rate of $1.97 per share. Also, our total shareholder return for the year was strong. 
We began the year with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia Power that maintains current base rates through at least 2013, and enables the company to earn competitive rates of return that support our infrastructure growth program. This was the first base rate case for the company under Virginia's new regulatory structure. We have since joined other parties in submitting a proposal to the Commission, which calls for the terms of the settlement to be extended for an additional year through a deferral of the first biennial review until 2012. This so-called staggering of the biennial review process was provided for in the 2007 ""re-regulation"" law. If approved by the Commission, the first biennial review will cover results for 2010 and 2011. And no change in base rates could occur before December 2014. 
The return on equity will continue to be 11.9% with a 50 basis point collar in the return on equity for the rate riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden generating plants will continue to be 12.3% for at least an additional year. 
While we are on the subject of regulation, during 2010, we also secured our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. The settlement agreement in that proceeding will increase annual non-fuel base revenues by $7.7 million and allow for a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses to be recovered through the fuel clause rather than base rates. 
We also advanced our strategic plan in March when we sold our Appalachian E&P business to CONSOL for $3.475 billion. This transaction enabled us to capture the value of our acreage in the Marcellus formation and significantly reduced our commodity price exposure. We used the proceeds from the sale to offset our equity needs, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and buy back common stock. 
One of the reasons for the sale was to focus our investment capital for developing the new infrastructure that will be necessary for the Marcellus region to develop. Since closing on the sale, we have announced four new Marcellus-related growth projects. New projects, such as the Marcellus 404 and the Northeast Expansion continue to move forward and are expected to contribute to earnings growth over the next five years. You can expect announcements of additional projects as the build out of the Marcellus region continues. 
Growth in our natural gas businesses is not just about the Marcellus development. Our Appalachian Gateway and Gathering Expansion projects represent about $900 million of new infrastructure that will come into service over the next two years. We're also pursuing an acceleration of the bare steel pipe replacement program at Dominion East Ohio. 
Finally, during the fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with our customer in the Cove Point expansion to shorten our contracts from 18 years to 10, which positions us to explore options to develop liquefaction capabilities at the site. A potential interest in such a facility would be limited to the infrastructure and not the commodity. The construction of the new electric generating capacity in Virginia is a key component of our strategic plan. Virginia continues to be the second-largest importer of power in the country. The latest load forecast from PJM supports the need for at least 4,500 megawatts of new capacity over just the next 10 years. 
Also during the year, we made significant progress on the construction of two new power stations, Bear Garden and the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Bear Garden is expected to be in service during the second quarter of this year, and Virginia City is expected to be in service during the summer of 2012. 
The next phase of our generation expansion plan also came into focus during 2010. We are proceeding with development of the power station in Warren County, Virginia, with about 1,300 megawatts of generating capacity. This natural gas power plant will utilize the three-on-one combined cycle technology and will be one of the most efficient gas powered units in the country. We received the final air permit for the project in December. And we'll file for a CPCN and rate rider for Warren County with the State Corporation Commission early next quarter. 
As part of the air permit process, we reached an agreement with the National Park Service to close our North Branch Power Station, the small 74-megawatt coal plant located in West Virginia. Our two major electric transmission projects, the Meadow Brook to Loudoun and Carson to Suffolk lines are also nearing completion. At our May 7 analyst meeting, we outlined our next major transmission project, the Mount Storm to Doubs line. That project received approval from PJM in December. The West Virginia Commission has already ruled that no filings are required to reconductor the line. We will begin road and tower foundation work in West Virginia this Spring. 
Last week, we filed for approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission to reconductor the Virginia portion of the line. Mount Storm to Doubs is the next step in what will be a multiyear depth upgrade of the 500kV transmission loop that forms the backbone of our region's electric transmission system. We also continue to optimize the value of our merchant generating portfolio. During 2010, we installed a new economizer at Brayton Point Unit 3, which will improve the reliability and efficiency of that unit. 
We also reached an agreement to sell the development rights of Phase IV of the Fowler Ridge Wind facility to VP, and are in the process of divesting our interest in the Morgantown Energy Center.2010 was an exceptional year for our operating performance as well. We experienced a record snowfall early in the year and one of the hottest summers on record. Despite these challenges, we continue to improve our safety performance and service reliability, even with the midyear voluntary separation program, which reduced our workforce by 7%. 
All three operating business units recorded their best safety performance in their history, an achievement for which we are proud but not satisfied.2010 marks the seventh year in a row where generation's nuclear fleet capacity factor exceeded 90%. Our nuclear upgrade projects added more than 85 megawatts to our summer capability. Fossil & Hydro's combined fleet achieved a new record Equivalent Forced Outage rate of 3.9% during 2010. Virginia Power fossil fleet did achieve a new record at 2.9%. Our electric transmission and distribution group improved this three-year rolling average reliability measure by 3% in 2010, compared to '09 and a 12% improvement over 2006. 
We've made significant improvements in our responsiveness to customer inquiries as well. Dominion East Ohio replaced over 250,000 meters under the AMR rider program last year. It also invested over $108 million to replace bare steel pipeline under the PIR rider program. In conclusion, I believe that from both a strategic and operational point of view, 2010 was an outstanding year for Dominion. I will now turn the call over to Mark, for a review of our financial results."

Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009",1497,"Thank you, Tom. Let me begin with consolidated 2010 results. Earnings in 2010 were very strong. Operating earnings were $3.34 per share, in the upper half of our original guidance range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share, and 2% above operating earnings for 2009. Favorable weather and higher rate adjustment clause revenues were the principal positive factors influencing the earnings. Our interest expense were also lower than expected as strong cash flow reduced our need for external debt financing. 
Partially offsetting these factors were lower margins from our merchant generation fleet and the absence of earnings from our previously owned Appalachian E&P business. We produced operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.63 per share, level with last year's fourth quarter and near the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings were $0.43 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.68 per share for the year. 
The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the year were the gain on the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations, the cost of the workforce reduction program, a charge related to the discontinued operations at Peoples Gas and impairment charges on certain merchant generation assets. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of our earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for 2010 was $891 million, near the midpoint of our original guidance range of $866 million to $930 million. The benefits of favorable weather in a regulated electric service territory were largely offset by major storm and service restoration costs and other investments to improve reliability. 
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $862 million compared to our original guidance range of $852 million to $894 million. Lower fuel costs for Dominion gas transmission were partially offset by a lower contribution from Producer Services. Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $2.3 billion for 2010, above the high end of our original guidance range. 
Favorable weather in our regulated electric service area more than offset costs from investments made to improve reliability. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results. We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. 
These supplemental schedules show quarterly and annual EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly and annual EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail. Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. 
The company generated very strong cash flow last year because of both good results from operations and from divestiture activities, enabling us to fund our CapEx program, invest in our pension plan, reduce debt and repurchase common stock. Liquidity at the end of the year was $2 billion. Our liquidity needs declined significantly when we sold our E&P business. 
You may recall that in September, we replaced and resized our credit commitments down to $3.5 billion. We are very comfortable with this new capacity level given our current and potential liquidity requirements. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit. 
We can't talk about our financing plans for the next few years without first discussing the impact of the bonus depreciation provision and the recent tax bills enacted by Congress. Many of the capital projects we have underway qualify for bonus depreciation, although there is still ambiguity as to whether some projects qualify for 50% or 100% depreciation. Our best estimate at this time is that the cash benefit will be between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion through 2013. We have already used a portion of the cash benefit to make a contribution to the Dominion pension plan, and we'll use future benefits to buy back common stock and afford debt that otherwise would've been issued over the next three years. 
As you know, there's a negative side to bonus depreciation. The deferred taxes that are created as a result of this accelerated depreciation will reduce our rate base, and it will reduce or eliminate the 199 or manufacturing tax deduction. The share repurchases and earnings benefit of the pension contribution should offset all the negative impacts for 2011 and most of the expected impact for 2012 and beyond. Now moving to our financing plan for this year. Recall that our previous plan, which was developed prior to the extension of bonus depreciation did not include any equity in 2011. 
With the benefits of bonus depreciation, we now plan to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity this year. On the debt side, we plan to issue between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of debt this year, including the funding of about $500 million in maturities. While the financing plan for 2012 is far from complete at this early date, we have determined that we do not need to have a market issue of common stock in 2012, and we'll determine at a later date whether to issue new shares or use market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and other plan requirements. 
We have already used $400 million of bonus depreciation tax savings to make a contribution to our pension plans. Dominion's pension plans have been very well-funded for quite some time, and its funding levels rank among the strongest, not only in the industry, but the entire Fortune 500. With this latest contribution, Dominion pension plans had a funded ratio of 116% on a combined basis. 
Now to full year and first quarter 2011 earnings guidance. Our guidance range for operating earnings for the full year of 2011 remains at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. More details regarding our 2011 guidance can be found in the guidance kit that will be available on our website later today. The principal negative driver to 2011 earnings compared to 2010 is lower realized margin from our merchant fleet due to lower commodity prices and higher planned outage expenses. Other negative factors include a return to normal weather in our regulated service territory and a higher effective tax rate due to the decrease or elimination of the manufacturing deduction. 
Factors somewhat offsetting these negatives include higher electric sales growth commensurate with a recovering economy, higher revenues from our various rider projects and lower utility outage cost. We have been saying for some time that 2011 represents the year in which our commodity sensitive earnings bottom out. We still expect to achieve the previously forecasted 5% to 6% growth in earnings per share beginning in 2012. 
Dominion expects first quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.96 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011, compared to the prior year, include higher rider revenues and lower storm restoration expenses. Factors offsetting these positives include a return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher interest expenses. 
GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.29 per share. For a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP, please refer to our GAAP reconciliation schedules contained in our earnings release kit. 
As to hedging, we've added to our hedge positions at Millstone, increasing coverage of expected output to 70% for 2012. At our New England coal units, our hedge position was unchanged from the prior quarter. We also increased our hedge position at State Line to 77% for 2011 and 76% for 2012. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now approximately $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is now only $0.05 per share. 
In addition, we have nearly reached our maximum hedge position for frac spreads each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 32 of our earnings release kit. Our hedge positions, coupled with current forward prices in a regulated growth plan support our 5% to 6% earnings growth rate beginning in 2012. 
So let me summarize my financial review. First, we have achieved all of our important operational, strategic and financial goals in 2010. Second, our 2011 operating earnings range, guidance range remains unchanged at $3.00 to $3.30 per share. Third, we expect that the cash impact of bonus depreciation will eliminate our need for multi-issuance of common stock for the next two years. Fourth, we intend to mitigate the EPS impact of bonus depreciation through share repurchases and reduced debt issuances. And finally, we have secure hedges on our merchant fleet, which support our earnings guidance and growth targets. We believe that our regulated growth plan, coupled with an expected total dividend increase of nearly 15% over the next two years, position us to provide strong returns for our shareholders. 
Thank you. And we’re now ready for your questions."

Bear Garden, our gas facility, closes this year over $600 million. Brayton Point cooling towers will commend this year and next. So depending if they get 50% or 100% bonus depreciation, that's the reason for the wide range. I would say that the main drivers in terms of the businesses that I would see a rate base growth are really based on the riders in Virginia for Beechach and for Bear Garden, as well as for the two large transmission projects. We are very comfortable with the bottom of the range at the 1.6 level. I think the question will be based on the final rules, which should be available in the next several months.

I know Jonathan, you follow the coal markets closely. We honestly had a at least a temporary run up based on summer challenges in Australia and in the South America on international coal, which is also driven up Central Ap prices higher than what we believe are sustainable. So we're going to be cautious on hedging our New England coal plant until we see some collection on coal. It's no surprise that these Dutch spreads are very small. And those units right now based on elevated coal prices and depressed power prices, so we're going to be very careful going in. We did hedge a significant amount at Millstone, over the last quarter were really liked the prices there on the power, that ran up. There was some pressure based on basis that helped the power spreads. But on coal, we want to be cautious, and we still believe that coal prices as we move to this year and Central Ap will be a normalized down to a lower level."

The pipe is there, the terminals are there, the logistics span appear.

Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.",1346,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.
GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share for the first quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was a write-off of the remaining book value of our Stateline power station and the impact of our decision to remove the financial results of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station from operating earnings based on our plans to sell the unit. This is the same treatment we used when selling peoples gas last year.
Tom Farrel will discuss the strategic rationale for selling Kewaunee in a few minutes.
Regarding Stateline, remember that last year, we wrote down the value of this asset after the one-hour SO2 rules were finalized by the EPA. Shortening its expected life to the end of 2017, because we would not be installing control equipment at the site.
In light of the recently proposed air toxics rules by the EPA, we have elected collected to not to bid the capacity of Stateline into the upcoming PJM capacity auction for the 2014 to 2015 planning period. This decision triggered an impairment test for Stateline and as a result, we have written off the remaining book value of the plant.
Under current market conditions, we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $290 million, exceeding the top of our guidance range. while the regulated business results were in line with guidance, Dominion Retail produced better-than-expected results due to higher gross margins and an increase in customers.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $291 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Results from gas transmission, gas distribution and producer services were all in line with our expectations.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $535 million for the first quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. As expected, earnings from our merchant generation business were down from last year but came in at the top of our guidance range due to stronger-than-expected market prices.
EBIT for the regulated generation fleet came in above our guidance range, primarily due to higher-than-expected PJM ancillary revenues. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, on our last call we outlined our financing plans for this year, including debt issuances of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion. We completed a significant portion of that need last month but a two-part offering at Dominion totaling $900 million. We issued $500 million of 10-year bonds and an effective interest rate of 4.48%, equivalent to 105 basis points spread to treasuries. And $400 million of 3-year notes that were swapped to a floating rate equivalent of 4 basis points above LIBOR.
We are recently updated our financing plans for 2011, and plan to issue an additional $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of debt during the remainder of this year. To take advantage of the current interest rate environment, we have paid $500 million of debt need.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any new common stock in 2011 as do not plan any public offerings in 2012. Depending on our cash needs and credit metrics, we may elect to issue new shares under our dividend reinvestment program and other internal plans in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.67 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the Earnings Release Kit.
On our last call, we estimated bonus depreciation would provide between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion of cash benefit from 2010 to 2013 and that we would be able to narrow that range upon clarification of certain rules by the IRS. We have been given some additional guidance and we now believe that proceeds from bonus depreciation will be close to $2 billion.
To offset the impact of bonus appreciation on our earnings, we announced a plan to repurchase between $400 million and $700 million in common stock during the year. We have update our estimates and can now narrow that range to $600 million to $700 million. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 6 million shares at a cost of $274 million.
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We are continuing to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012.
For the second quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.72 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Several factors account for the expected difference. We experienced very favorable weather in the second quarter of 2010 that added $0.06 per share to earnings. Also in last year's second quarter, we monetized several pre-issuance hedges that have been executed in anticipation of planned debt financing that became unnecessary due to a strong cash position. The resulting reduction in interest expense added $0.03 per share to last year's second quarter results.
The E&P business contributed $0.01 per share in the second quarter of last year and Kewaunee also added $0.01 per share. Other negative factors affecting second quarter 2011 earnings compared to the last year include a higher effective income tax rate and lower margin margins from our merchant generation portfolio. Factors offsetting these negatives include a lower share count and higher rider-related revenues.
GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2010 can be found on Page 40 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 33 of our Earnings Release Kit. Included in the update is the first disclosure of our hedges for 2013. 
With our power sales contract for Kincaid ending in January 2013, we have begun hedging the output for that plant. We have added hedges for millstone in 2013 but it left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our Inland coal unit remains unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low-dark spreads currently available in that market.
Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now less than $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share. You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as our average hedge price for 2013 is now over 2% above 2012. Also as Slide 11 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015 are currently up 9% and 15%, respectively, over 2012. This validates our view that the earnings from our merchant generation will be in 2011 and 2012.
so let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the first quarter of this year were very strong and near the top of our guidance range. Operating results of each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have completed nearly half of our debt financing needs for the year and have locked in attractive interest rates for a large portion of our remaining needs. 
Going to depreciation we'll provide about $2 billion of cash benefit through 2013 and we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million of common stock during 2011, 274 million of which has been completed.
Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Second quarter operatings guidance is $0.50 to $0.60 per share. And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support for earnings growth targets going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,118817519,119964,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% t",2058,"Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% to 6% beginning next year and driving a minimum of 65% to 75% of those earnings from our regulated businesses. As we have said in the past, we do not plan to invest new growth capital into our merchant generation business and would look over time to optimize the value over that portfolio.
Principal sources of income from our merchant generation fleet are our New England baseload plants. It is in that context that I want to discuss our decision to pursue the sale of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station. Dominion purchased Kewaunee in July 2005. Over the nearly 6 years of our ownership, we have returned the operations and safety performance at Kewaunee to among the best in the industry. Kewaunee was the first Nuclear plant in the Midwest to be sold by its original owners and the beginning of a series of transactions by other single Nuclear plant operators in that region. when we purchased Kewaunee, it was part of a strategic land to acquire 1 or more of these other units and build a business around that portfolio. While we were correct in believing that other plants will become available, were unsuccessful in winning the respective auctions options for that plants. 
Without the other units, the strategic rationale for continuing to own Kewaunee is diminished and we believe it is time to pursue a sale of the plant. Unlike the rest of our Midwest Generation fleet Kewaunee is part of the interconnection not the PJM. We believe the baseload generation, especially Nuclear in Wisconsin has long-term value and are confident we will find a buyer for the unit. 
Kewaunee has been operator under cost of service contract that is set to expire on December 2013, which was the expiration date of the original operating license. A 20-year license extension was granted by the NRC in February and we have been in discussions about a new power sales contract but nothing has been finalized. 
Mark also mentioned our decision not to bid the capacity of our state line power station into the upcoming PJM capacity auction and we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. This reflects our decision not to invest in new environmental control equipment at the plant.
Moving to the tax situation in Connecticut. As many of you are aware, the tax proposal passed by the Energy and Technology Committee of the Connecticut general assembly would have imposed a significant financial burden on our millstone power station. Last week the joint finance committee of the legislature, with the support of Governor Malloy, adopted a more reasonable tax proposal as part of their efforts to close their budget deficit. Under this proposal, the State would impose a $2.50 per megawatt hour tax on all traditional power generators located in Connecticut beginning July 1 of this year. the tax will automatically sunset on June 30, 2013. Proposed tax would cause Dominion about $24 million on an after-tax annualized basis. Under this proposal, there would be no change in our earnings guidance range for 2011 or our projected earnings growth rate.
our regulated side of our business, we made significant progress on our growth plan during the first quarter. The Bear Garden Power Station is virtually complete and undergoing final testing. It should become commercial next month. Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 84% complete at the end of the first quarter and is on plan to being commercial operation next summer. We are also in the process of securing an EPT contract for our next major generating project of 13,000-megawatt combined cycle plant in Warren County Virginia. We expect to file a CPCN and rate rider with the State Corporation Commission on May 2 and if approved, begin construction next spring.
We have discussed the impact of EPA's proposals on our merchant generating fleet. We have previously estimated the cost to with these new regulations at about $2 billion over the next 5 years for our regulated fleet and we see no basis to change that estimate at this time. We are evaluating the various compliance options, including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fire facilities, adding additional transmission capacity or some combination of all 3. We plan to discuss our full compliance strategy in September when we file our integrated resource plan with our regulators.
As part of our plan, we have announced a proposal to convert 3 coal units in Virginia to 50-megawatt plants that burn waste wood. These seldom-used power stations will operate at a higher capacity factor, with this lower-cost fuel. each conversion is expected to cost between $40 million and $50 million and are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.  We will file for SCC approval of these projects in late June. There's a lot of activity around our generator facilities and we believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges.
As to our Electric Transmission business, I'm pleased to announced that the 500 kV Meadow Brook to Loudoun transmission line was energized earlier this month, within budget and ahead of schedule. The Carson to Suffolk line is nearly complete and is expected to be energized in June. Work has began on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the rebuild Monsanto line. The hearing before the State Corporation commission on the Virginia portion of the line is scheduled for June 20. Our Electric Transmission Project pipeline contains over 40 projects, totaling about $500 million per year or for least each of the next 5 years. The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan.
The growth program at our Natural Gas business continues to move forward as well. The Cove Point Pier Expansion project was placed into service in January, within budget and ahead of schedule. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project received its environmental assessment from FERC on March 31 and we anticipate FERC approval for the project this quarter. Construction should begin this summer and if project should be in service by September 2012.
We've recently made progress on 3 new Marcellus-related projects, which will help us meet Dominion Energy's five-year growth goals. First, we concluded an open season on a new Marcellus-related project, which we call the Tioga Area Expansion Project. We assigned 2 agreements to provide 270,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation service to move new Marcellus shale volumes. Projected in-service date is November 2013. 
Second, recent agreements for a new Marcellus-related storage project were finalized in February. The Allegheny Storage Project provides for 7.5 Bcf of storage and 125,000 decatherms per day of year-round firm transportation service to 3 LDCs beginning in 2014. 
Finally, Dominion East Ohio energy entered into a letter of intent in March related to activities in the Utah shale formation. Under the proposal, Dominion will build several gathering systems between shale wells and our existing pipeline system. Dominion will be working on definitive agreements to further define gathering and transportation business terms.
Also at East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25-year $2.7 billion bear steel replacement program. The company has proposed nearly double its spending to more than $200 million per year.
I will now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. We continue to work toward our goal of 0 injuries to our employees. During the first quarter, our and Nuclear business unit operated without a single recordable incident. We do not believe that, that has ever happened in our company's 100-year history. In fact through the first quarter, our Nuclear business unit has operated over 15.2 million man-hours without a Lost Time Accident. Gas transmission finished the first quarter with its best overall safety performance since 2006. 
At our Electric Distribution and Transmission business, OSHA recordable and lost time and restricted duty incidents remained near historic lows. Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the first quarter. Availability at our Fossil & Hydro fleet has been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieve its best on-record rate. In addition, the Nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 99.3%, excluding refueling outages. 
2 weeks ago, tornado touched down near the transmissions switch yard at our Nuclear power station, taking out much of the infrastructure connecting Surry to the grid. both units were Operating at the time and was shut down safely. Emergency diesel generators provide a power to the plant until off-site power could be restored. Strong caused significant damage to the local area and we have restored service to all affected customers. Sori Unit 1 was returned to service this past weekend and Surry unit 2 has began its scheduled refueling.
Economic growth continue to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in the 13 state PJM region. Unemployment in Virginia is down to 6.3% well below the national average and is below 5% in northern Virginia. 2 very large public works projects in Northern Virginia, the metro silver line and the dolls airport expansion continue on schedule and will drive significant economic and load growth activity. 
Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration raised the height limitation for buildings in Virginia Beach, which we believe over the long term will lead to a significant revitalization of the region and new load growth. Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year is expected to grow to 370 megawatts by the end of the year and 532 megawatts by the end of next year. 
Finally, let me discuss our biennial review at our upcoming fuel filling. As many of you know, the first biennial review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31 and the SCC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and 2010 were within the 100-basis point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from is due in July and from the staff in August with hearing schedule to begin on September 20. 
Virginia law allows the SCC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings. Although the governing criteria such as the use of a peer group average of earned return and the inclusion of premiums property performance and meeting renewable energy targets still apply. Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
Next week, we will be filing our Annual Fuel Factor update for Virginia Power. Due to the very hot weather last summer, and other factors, our existing to a rate is on the record our fuel cost for the current period. In order to mitigate the impact on our customers, we will be proposing spread the recovery of the deferred fuel balance over a 2-year period, reducing the increase of customer rates. We have a commitment to our customers to provide reliable service, to meet growing demand and keep our rates very competitive. We believe it's spreading the fuel cost over longer periods is in the best interest of our customers. Even with this proposed increase, Virginia Power's rates will remain among the lowest in the Southeast and more than 10% below the national average. The details of our filing will be available when it is submitted to the commission next week.
So to conclude, Dominion is off to a very good start in 2011. First quarter earnings were in the upper half of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already in the top tier in our industry, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations. We continue to move forward with our infrastructure growth plans, completing several major projects and beginning several more.

Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.",1351,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.
GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share for the first quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was a write-off of the remaining book value of our State Line Power Station and the impact of our decision to remove the financial results of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station from operating earnings based on our plans to sell the unit. This is the same treatment we used when selling Peoples Gas last year. Tom Farrel will discuss the strategic rationale for selling Kewaunee in a few minutes.
Regarding State Line, remember that last year, we wrote down the value of this asset after the 1-hour SO2 rules were finalized by the EPA, shortening its expected life to the end of 2017, because we would not be installing control equipment at the site.
In light of the recently proposed Air Toxics Rule by the EPA, we have elected not to bid the capacity of State Line into the upcoming PJM Capacity Auction for the 2014 to 2015 planning period. This decision triggered an impairment test for State Line and as a result, we have written off the remaining book value of the plant. Under current market conditions, we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $290 million, exceeding the top of our guidance range. While the regulated business results were in line with guidance, Dominion Retail produced better-than-expected results due to higher gross margins and an increase in customers.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $291 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Results from gas transmission, gas distribution and producer services were all in line with our expectations.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $535 million for the first quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. As expected, earnings from our Merchant Generation business were down from last year, but came in at the top of our guidance range due to stronger-than-expected market prices.
EBIT for the regulated generation fleet came in above our guidance range, primarily due to higher-than-expected PJM ancillary revenues. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On our last call, we outlined our financing plans for this year, including debt issuances of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion. We completed a significant portion of that need last month, with a 2-part offering at Dominion totaling $900 million. We issued $500 million of 10-year bonds at an effective interest rate of 4.48%, equivalent to 105-basis-point spread to treasuries, and $400 million of 3-year notes that were swapped to a floating rate equivalent of 4 basis points above LIBOR. We have recently updated our financing plans for 2011, and plan to issue an additional $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of debt during the remainder of this year. To take advantage of the current interest-rate environment, we have hedged $500 million of that debt need.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any new net common stock in 2011 and do not plan any public offerings in 2012. Depending on our cash needs and credit metrics, we may elect to issue new shares under our dividend reinvestment program and other internal plans in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.67 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit.
On our last call, we estimated that bonus depreciation would provide between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion of cash benefit from 2010 to 2013 and that we would be able to narrow that range upon clarification of certain rules by the IRS. We have been given some additional guidance and we now believe that proceeds from bonus depreciation will be close to $2 billion. To offset the impact of bonus depreciation on our earnings, we announced the plan to repurchase between $400 million and $700 million in common stock during the year. We have updated our estimates and can now narrow that range to $600 million to $700 million. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 6 million shares at a cost of $274 million.
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We are continuing to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. For the second quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.72 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Several factors account for the expected difference. We experienced very favorable weather in the second quarter of 2010 that added $0.06 per share to earnings. Also in last year's second quarter, we monetized several pre-issuance hedges that have been executed in anticipation of planned debt financing that became unnecessary due to a strong cash position. The resulting reduction in interest expense added $0.03 per share to last year's second quarter results.
The E&P business contributed $0.01 per share in the second quarter of last year and Kewaunee also added $0.01 per share. Other negative factors affecting second quarter 2011 earnings compared to the last year include a higher effective income tax rate and lower margins from our merchant generation portfolio. Factors offsetting these negatives include a lower share count and higher rider-related revenues. GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2010 can be found on Page 40 of the earnings release kit. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 33 of our earnings release kit. Included in the update is the first disclosure of our hedges for 2013. 
With our power sales contract for Kincaid ending in February 2013, we have begun hedging the output for that plant. We have added hedges for Millstone in 2013, but have left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our New England Coal unit remain unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low dark spreads currently available in that market. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now less than $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share. You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as our average hedge price for 2013 is now over 2% above 2012. Also as Slide 11 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015 are currently up 9% and 15%, respectively, over 2012. This validates our view that the talk in earnings from our Merchant Generation business will be in 2011 and 2012.
So let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the first quarter of this year were very strong and near the top of our guidance range. Operating results of each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have completed nearly half of our debt financing needs for the year and have locked in attractive interest rates for a large portion of our remaining needs. 
Bonus depreciation will provide about $2 billion of cash benefit through 2013, and we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million of common stock during 2011, $274 million of which has been completed.
Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Second quarter operating guidance is $0.50 to $0.60 per share. And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support our earnings growth targets going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,118817519,120207,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% t",2077,"Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% to 6% beginning next year and driving a minimum of 65% to 75% of those earnings from our regulated businesses. As we have said in the past, we do not plan to invest new growth capital into our Merchant Generation business and would look over time to optimize the value of that portfolio.
The principal sources of income from our merchant generation fleet are our New England baseload plants. It is in that context that I want to discuss our decision to pursue the sale of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station. Dominion purchased Kewaunee in July 2005. Over the nearly 6 years of our ownership, we have returned the operations and safety performance at Kewaunee to among the best in the industry. Kewaunee was the first nuclear plant in the Midwest to be sold by its original owners and the beginning of a series of transactions by other single nuclear plant operators in that region. When we purchased Kewaunee, it was part of a strategic plan to acquire 1 or more of these other units and build a business around that portfolio. While we were correct in believing that other plants would become available, we were unsuccessful in winning the respective auctions for those plants. 
Without the other units, the strategic rationale for continuing to own Kewaunee is diminished, and we believe it is time to pursue a sale of the plant. Unlike the rest of our Midwest Generation fleet, Kewaunee is part of the MISO Interconnection, not PJM. We believe that baseload generation, especially nuclear in Wisconsin has long-term value and are confident, we will find a buyer for the unit. 
Kewaunee has been operated under cost-of-service contract that is set to expire in December 2013, which was the expiration date of the original operating license. A 20-year license extension was granted by the NERC in February, and we have been in discussions about a new power sales contract, but nothing has been finalized. 
Mark also mentioned our decision not to bid the capacity of our State Line Power Station into the upcoming PJM Capacity Auction and we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. This reflects our decision not to invest in new environmental control equipment at the plant.
Moving to the tax situation in Connecticut. As many of you are aware, the tax proposal passed by the Energy and Technology Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly would have imposed a significant financial burden on our Millstone Power Station. Last week, the joint finance committee of the legislature, with the support of Governor Malloy, adopted a more reasonable tax proposal as part of their efforts to close their budget deficit. Under this proposal, the state would impose a $2.50 per megawatt hour tax on all traditional power generators located in Connecticut beginning July 1 of this year. The tax will automatically sunset on June 30, 2013. The proposed tax would cost Dominion about $24 million on an after-tax annualized basis. Under this proposal, there would be no change in our earnings guidance range for 2011 or our projected earnings growth rate.
On the regulated side of our business, we made significant progress on our growth plan during the first quarter. The Bear Garden Power Station is virtually complete and undergoing final testing. It should become commercial next month. Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 84% complete at the end of the first quarter and is on plan to be in commercial operation next summer. We are also in the process of securing an EPC contract for our next major generating project of 13,000-megawatt combined cycle plant in Warren County, Virginia. We expect to file for a CPCN and rate rider with the State Corporation Commission on May 2, and if approved, begin construction next spring.
We have discussed the impact of EPA's proposed rules on our merchant generating fleet. We have previously estimated the cost to comply with these new regulations at about $2 billion over the next 5 years for our regulated fleet, and we see no basis to change that estimate at this time. We are evaluating the various compliance options, including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fired facilities, adding additional transmission capacity or some combination of all 3. We plan to discuss our full compliance strategy in September when we file our integrated resource plan with our regulators.
As part of our plan, we have announced a proposal to convert 3 coal units in Virginia to 50-megawatt plants that burn waste wood. These seldom-used power stations will operate at a higher capacity factor, with this lower-cost fuel. Each conversion is expected to cost between $40 million and $50 million and are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.  We will file for SCC approval of these projects in late June. There's a lot of activity around our generator facilities and we believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges.
As to our Electric Transmission business, I'm pleased to announce that the 500 kV Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun transmission line was energized earlier this month, within budget and ahead of schedule. The Carson-to-Suffolk line is nearly complete and is expected to be energized in June. Work has began on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line. A hearing before the State Corporation Commission on the Virginia portion of the line is scheduled for June 20. Our Electric Transmission Project pipeline contains over 40 projects, totaling about $500 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan.
The growth program at our Natural Gas business continues to move forward as well. The Cove Point Pier Expansion project was placed into service in January, within budget and ahead of schedule. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project received its environmental assessment from FERC on March 31, and we anticipate FERC approval for the project this quarter. Construction should begin this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012.
We have recently made progress on 3 new Marcellus-related projects, which will help us meet Dominion Energy's 5-year growth goals. First, we concluded an open season on a new Marcellus-related project, which we call the Tioga Area Expansion Project. We have signed 2 precedent agreements to provide 270,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation service to move new Marcellus shale volumes. Projected in-service date is November 2013. 
Second, precedent agreements for a new Marcellus-related storage project were finalized in February. The Allegheny Storage Project provides for 7.5 Bcf of storage and 125,000 decatherms per day of year-round firm transportation service to 3 LDCs, beginning in 2014. 
Finally, Dominion East Ohio and Chesapeake Energy entered into a Letter of Intent in March related to Chesapeake's activities in the Utica Shale formation. Under the proposal, Dominion will build several gathering systems between Chesapeake Shale wells and our existing pipeline system. Dominion and Chesapeake will be working on definitive agreements to further define gathering and transportation business terms.
Also at East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25-year, $2.7 billion bare steel pipe replacement program. The company has proposed to nearly double its spending to more than $200 million per year.
I will now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. We continue to work toward our goal of 0 injuries to our employees. During the first quarter, our Fossil & Hydro and Nuclear business units operated without a single OSHA recordable incident. We do not believe that, that has ever happened in our company's 100-year history. In fact, through the first quarter, our Nuclear business unit has operated over 15.2 million man-hours without a lost time accident. Gas transmission finished the first quarter with its best overall safety performance since 2006. At our Electric Distribution and Transmission business, OSHA recordable and lost time and restricted duty incidents remained near historic lows. 
********************************************************
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the first quarter. Availability at our Fossil & Hydro fleet has been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieved its best-on-record forced outage rate. In addition, the Nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 99.3%, excluding refueling outages. 
2 weeks ago, a tornado touched down near the transmission switch yard at our Surry Nuclear Power Station, taking out much of the infrastructure connecting Surry to the grid. Both units were operating at the time and were shut down safely. Emergency diesel generators provided power to the plant until off-site power could be restored. Storm caused significant damage to the local area, and we have restored service to all affected customers. Surry Unit 1 was returned to service this past weekend and Surry Unit 2 has begun its scheduled refueling.
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's serviced territory is the highest in the 13-state PJM region. Unemployment in Virginia is down to 6.3%, well below the national average, and is below 5% in Northern Virginia. 2 very large public works projects in Northern Virginia, the Metro Silver Line and the Dulles Airport expansion continue on schedule and will drive significant economic and load growth activity. 
Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration raised the height limitation for buildings in Virginia Beach, which we believe, over the long term, will lead to a significant revitalization of the region and new load growth. Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year is expected to grow to 370 megawatts by the end of the year and 532 megawatts by the end of next year. 
Finally, let me discuss our biennial review and our upcoming fuel filling. As many of you know, the first biennial review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31 and the SCC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and 2010 were within the 100-basis-point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from intervenors is due in July, and from the staff, in August, with hearing schedule to begin on September 20. 
Virginia law allows the SCC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings. Although, the governing criteria such as the use of a peer-group average of earned return and the inclusion of premiums for operating performance and meeting renewable energy targets still apply. Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
Next week, we will be filing our annual fuel factor update for Virginia Power. Due to the very hot weather last summer and other factors, our existing fuel rate has under-recovered our fuel cost over the current fuel period. In order to mitigate the impact on our customers, we will be proposing to spread the recovery of the deferred fuel balance over a 2-year period, reducing the increase to customer rates. We have a commitment to our customers to provide reliable service, meet growing demand and keep our rates very competitive. We believe that spreading the fuel cost over a longer period is in the best interest of our customers. Even with this proposed increase, Virginia Power's rates will remain among the lowest in the Southeast and more than 10% below the national average. The details of our filing will be available when it is submitted to the Commission next week.
So to conclude, Dominion is off to a very good start in 2011. First quarter earnings were in the upper half of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already in the top tier in our industry, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations. We continue to move forward with our infrastructure-growth plans, completing several major projects and beginning several more. 
Thank you. And we are now ready for your questions."

Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.",1351,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong first quarter. Operating earnings were $0.93 per share, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. All of our businesses performed very well.
GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share for the first quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was a write-off of the remaining book value of our State Line Power Station and the impact of our decision to remove the financial results of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station from operating earnings based on our plans to sell the unit. This is the same treatment we used when selling Peoples Gas last year. Tom Farrel will discuss the strategic rationale for selling Kewaunee in a few minutes.
Regarding State Line, remember that last year, we wrote down the value of this asset after the 1-hour SO2 rules were finalized by the EPA, shortening its expected life to the end of 2017, because we would not be installing control equipment at the site.
In light of the recently proposed Air Toxics Rule by the EPA, we have elected not to bid the capacity of State Line into the upcoming PJM Capacity Auction for the 2014 to 2015 planning period. This decision triggered an impairment test for State Line and as a result, we have written off the remaining book value of the plant. Under current market conditions, we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $290 million, exceeding the top of our guidance range. While the regulated business results were in line with guidance, Dominion Retail produced better-than-expected results due to higher gross margins and an increase in customers.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $291 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Results from gas transmission, gas distribution and producer services were all in line with our expectations.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $535 million for the first quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. As expected, earnings from our Merchant Generation business were down from last year, but came in at the top of our guidance range due to stronger-than-expected market prices.
EBIT for the regulated generation fleet came in above our guidance range, primarily due to higher-than-expected PJM ancillary revenues. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On our last call, we outlined our financing plans for this year, including debt issuances of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion. We completed a significant portion of that need last month, with a 2-part offering at Dominion totaling $900 million. We issued $500 million of 10-year bonds at an effective interest rate of 4.48%, equivalent to 105-basis-point spread to treasuries, and $400 million of 3-year notes that were swapped to a floating rate equivalent of 4 basis points above LIBOR. We have recently updated our financing plans for 2011, and plan to issue an additional $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of debt during the remainder of this year. To take advantage of the current interest-rate environment, we have hedged $500 million of that debt need.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any new net common stock in 2011 and do not plan any public offerings in 2012. Depending on our cash needs and credit metrics, we may elect to issue new shares under our dividend reinvestment program and other internal plans in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.67 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit.
On our last call, we estimated that bonus depreciation would provide between $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion of cash benefit from 2010 to 2013 and that we would be able to narrow that range upon clarification of certain rules by the IRS. We have been given some additional guidance and we now believe that proceeds from bonus depreciation will be close to $2 billion. To offset the impact of bonus depreciation on our earnings, we announced a plan to repurchase between $400 million and $700 million in common stock during the year. We have updated our estimates and can now narrow that range to $600 million to $700 million. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 6 million shares at a cost of $274 million.
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We are continuing to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. For the second quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.72 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Several factors account for the expected difference. We experienced very favorable weather in the second quarter of 2010 that added $0.06 per share to earnings. Also in last year's second quarter, we monetized several pre-issuance hedges that have been executed in anticipation of planned debt financing that became unnecessary due to a strong cash position. The resulting reduction in interest expense added $0.03 per share to last year's second quarter results.
The E&P business contributed $0.01 per share in the second quarter of last year and Kewaunee also added $0.01 per share. Other negative factors affecting second quarter 2011 earnings compared to the last year include a higher effective income tax rate and lower margins from our merchant generation portfolio. Factors offsetting these negatives include a lower share count and higher rider-related revenues. GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2010 can be found on Page 40 of the earnings release kit. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 33 of our earnings release kit. Included in the update is the first disclosure of our hedges for 2013. 
With our power sales contract with Kincaid ending in February 2013, we have begun hedging the output for that plant. We have added hedges for Millstone in 2013, but have left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our New England Coal units remain unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low dark spreads currently available in that market. Our consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now less than $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share. You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as our average hedge price for 2013 is now over 2% above 2012. Also as Slide 11 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015 are currently up 9% and 15%, respectively, over 2012. This validates our view that the trough in earnings from our Merchant Generation business will be in 2011 and 2012.
So let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the first quarter of this year were very strong and near the top of our guidance range. Operating results of each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have completed nearly half of our debt financing needs for the year and have locked in attractive interest rates for a large portion of our remaining needs. 
Bonus depreciation will provide about $2 billion of cash benefit through 2013, and we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million of common stock during 2011, $274 million of which has been completed.
Our operating earnings guidance for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Second quarter operating guidance is $0.50 to $0.60 per share. And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support our earnings growth targets going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,118817519,120220,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% t",2077,"Good morning. I have a number of topics to cover today. As you know, Dominion is making significant demand-driven investments in all of our regulated lines of business. These investments support our goal of growing our operating earnings per share by 5% to 6% beginning next year and driving a minimum of 65% to 75% of those earnings from our regulated businesses. As we have said in the past, we do not plan to invest new growth capital into our Merchant Generation business and would look over time to optimize the value of that portfolio.
The principal sources of income from our merchant generation fleet are our New England baseload plants. It is in that context that I want to discuss our decision to pursue the sale of our Kewaunee Nuclear power station. Dominion purchased Kewaunee in July 2005. Over the nearly 6 years of our ownership, we have returned the operations and safety performance at Kewaunee to among the best in the industry. Kewaunee was the first nuclear plant in the Midwest to be sold by its original owners and the beginning of a series of transactions by other single nuclear plant operators in that region. When we purchased Kewaunee, it was part of a strategic plan to acquire 1 or more of these other units and build a business around that portfolio. While we were correct in believing that other plants would become available, we were unsuccessful in winning the respective auctions for those plants. 
Without the other units, the strategic rationale for continuing to own Kewaunee was diminished, and we believe it is time to pursue a sale of the plant. Unlike the rest of our Midwest Generation fleet, Kewaunee is part of the MISO Interconnection, not PJM. We believe that baseload generation, especially nuclear in Wisconsin has long-term value and are confident, we will find a buyer for the unit. 
Kewaunee has been operated under a cost-of-service contract that is set to expire in December 2013, which was the expiration date of the original operating license. A 20-year license extension was granted by the NERC in February, and we have been in discussions about a new power sales contract, but nothing has been finalized. 
Mark also mentioned our decision not to bid the capacity of our State Line Power Station into the upcoming PJM Capacity Auction and we will be retiring the plant no later than the middle of 2014. This reflects our decision not to invest in new environmental control equipment at the plant.
Moving to the tax situation in Connecticut. As many of you are aware, the tax proposal passed by the Energy and Technology Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly would have imposed a significant financial burden on our Millstone Power Station. Last week, the joint finance committee of the legislature, with the support of Governor Malloy, adopted a more reasonable tax proposal as part of their efforts to close their budget deficit. Under this proposal, the state would impose a $2.50 per megawatt hour tax on all traditional power generators located in Connecticut beginning July 1 of this year. The tax will automatically sunset on June 30, 2013. The proposed tax would cost Dominion about $24 million on an after-tax annualized basis. Under this proposal, there would be no change in our earnings guidance range for 2011 or our projected earnings growth rate.
On the regulated side of our business, we made significant progress on our growth plan during the first quarter. The Bear Garden Power Station is virtually complete and undergoing final testing. It should become commercial next month. Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 84% complete at the end of the first quarter and is on plan to be in commercial operation next summer. We are also in the process of securing an EPC contract for our next major generating project of 1,300-megawatt combined cycle plant in Warren County, Virginia. We expect to file for a CPCN and rate rider with the State Corporation Commission on May 2, and if approved, begin construction next spring.
We have discussed the impact of EPA's proposed rules on our merchant generating fleet. We have previously estimated the cost to comply with these new regulations at about $2 billion over the next 5 years for our regulated fleet, and we see no basis to change that estimate at this time. We are evaluating the various compliance options, including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fired facilities, adding additional transmission capacity or some combination of all 3. We plan to discuss our full compliance strategy in September when we file our integrated resource plan with our regulators.
As part of our plan, we have announced a proposal to convert 3 coal units in Virginia to 50-megawatt plants that burn waste wood. These seldom-used power stations will operate at a higher capacity factor, with this lower-cost fuel. Each conversion is expected to cost between $40 million and $50 million and are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.  We will file for SCC approval of these projects in late June. There's a lot of activity around our generator facilities and we believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges.
As to our Electric Transmission business, I'm pleased to announce that the 500 kV Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun transmission line was energized earlier this month, within budget and ahead of schedule. The Carson-to-Suffolk line is nearly complete and is expected to be energized in June. Work has began on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line. A hearing before the State Corporation Commission on the Virginia portion of the line is scheduled for June 20. Our Electric Transmission Project pipeline contains over 40 projects, totaling about $500 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan.
The growth program at our Natural Gas business continues to move forward as well. The Cove Point Pier Expansion project was placed into service in January, within budget and ahead of schedule. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project received its environmental assessment from FERC on March 31, and we anticipate FERC approval for the project this quarter. Construction should begin this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012.
We have recently made progress on 3 new Marcellus-related projects, which will help us meet Dominion Energy's 5-year growth goals. First, we concluded an open season on a new Marcellus-related project, which we call the Tioga Area Expansion Project. We have signed 2 precedent agreements to provide 270,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation service to move new Marcellus shale volumes. Projected in-service date is November 2013. 
Second, precedent agreements for a new Marcellus-related storage project were finalized in February. The Allegheny Storage Project provides for 7.5 Bcf of storage and 125,000 decatherms per day of year-round firm transportation service to 3 LDCs, beginning in 2014. 
Finally, Dominion East Ohio and Chesapeake Energy entered into a Letter of Intent in March related to Chesapeake's activities in the Utica Shale formation. Under the proposal, Dominion will build several gathering systems between Chesapeake Shale wells and our existing pipeline system. Dominion and Chesapeake will be working on definitive agreements to further define gathering and transportation business terms.
Also in East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25-year, $2.7 billion bare steel pipe replacement program. The company has proposed to nearly double its spending to more than $200 million per year.
I will now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. We continue to work toward our goal of 0 injuries to our employees. During the first quarter, our Fossil & Hydro and Nuclear business units operated without a single OSHA recordable incident. We do not believe that, that has ever happened in our company's 100-year history. In fact, through the first quarter, our Nuclear business unit has operated over 15.2 million man-hours without a lost time accident. Gas transmission finished the first quarter with its best overall safety performance since 2006. At our Electric Distribution and Transmission business, OSHA recordable and lost time and restricted duty incidents remained near historic lows.
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the first quarter. Availability at our Fossil & Hydro fleet has been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieved its best-on-record forced outage rate. In addition, the Nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 99.3%, excluding refueling outages. 
2 weeks ago, a tornado touched down near the transmission switch yard at our Surry Nuclear Power Station, taking out much of the infrastructure connecting Surry to the grid. Both units were operating at the time and were shut down safely. Emergency diesel generators provided power to the plant until off-site power could be restored. Storm caused significant damage to the local area, and we have restored service to all affected customers. Surry Unit 1 was returned to service this past weekend and Surry Unit 2 has begun its scheduled refueling.
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's serviced territory is the highest in the 13-state PJM region. Unemployment in Virginia is down to 6.3%, well below the national average, and is below 5% in Northern Virginia. Two very large public works projects in Northern Virginia, the Metro Silver Line and the Dulles Airport expansion continue on schedule and will drive significant economic and load growth activity. 
Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration raised the height limitation for buildings in Virginia Beach, which we believe, over the long term, will lead to a significant revitalization of the region and new load growth. Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year is expected to grow to 370 megawatts by the end of the year and 532 megawatts by the end of next year. 
Finally, let me discuss our biennial review and our upcoming fuel filling. As many of you know, the first biennial review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31 and the SCC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and 2010 were within the 100-basis-point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from intervenors is due in July, and from the staff, in August, with hearing schedule to begin on September 20. 
Virginia law allows the SCC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings. Although, the governing criteria such as the use of a peer-group average of earned return and the inclusion of premiums for operating performance and meeting renewable energy targets still apply. Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
Next week, we will be filing our annual fuel factor update for Virginia Power. Due to the very hot weather last summer and other factors, our existing fuel rate has under-recovered our fuel cost over the current fuel period. In order to mitigate the impact on our customers, we will be proposing to spread the recovery of the deferred fuel balance over a 2-year period, reducing the increase to customer rates. We have a commitment to our customers to provide reliable service, meet growing demand and keep our rates very competitive. We believe that spreading the fuel cost over a longer period is in the best interest of our customers. Even with this proposed increase, Virginia Power's rates will remain among the lowest in the Southeast and more than 10% below the national average. The details of our filing will be available when it is submitted to the Commission next week.
So to conclude, Dominion is off to a very good start in 2011. First quarter earnings were in the upper half of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already in the top tier in our industry, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations. We continue to move forward with our infrastructure-growth plans, completing several major projects and beginning several more. 
Thank you. And we are now ready for your questions."

Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for",1051,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for the second quarter of last year by $0.06 per share, added only $0.01 compared to normal. Despite the normal weather, both of our Electric business segments delivered earnings at or above the top of the respective guidance ranges. Other factors impacting the results for the quarter relative to guidance were lower interest cost and higher income taxes.
GAAP earnings per were $0.58 per share for the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the benefit of a resolution of a lawsuit with the Department of Energy over spent nuclear fuel, offset by severance charges related to the previously announced closing of the Salem and State Line generation plants. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $227 million, near the high end of our guidance range. Higher transmission revenues and the higher contribution from Dominion retail were principal factors and the strong performance.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $184 million just above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong contribution from Producer Services offset lower results from our distribution companies.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $372 million for the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Higher ancillary service revenues and higher than expected Merchant generation margins for the principal, favorable earnings diverse. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On our last call, we outlined our financing plans for the remainder of the year, including debt issuances of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. To take advantage of the current interest rate environment, we have hedged treasury rates for $600 million of that debt need of 2011 and have taken a further step of locking in treasury rates related to over half of our 2012 needs.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also, other than the potential issuances of up to $300 million of stock through our stock repurchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
To offset the impact of bonus depreciation on our earnings, we announced a plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million of common stock during the year. To the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares at a cost of about $600 million. We will make a decision of whether or not to repurchase the additional $100 million later in the year.
Now to earnings guidance. Our earnings -- our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect annual earnings per share for share growth of 5% to 6% growth beginning in 2012. For the third quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share year, compared to operating earnings of $1.03 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Last year's above normal temperatures added $0.08 per share to third quarter earnings.
Other factors leading to lower third quarter earnings compared to last year include lower expected margins from our Merchant Generation business and a higher effective income tax rate. Offsetting these factors are higher expected base and rider related revenues and a lower share count. GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2010 can be found in Page 40 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We have added to our hedges for Millstone in 2013 but have left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our New England Coal units remain largely unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low dark spreads currently available in that market. However, we were able to hedge about 10% of our expected output for 2012 due to a rise in power prices for the early months.
The consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to $5 change in the New England Power prices is now about $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share.
You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as current market prices for 2013 are 3% higher than 2012. Also on Slide 8 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015, are up 6% and 12%, respectively over 2012. This validates our view that the earnings for our Merchant Generation business will be in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, we have begun to capture some of the uplift in 2014 and 2015 by layering in some hedges for Millstone in those years. Event to begin disclosing these longer dated hedge positions later this year.
So let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the second quarter this year were very strong and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have hedges in place for a large portion of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have completed $600 million in share repurchases through the first half of the year, and we decide whether or not to pursue up to $100 million in additional repurchases later this year. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1 per share.
And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support our earnings growth targets going forward. We have begun to capture some of that growth with some longer dated hedges. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrel."
267105,137334751,147907,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. Many of the projects announced at the outset of this program in 2007 are either currently in operation or nearing completion, and we are now well into the development o",2301,"Good morning. We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. Many of the projects announced at the outset of this program in 2007 are either currently in operation or nearing completion, and we are now well into the development on the next round of projects. These investments which we announced last September are spread across all of our regulated lines of business and provide the foundation for our growth in earnings and dividends.
We see the potential for this growth to continue beyond the current 5-year window through the end of the decade. Since we began this program in 2007, we have added over 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity to our Virginia fleet, with the construction new combined cycle facility, beacon facilities, as well as operates to some of our existing plants.
In May, the 580-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station and Buckingham County, began commercial operation and has run for over 60 days without any forced outage or automatic trips. Bear Garden is completed on time and on budget. We will add another 585 megawatts next summer when the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center the coal and wood burning plant in Wise county is scheduled to begin commercial operation. Virginia City is about 90% complete and is also proceeding on budget and on-time. There's about 2,200 workers on site during this past quarter.
Our next generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia that will provide approximately 1,300 megawatts and when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on May 2, and an EPC contract was executed on June 30. EPC contract is fixed price which significantly reduces the cost of overruns to the company and its customers. Site work has commenced and the final told us to proceed was issued with by the manufacturer of the major equipment.
Yet regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014. The estimated cost of the project is $1.1 billion, excluding financing cost, or only about $821 per kW, which combined with its 6,600 heat rate provides substantial economic value for our customers.
Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its a growing service territory. We will provide periodic updates as we refine our growth plans.
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed price, was executed on June 30, and we are in the process of contracting with fuel aggregators for each of the facilities. As the cost of the conversions is $165 million, and if projects are approved by regulators, should be completed in 2013.
On that environment front. As you are aware, The Environmental Protection Agency issued its cross state air pollution rule earlier this month. In a change from the earlier drafts, the state of Massachusetts were our Brayton Point Power Station is located was excluded from the program. The program also excludes Rhode Island where our Manchester Street Station is located.
We are evaluating our compliance options for our generating fleet in Virgin including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fired facilities, adding additional transmission capacity or some combination of all 3. We will discuss our full compliance strategy later this year when we file our integrated resource plan with regulators.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. I'm pleased to announce that both of our major 500 kb editions, the Meadow Brook to Loudon and the Carson to Suffolk lines are in-service. Both were completed on/or ahead of schedule and within budget.
Work has began on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the modernization of the Mt. Storm to Doubs line. A hearing before the State Corporation Commission on the Virginia portion of the line was held on June 20, and we expect an order later this year. Work on this project will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $500 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. You should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available in both the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. Before turning to some developments there, let me update you on our midstream expansion projects that arise from the constraint conventional fields in the Appalachian basing.
The life or life extraction plant, part of our Gathering Enhancement project was completed during the quarter. The Charleroi per paint truck loading terminal, which provides access to the Pittsburgh market, was placed in-service on June 3. Both projects were completed on time and within budget. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway project received approval from FERC last month. Construction will begin this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012.
Now to the shale opportunities. Last quarter, we announced 3 new projects, which support Dominion Energy's 5 year growth outlook. These were the Tioga area expansion, the Allegheny Storage Project and our letter of intent between Chesapeake Energy and Dominion East Ohio to develop gathering systems to support Chesapeake's activities in the Utica shale formation.
Our next major project in the Marcellus and Utica regions has been finalized. We have acquired a site on the Ohio River in Matrim, West Virginia to construct a large gas processing infractionation plant. With the rising price of oil and the depressed price of natural gas, drilling activity in the region has shifted from a dry gas to wet gas areas formation as producers look to capture the economic value of the natural gas liquids. As a result, the region has a significant need for additional processing and fractionation capacity. The Matrim site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe offering significant value to producers.
During the second quarter, we're executed binding, gathering, processing and fractionation agreements with 3 customers. On July 1, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process $200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. This pace of the project is currently over 90% contracted and is expected to be in-service by December 2012. Chesapeake Energy is the largest customer. Having a commitment to provide 100 million cubic feet a day.
The Phase 1 cost of Natrium, the processing, fractionation, plant inlet and outlet natural gas transportation, gathering in various modes of NGL transportation is approximately $500 million. We can expand the facility to accommodate additional demand for producers and are currently working to secure additional commitments for a second phase of the project. Chesapeake Energy has an existing option or a portion of Phase 2. If the contracts are finalized, we would expand the facility to 400 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and 59,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Expansion of the facility will need lead to a significant investment opportunities for our midstream business.
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, interest in our coal point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin.
At East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25 year, $2.7 billion barrels steel pipe replacement program to nearly double the spending to more than $200 million per year. We have reached settlement agreement with the Commission staff to increase spending by $40 million bringing the total to $160 million per year. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the Public Utilities Commission. The hearing was held on July 22, and we expect an order in the near future.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. Last quarter, I discussed the record safety performance from our Hydro in Nuclear business units. This quarter, I want to highlight the safety performance at our natural gas businesses. Gas transmissions, lost time, restricted duty incident rate for the first half of the year matches its best ever performance. Dominion Health recorded 0 reportable or loss time estimates for the quarter and Dominion East Ohio recorded the best safety performance in over a decade. Cove Point was recognized for its safety and security performance, as well as its community involvement, with awards from the United States Coast Guard and the Southern Maryland economic development Association. Our other business units continue to register improving metrics for safety performance.
Moving to operations. Our generating plants performed well in the second quarter. Availability for our Hydro fleet have been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieved its best ever forced outage rate. North Ann Power Station at Millstone Unit 3 have operated at 100% capacity during the first half of the year. A spring refueling outage at Millstone Unit 2 was accomplished in a unit record 30 days. The spring refueling outage at store Unit 2 included a high-pressure turbine replacement, which was the final portion of the capacity upgrade project, expected to add about 40 megawatts.
The tornado touched down on the site at the outset of the outage, which combined with the valve malfunction to lay the restart of the unit by about 25 days.
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is at 6%, well below the national average of over 9% and is only 4.5% in Northern Virginia. New connects have been running below expectations, but sales growth has been strong. Weather adjusted, sales were up 3% in the second quarter after rising 2.1% in the first quarter.
Last Friday, Virginia Power set a new all-time record peak demand of over 20,000 megawatts, an increase of nearly 2% over the previous peak set in August 2007.
Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Through the first half of the year, 5 new data centers have been connected adding about 12 megawatts of new load to our system. We expect that another 63 megawatts of new look from data centers by the end of this year. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year, should grow to 545 megawatts by the end of next year and 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year. I've already mentioned the recent filings related to our new growth projects that Warren County and the biomass conversions. Updates for the Riders for the Bear Garden and Virginia City were filed on June 27.
Last week, the State Corporate Commission issued an order on our annual commission rate Rider filing approving an annual revenue requirement of $466.4 million, which fully supports recovery of the cost related to our growth projects. The new rate becomes effective September 1.
On June 27, the State Corporation Commission approved our request to recover over $430 million deferred fuel cost over a 24-month period rather than the traditional 12-month recovery called for in the statute. Our request for the extended recovery period reflects our desire to mitigate the impact on our customers.
Finally, a few comments about our Biennial Review. As many of you know, the first Biennial Review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31, and the SEC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and '10 were within the 100 basis point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from intervenors were filed last week and waste no unexpected issues. Staff testimonies due in August and our scheduled for September 20. Virginia law allowed the SEC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings, although the governing criteria, such as the use of a peer group average of earned returns and the inclusion of premiums for operating performance, and where meeting renewable energy targets still apply.
Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
So to conclude, second quarter earnings were at the high end of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already at the top tier in our industry. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations.
We continue to move forward with our growth plants, completing several major projects and beginning several more. This fall, we plan to provide more details around the next stage of our growth plan, including our plans for Virginia Power to comply with new EPA regulations, the continued build out of the midstream infrastructure in the Marcellus in Utica shale regions, and disclosure of longer dated hedging activities designed for lock-in improving margins for our merchant generating fleet.
Thank you. And we are now ready for your questions."

Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for",1046,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for the second quarter of last year by $0.06 per share, added only $0.01 compared to normal. Despite the normal weather, both of our electric business segments delivered earnings at or above the top of the respective guidance ranges. Other factors impacting the results for the quarter relative to guidance were lower interest cost and higher income taxes.
GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share for the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the benefit of a resolution of a lawsuit with the Department of Energy over spent nuclear fuel, offset by severance charges related to the previously announced closing of the Salem and State Line merchant generation plants. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $227 million, near the high end of our guidance range. Higher transmission revenues and a higher contribution from Dominion Retail were principal factors in this strong performance.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $184 million, just above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong contribution from Producer Services offset lower results from our distribution companies.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $372 million for the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Higher ancillary service revenues and higher-than-expected merchant generation margins were the principal favorable earnings drivers. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On our last call, we outlined our financing plans for the remainder of the year, including debt issuances of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. To take advantage of the current interest rate environment, we have hedged treasury rates for $600 million of the debt need for 2011 and have taken a further step of locking in treasury rates related to over half of our 2012 needs.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also, other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
To offset the impact of bonus depreciation on our earnings, we announced a plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million in common stock during the year. To the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares at a cost of about $600 million. We will make a decision of whether or not to repurchase the additional $100 million later in the year.
Now to earnings guidance. Our earnings -- our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% growth beginning in 2012. For the third quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share, compared to operating earnings of $1.03 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Last year's above normal temperatures added $0.08 per share to third quarter earnings.
Other factors leading to lower third quarter earnings compared to last year include lower expected margins from our merchant generation business and a higher effective income tax rate. Offsetting these factors are higher expected base and rider-related revenues and a lower share count. GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2010 can be found on Page 40 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We have added to our hedges for Millstone in 2013, but have left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our New England Coal units remain largely unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low dark spreads currently available in that market. However, we were able to hedge about 10% of our expected output for 2012 due to a rise in power prices for the early months.
The consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now about $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share.
You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as current market prices for 2013 are 3% higher than 2012. Also as Slide 8 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015 are up 6% and 12%, respectively, over 2012. This validates our view that the drop in earnings for our merchant generation business will be in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, we have begun to capture some of the uplift in 2014 and 2015 by layering in some hedges for Millstone in those years. We plan to begin disclosing these longer-dated hedge positions later this year.
So let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the second quarter this year were very strong and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have hedges in place for a large portion of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have completed $600 million in share repurchases through the first half of the year, and we'll decide whether or not to pursue up to $100 million in additional repurchases later this year. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1 per share.
And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support our earnings growth targets going forward. We have begun to capture some of that growth with some longer-dated hedges. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrel."
267105,137334751,148256,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. Many of the projects announced at the outset of this program in 2007 are either currently in operation or nearing completion, and we are now well into the development o",2292,"Good morning. We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. Many of the projects announced at the outset of this program in 2007 are either currently in operation or nearing completion, and we are now well into the development of the next round of projects. These investments which we announced last September are spread across all of our regulated lines of business and provide the foundation for our growth in earnings and dividends.
We see the potential for this growth to continue beyond the current 5-year window through the end of the decade. Since we began this program in 2007, we have added over 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity to our Virginia fleet, with the construction of a new combined cycle facility, peaking facilities, as well as upgrades to some of our existing plants.
In May, the 580-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station in Buckingham County began commercial operation and has run for over 60 days without any forced outage or automatic trips. Bear Garden was completed on time and on budget. We will add another 585 megawatts next summer when the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, a coal and wood-burning plant in Wise County is scheduled to begin commercial operation. Virginia City is about 90% complete and is also proceeding on-budget and on-time, with about 2,200 workers on site during this past quarter.
Our next generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia that will provide approximately 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on May 2, and an EPC contract was executed on June 30. EPC contract is fixed-price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns to the company and its customers. Site work has commenced and the final notice to proceed was issued with the manufacturer of the major equipment.
Yet regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014. The estimated cost of the project is $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per kW, which combined with its 6,600 heat rate, provides substantial economic value for our customers.
Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We will provide periodic updates as we refine our growth plans.
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May, and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed-price, was executed on June 30, and we are in the process of contracting with fuel aggregators for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million, and if the projects are approved by regulators, should be completed in 2013.
On the environmental front, as you are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency issued its Cross State Air Pollution Rule earlier this month. In a change from the earlier drafts, the state of Massachusetts, where our Brayton Point Power Station is located, was excluded from the program. The program also excludes Rhode Island, where our Manchester Street Station is located.
We are evaluating our compliance options for our generating fleet in Virginia, including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fired facilities, adding additional transmission capacity, or some combination of all 3. We will discuss our full compliance strategy later this year when we file our integrated resource plan with regulators.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. I'm pleased to announce that both of our major 500kv additions, the Meadow Brook-to-Loudon and the Carson-to-Suffolk lines are in service. Both were completed on/or ahead of schedule and within budget.
Work has began on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the modernization of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line. A hearing before the State Corporation Commission on the Virginia portion of the line was held on June 20, and we expect an order later this year. Work on this project will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $500 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. You should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available in both the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. Before turning to some developments there, let me update you on our midstream expansion projects that arise from the constraint conventional fields in the Appalachian basin.
The Lightburn Extraction Plant, a part of our Gathering Enhancement project, was completed during the quarter. The Charleroi propane truck loading terminal, which provides access to the Pittsburgh market, was placed in-service on June 3. Both projects were completed on time and within budget. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project received approval from FERC last month. Construction will begin this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012.
Now to the shale opportunities. Last quarter, we announced 3 new projects which support Dominion Energy's 5-year growth outlook. These were the Tioga Area Expansion, the Allegheny Storage Project and our letter of intent between Chesapeake Energy and Dominion East Ohio to develop gathering systems to support Chesapeake's activities in the Utica Shale formation.
Our next major project in the Marcellus and Utica regions has been finalized. We have acquired a site on the Ohio River in Natrium, West Virginia to construct a large gas processing and fractionation plant. With the rising price of oil and the depressed price of natural gas, drilling activity in the region has shifted from a dry gas to wet gas areas of formation as producers look to capture the economic value of the natural gas liquids. As a result, the region has a significant need for additional processing and fractionation capacity. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers.
During the second quarter, we executed binding, gathering, processing and fractionation agreements with 3 customers. On July 1, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. This pace of the project is currently over 90% contracted and is expected to be in-service by December 2012. Chesapeake Energy is the largest customer, having a commitment to provide 100 million cubic feet a day.
The Phase 1 cost of Natrium for processing, fractionation, plant inlet and outlet natural gas transportation, gathering and various modes of NGL transportation is approximately $500 million. We can expand the facility to accommodate additional demand for producers and are currently working to secure additional commitments for a second phase of the project. Chesapeake Energy has an existing option for a portion of Phase 2. If the contracts are finalized, we would expand the facility to 400 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 59,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The expansion of the facility would lead to a significant additional investment opportunity for our midstream business.
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin.
At East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25-year, $2.7 billion barrel steel pipe replacement program to nearly double the spending to more than $200 million per year. We have reached a settlement agreement with the commission staff to increase spending by $40 million, bringing the total to $160 million per year. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the Public Utilities Commission. The hearing was held on July 22, and we expect an order in the near future.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. Last quarter, I discussed the record safety performance from our Fossil & Hydro and Nuclear business units. This quarter, I want to highlight the safety performance at our natural gas businesses. Gas transmission's lost-time/restricted duty incident rate for the first half of the year matches its best ever performance. Dominion Hope recorded 0 OSHA reportable or lost-time incidents for the quarter and Dominion East Ohio recorded the best safety performance in over a decade. Cove Point was recognized for its safety and security performance, as well as its community involvement, with awards from the United States Coast Guard and the Southern Maryland Economic Development Association. Our other business units continue to register improving metrics for safety performance.
Moving to operations. Our generating plants performed well in the second quarter. Availability of our Fossil & Hydro fleet has been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieved its best ever forced outage rate. North Anna Power Station and Millstone Unit 3 have operated at 100% capacity through the first half of the year. A spring refueling outage at Millstone Unit 2 was accomplished in a unit record 30 days. A spring refueling outage at Surry Unit 2 included a low-pressure/high-pressure turbine replacement, which was the final portion of the capacity upgrade project, expected to add about 40 megawatts.
The tornado touched down on the site at the outset of the outage, which combined with the valve malfunction, delayed the restart of the unit by about 25 days.
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is at 6%, well below the national average of over 9%, and is only 4.5% in Northern Virginia. New connects have been running below expectations, but sales growth has been strong. Weather adjusted, sales were up 3% in the second quarter after rising 2.1% in the first quarter.
Last Friday, Virginia Power set a new all-time record peak demand of over 20,000 megawatts, an increase of nearly 2% over the previous peak set in August 2007.
Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Through the first half of the year, 5 new data centers have been connected, adding about 12 megawatts of new load to our system. We expect to add another 63 megawatts of new load from data centers by the end of this year. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year, should grow to 545 megawatts by the end of next year and 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year. I've already mentioned the recent filings related to our new growth projects at Warren County and the biomass conversions. Updates for the Riders for Bear Garden and Virginia City were filed on June 27.
Last week, the State Corporation Commission issued an order in our annual commission rate Rider filing, approving an annual revenue requirement of $466.4 million, which fully supports recovery of the cost related to our growth projects. The new rate becomes effective September 1.
On June 27, the State Corporation Commission approved our request to recover over $430 million in deferred fuel costs over a 24-month period rather than the traditional 12-month recovery called for in the statute. Our request for the extended recovery period reflects our desire to mitigate the impact on our customers.
Finally, a few comments about our biennial review. As many of you know, the first biennial review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31, and the SEC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and '10 were within the 100 basis point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from intervenors was filed last week and raised no unexpected issues. Staff testimony is due on August and hearings are scheduled for September 20. Virginia law allow the SEC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings, although the governing criteria, such as the use of a peer group average of earned returns and the inclusion of premiums for operating performance and remitting renewable energy targets still apply.
Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
So to conclude, second quarter earnings were at the high end of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already at the top tier in our industry. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations.
We continue to move forward with our growth plans, completing several major projects and beginning several more. This fall, we plan to provide more details around the next stage of our growth plan, including our plans for Virginia Power to comply with new EPA regulations, the continued build-out of midstream infrastructure in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, and disclosure of longer-dated hedging activities designed to lock in improving margins for our merchant generating fleet.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for",1048,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which were in the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Weather, which boosted earnings for the second quarter of last year by $0.06 per share, added only $0.01 compared to normal. Despite the normal weather, both of our electric business segments delivered earnings at or above the top of the respective guidance ranges. Other factors impacting the results for the quarter relative to guidance were lower interest costs and higher income taxes.
GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share for the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the benefit of a resolution of a lawsuit with the Department of Energy over spent nuclear fuel, offset by severance charges related to the previously announced closing of the Salem and State Line merchant generation plants. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $227 million, near the high end of our guidance range. Higher transmission revenues and a higher contribution from Dominion Retail were principal factors in this strong performance.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $184 million, just above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong contribution from Producer Services offset lower results from our distribution companies.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $372 million for the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Higher ancillary service revenues and higher-than-expected merchant generation margins were the principal favorable earnings drivers. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On our last call, we outlined our financing plans for the remainder of the year, including debt issuances of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. To take advantage of the current interest rate environment, we have hedged treasury rates for $600 million of the debt need for 2011 and have taken a further step of locking in treasury rates related to over half of our 2012 needs.
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also, other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
To offset the impact of bonus depreciation on our earnings, we announced a plan to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million in common stock during the year. To the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares at a cost of about $600 million. We will make a decision of whether or not to repurchase the additional $100 million later in the year.
Now to earnings guidance. Our earnings -- our operating earnings guidance for 2011 is unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% growth beginning in 2012. For the third quarter of 2011, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share, compared to operating earnings of $1.03 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Last year's above normal temperatures added $0.08 per share to third quarter earnings.
Other factors leading to lower third quarter earnings compared to last year include lower expected margins from our merchant generation business and a higher effective income tax rate. Offsetting these factors are higher expected base and rider-related revenues and a lower share count. GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2010 can be found on Page 40 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We have added to our hedges for Millstone in 2013, but have left the 2012 position unchanged from last quarter. Our New England Coal units remain largely unhedged for 2012 and 2013, reflecting the low dark spreads currently available in the debt market. However, we were able to hedge about 10% of our expected output for 2012 due to a rise in power prices for the early months.
The consolidated sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now about $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity for 2012 is still only $0.05 per share.
You should note that we are seeing an uplift in New England power prices as current market prices for 2013 are 3% higher than 2012. Also as Slide 8 indicates, market power prices for 2014 and 2015 are up 6% and 12%, respectively, over 2012. This validates our view that the drop in earnings for our merchant generation business will be in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, we have begun to capture some of the uplift in 2014 and 2015 by layering in some hedges for Millstone in those years. We plan to begin disclosing these longer-dated hedge positions later this year.
So let me summarize my financial review. Earnings for the second quarter of this year were very strong and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units either met or exceeded our guidance. We have hedges in place for a large portion of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have completed $600 million in share repurchases through the first half of the year, and we'll decide whether or not to pursue up to $100 million in additional repurchases later this year. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 remains at $3 to $3.30 per share. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1 per share.
And finally, New England power prices in 2013, '14 and '15 show an encouraging trend that should help support our earnings growth targets going forward. We have begun to capture some of that growth with some longer-dated hedges. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. Many of the projects announced at the outset of this program in 2007 are either currently in operation or nearing completion, and we are now well into the development of the next round of projects. These investments which we announced last September are spread across all of our regulated lines of business and provide the foundation for our growth in earnings and dividends.
We see the potential for this growth to continue beyond the current 5-year window through the end of the decade. Since we began this program in 2007, we have added over 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity to our Virginia fleet, with the construction of a new combined cycle facility, peaking facilities, as well as upgrades to some of our existing plants.
In May, the 580-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station in Buckingham County began commercial operation and has run for over 60 days without any forced outage or automatic trips. Bear Garden was completed on time and on budget. We will add another 585 megawatts next summer when the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, a coal and wood-burning plant in Wise County, is scheduled to begin commercial operation. Virginia City is about 90% complete and is also proceeding on budget and on time, with about 2,200 workers on site during this past quarter.
Our next generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia that will provide approximately 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on May 2, and an EPC contract was executed on June 30. EPC contract is fixed-price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns to the company and its customers. Site work has commenced and the final notice to proceed was issued with the manufacturer of the major equipment.
If regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014. The estimated cost of the project is $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per kW, which combined with its 6,600 heat rate, provides substantial economic value for our customers.
Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We will provide periodic updates as we refine our growth plans.
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May, and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed-price, was executed on June 30 and we are in the process of contracting with fuel aggregators for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million and if the projects are approved by regulators, should be completed in 2013.
On the environmental front, as you are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency issued its Cross State Air Pollution Rule earlier this month. In a change from the earlier drafts, the state of Massachusetts, where our Brayton Point Power Station is located, was excluded from the program. The program also excludes Rhode Island, where our Manchester Street Station is located.
We are evaluating our compliance options for our generating fleet in Virginia, including installing control equipment, replacing some of our existing generation with new gas-fired facilities, adding additional transmission capacity, or some combination of all 3. We will discuss our full compliance strategy later this year when we file our integrated resource plan with regulators.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. I'm pleased to announce that both of our major 500kv additions, the Meadow Brook-to-Loudon and the Carson-to-Suffolk lines are in service. Both were completed on/or ahead of schedule and within budget.
Work has begun on the West Virginia portion of our next major transmission project, the modernization of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line. A hearing before the State Corporation Commission on the Virginia portion of the line was held on June 20, and we expect an order later this year. Work on this project will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $500 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. You should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available in both the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. Before turning to some developments there, let me update you on our midstream expansion projects that arise from the constraint conventional fields in the Appalachian basin.
The Lightburn Extraction Plant, part of our Gathering Enhancement project, was completed during the quarter. The Charleroi propane truck loading terminal, which provides access to the Pittsburgh market, was placed in-service on June 3. Both projects were completed on time and within budget. Our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project received approval from FERC last month. Construction will begin this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012.
Now to the shale opportunities. Last quarter, we announced 3 new projects which support Dominion Energy's 5-year growth outlook. These were the Tioga Area Expansion, the Allegheny Storage Project and our letter of intent between Chesapeake Energy and Dominion East Ohio to develop gathering systems to support Chesapeake's activities in the Utica Shale formation.
Our next major project in the Marcellus and Utica regions has been finalized. We have acquired a site on the Ohio River in Natrium, West Virginia to construct a large gas processing and fractionation plant. With the rising price of oil and the depressed price of natural gas, drilling activity in the region has shifted from a dry gas to wet gas areas of the formation as producers look to capture the economic value of the natural gas liquids. As a result, the region has a significant need for additional processing and fractionation capacity. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers.
During the second quarter, we executed binding, gathering, processing and fractionation agreements with 3 customers. On July 1, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. This phase of the project is currently over 90% contracted and is expected to be in-service by December 2012. Chesapeake Energy is the largest customer, having a commitment to provide 100 million cubic feet a day.
The Phase 1 cost of Natrium for processing, fractionation, plant inlet and outlet natural gas transportation, gathering and various modes of NGL transportation is approximately $500 million. We can expand the facility to accommodate additional demand for producers and are currently working to secure additional commitments for a second phase of the project. Chesapeake Energy has an existing option for a portion of Phase 2. If the contracts are finalized, we would expand the facility to 400 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 59,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The expansion of the facility would lead to a significant additional investment opportunity for our midstream business.
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin.
At East Ohio, the company filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission to accelerate the previously approved 25-year, $2.7 billion barrel steel pipe replacement program to nearly double the spending to more than $200 million per year. We have reached a settlement agreement with the commission staff to increase spending by $40 million, bringing the total to $160 million per year. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the Public Utilities Commission. The hearing was held on July 22, and we expect an order in the near future.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning with safety. Last quarter, I discussed the record safety performance from our Fossil & Hydro and Nuclear business units. This quarter, I want to highlight the safety performance at our natural gas businesses. Gas transmission's lost-time/restricted duty incident rate for the first half of the year matches its best ever performance. Dominion Hope recorded 0 OSHA reportable or lost-time incidents for the quarter and Dominion East Ohio recorded the best safety performance in over a decade. Cove Point was recognized for its safety and security performance, as well as its community involvement, with awards from the United States Coast Guard and the Southern Maryland Economic Development Association. Our other business units continue to register improving metrics for safety performance.
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the second quarter. Availability of our Fossil & Hydro fleet has been better than targets, particularly the utility large coal fleet, which achieved its best ever forced outage rate. North Anna Power Station and Millstone Unit 3 have operated at 100% capacity through the first half of the year. A spring refueling outage at Millstone Unit 2 was accomplished in a unit record 30 days. A spring refueling outage at Surry Unit 2 included a low-pressure/high-pressure turbine replacement, which was the final portion of the capacity upgrade project, expected to add about 40 megawatts.
The tornado touched down on the site at the outset of the outage which combined with the valve malfunction, delayed the restart of the unit by about 25 days.
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is at 6%, well below the national average of over 9%, and is only 4.5% in Northern Virginia. New connects have been running below expectations, but sales growth has been strong. Weather adjusted, sales were up 3% in the second quarter after rising 2.1% in the first quarter.
Last Friday, Virginia Power set a new all-time record peak demand of over 20,000 megawatts, an increase of nearly 2% over the previous peak set in August 2007.
Several new data centers have been put into service or are nearing completion. Through the first half of the year, 5 new data centers have been connected, adding about 12 megawatts of new load to our system. We expect to add another 63 megawatts of new load from data centers by the end of this year. Our data center load, which was 295 megawatts at the beginning of the year, should grow to 545 megawatts by the end of next year and 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year. I've already mentioned the recent filings related to our new growth projects at Warren County and the biomass conversions. Updates for the Riders for Bear Garden and Virginia City were filed on June 27.
Last week, the State Corporation Commission issued an order in our annual commission rate Rider filing, approving an annual revenue requirement of $466.4 million, which fully supports recovery of the cost related to our growth projects. The new rate becomes effective September 1.
On June 27, the State Corporation Commission approved our request to recover over $430 million in deferred fuel costs over a 24-month period rather than the traditional 12-month recovery called for in the statute. Our request for the extended recovery period reflects our desire to mitigate the impact on our customers.
Finally, a few comments about our biennial review. As many of you know, the first biennial review under Virginia's reregulation statute takes place this year. We submitted our filing on March 31, and the SEC must issue an order by the end of November. Our filing demonstrates that our earnings governed by base rates for 2009 and '10 were within the 100 basis point approved range of 11.4% to 12.4%. Testimony from intervenors was filed last week and raised no unexpected issues. Staff testimony is due on August and hearings are scheduled for September 20. Virginia law allowed the SEC to revise the return on equity to be used in future regulatory proceedings although the governing criteria, such as the use of a peer group average of earned returns and the inclusion of premiums for operating performance and remitting renewable energy targets still apply.
Our base rates cannot be changed as a result of this review.
So to conclude, second quarter earnings were at the high end of our guidance range. We continue to improve our safety performance, which is already at the top tier in our industry. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met or exceeded our expectations.
We continue to move forward with our growth plans, completing several major projects and beginning several more. This fall, we plan to provide more details around the next stage of our growth plan, including our plans for Virginia Power to comply with new EPA regulations, the continued build-out of midstream infrastructure in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, and disclosure of longer-dated hedging activities designed to lock in improving margins for our merchant generating fleet.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings",1076,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings by about $0.06 per share, but some of this benefit was offset by lower revenues due to the loss of electric service caused by Hurricane Irene. Restoration cost associated with this hurricane totaled $133 million, and the non-capitalized portions have been excluded from operating earnings. 
The last storm for which we took a nonoperating charge to our electric business was Hurricane Isabel in 2003. 
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the third quarter. About half the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was due to the charges related to Hurricane Irene. Other factors included a write-down of the value of our CAIR-related emission allowances and the incremental inspection expenses at North Anna due to the August 23 earthquake. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to the results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $263 million, near the top of our guidance range of $230 million to $270 million. Favorable weather, management of our normal distribution O&M expenses and the execution of our transmission growth plan supported this strong performance. 
Like other retailers who operate in Texas, our Dominion Retail business was challenged as a result of the extreme heat in July and August. Because we are gauged exclusively in residential in small commercial retail segments, and because of our hedging practices, we are not exposed to wholesale trading losses. However, at times, it was necessary to purchase power at peak prices. Nevertheless, Dominion Retail is still on track to deliver results within the guidance range we disclosed at the beginning of the year.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $168 million, near the top of its guidance range of $145 million to $170 million. Lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $696 million for the third quarter, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $650 million to $710 million. Favorable weather and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 2. 
Overall, we are pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
Moving to cash flow and Treasury activities. Funds from operations was $2.7 billion for the first 3 quarters, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. 
Regarding financing activities, we have completed our financing needs for the year, except for one Virginia Power issue of up to $500 million. We have already locked in Treasury rates for this issue, as well as all of our anticipated debt needs for 2012. 
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also, other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $600 million. We do not plan to repurchase the additional 100 million in common stock we had estimated might be necessary to offset the EPS impact of the current provisions for bonus depreciation. 
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. In September, we amended the pricing and extended the terms of our credit facilities. These facilities, originally set to expire in 2013, 2013, now have termination dates of September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit. 
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $0.58 to $0.73 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. When combined with year-to-date results, this effectively narrows our guidance range for the full year to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. As we have said since May of last year, the scheduled refueling outage at Millstone and an outage at Brayton to tie in one of the new cooling towers will have a negative impact on this year's fourth quarter earnings, in addition to the impact of lower power prices. 
Also, weather contributed about $0.03 per share to last year's fourth quarter earnings. Offsetting these negatives are higher base in rider revenues and a lower share count. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. A reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the fourth quarter and full year 2011 GAAP guidance, can be found on Pages 40 and 41 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges for Millstone in 2012 and 2013, increasing the hedging percentage to 76% and 59%, respectively. Also, as coal prices have softened recently, we were able to add to hedge positions for New England Coal units. 
Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only about $0.04 per share. As shown in Slide 7 and on Page 29 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in prices in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. First, operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units were within our guidance range. We have hedges in place for all of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have added to our hedge positions for our merchant generation fleet, reducing our sensitivity to changing commodity prices. And finally, fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.58 to $0.73 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 is now $3.05 to $3.20 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,141575287,180104,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by mother nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last when",2118,"Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by mother nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last when a particular area was hit by both a significant earthquake and a major hurricane within a 7-day period. While we had time to prepare for Hurricane Irene, there is no advance warning for an earthquake. However, in both cases, Dominion's  employees responded to the emergency safely and professionally, and I'm proud of their efforts. 
On August 23, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the eastern United States. The epicenter of the quake was just 11 miles from our North Anna nuclear power station. Sensors at this station immediately triggered an automatic shutdown of both units, just as they were designed to do. The quake also impacted the transformers that connect the plant to the grid. Diesel generators of the plant powered the necessary safety-related systems until off-site power was restored. Both units at North Anna are shutdown and in safe condition. 
Inspections by engineering since the earthquake occurred have found no significant damage to any nuclear structures, equipment, pipes, valves, pumps, the Lake Anna dam or any safety-related equipment. We have notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Unit 1 is ready for restart as soon as the commission is satisfied that it can be done so safely. Additionally, the fall refueling outage for Unit 2 was advanced and completed during the shutdown and it is also ready for restart. 
Two teams of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have conducted their own walk-downs and posted seismic event inspections. At a public meeting in early October, the NRC said that Dominion responded appropriately after the earthquake shut down the reactors, and that there was no significant damage, despite ground movement that exceeded the levels to which the plant was originally licensed. On October 21, the NRC held another public meeting at which the results of the analysis of the event and the inspection of the plant were discussed. Significant safety margins built into the design of the plant prevented damage to safety equipment. 
After the meeting, a senior NRC official stated that North Anna will probably be allowed to restart within weeks. There is another public meeting scheduled for next Tuesday to present the results of the startup inspection completed by the NRC. 
Hurricane Irene was a massive storm that inflicted significant damage to electric transmission and distribution systems during the weekend following the earthquake. Although we knew the storm was coming, it's path and intensity were unpredictable, While we had originally expected the worst of the storm to hit the southern and eastern areas of our service area, the bulk of the damage actually occurred in and around Central Virginia, where winds in excess of 40 miles per hour continued for more than 17 hours. The storm prompted the second-largest restoration effort in the company's 100-year history, exceeded only by Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Incorporating lessons learned from that storm improved our responsiveness to Irene. About 1.2 million or half of Virginia Power's customers were affected by the storm. More than 7,000 live, troll and support personnel, including 3,100 mutual aid and tree crews, for more than 20 different utilities and contractors, repaired damage at 35,000 work locations and restored service to more than 92% of our customers within just 5 days. 
Compared to our restoration efforts for Hurricane Isabel, we had about 2/3 as many customers affected but restored service at about half the time. We applaud the outstanding work of our employees, and we thank our fellow utilities for their mutual aid personnel.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning as always with safety. Both Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy reported record or improving safety performance for the first 9 months of the year. At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work led to an increase in both OSHA recordables and lost time restricted duty incidents. Our electric transmission business has gone 122 days without an OSHA recordable. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the third quarter. Surry Units 1 and 2, Millstone 3 and Kewaunee achieved capacity factors greater than or equal to 98.7% during the quarter. Before the earthquake, North Anna Unit 1 had been online for 298 consecutive days and Unit 2 for 289 consecutive days. Millstone Unit 3 had been online 409 days through the end of the third quarter. Millstone Unit 2 experienced a 14-day outage due to a leak in the service water piping. 
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is about 6.5%, which is well below the national average of over 9%, and is actually below 5% in northern Virginia. Weather-adjusted sales were up 1.4% through the third quarter and 1.7% if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. 
We expect demand from data centers to grow from 295 megawatts at the end of 2010 to a total of 370 megawatts by the end of this year. Much of which has already been realized through the third quarter. Data center load is expected to grow approximately 545 megawatts by the end of next year, and to approximately 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is about 93% complete, and is proceeding on budget and on time, with about 1,900 workers on site during the quarter. Chemical cleaning of the boilers was completed last month, in preparation for our first fire of the boilers by the end of this year. More than 50% of the systems at the plant had been turned over for testing and commissioning. Initial synchronization is scheduled for early 2012, and commercial operation is scheduled for the summer of next year. 
Our next new generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 -- cycle project in Warren County, Virginia that will provide more than 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPC, Anna and rider applications were filed with State Corporation commission on May 2. And then EPC contract was executed on June 30.
EPC contract is fixed price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns for the company and its customers.
Site work has commenced, and the final Notice to Proceed was issued for the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Once regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014.
The estimated cost of the project is approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per installed KPW.
Combined with its 6,600 heat ray, Warren County will provide substantial economic benefits for our customers. Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We have identified the need for up to 3 additional combined cycle plants similar in size to Warren County project, due to meet demand growth, and another to replace coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations. They will likely have to be retired as a result of proposed new admissions regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less-expensive waste wood as fuel. The year permit applications were filed at the end of May and the CPC and rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed price, was executed on June 30, and we have finalized our fuel aggregator contracts for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million. And once the projects are approved by regulators, it should be completed by 2013.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. The modernization of the Mount Storm-to-Doubs line was approved by the State Corporation Commission last quarter. Work is underway on this project, and will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years and is estimated to cost about $350 million. 
Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $450 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. Recently, our electric transmission operations were ranked first in reliability among all of our peers. Our transmission investments are providing excellent service to our electric utility customers. 
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs project was received this quarter. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012.
We should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available to -- in both the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. 
Last quarter, we announced the Natrium processing project. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers. On July one, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 35,000 barrels of NGLs per day. 
Recently, we executed an agreement with the producer that now fully contracts Phase I of Natrium. This phase of the project is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in service by December 2012. We can also expand the facility to accommodate additional demand from producers. Since we announced Phase 1, interest from producers in the second phase at the site has been strong. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin. We filed a request on September 1 with the Department of Energy for authorization to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. has entered into a Free Trade Agreement. The DOE approved that request on October 7, authorizing for export up to the equivalent of 365 billion cubic feet per year for a 25-year term. On October 3, we filed for approval to export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. This phase of the approval process requires market demand, supply and economic studies to show that the export of LNG is not inconsistent with the public interest. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits. Our application request approval by June of next year, but it could take longer. 
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year as well. As many of you know, the first biennial review on the Virginia 3 regulation statute is taking place. Hearings were held last month, and the State Corporation Commission must issue an order by the end of November. The purpose of the review is to determine, one, whether the company's average earnings for 2009 and 2010 covered by base rates were within the authorized return on equity range of 11.4% to 12.4%; and two, what return on equity will be used in the next biennial review and be incorporated into future project rider filings. Hearings are scheduled to begin in December for State Corporation Commission approval of our Warren County project and, in January, for the proposed biomass conversions. We are confident in the value of these projects bring to our customers and are hopeful for commission approval next year.
So to conclude, third quarter operating earnings were at the midpoint of our guidance range. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations, despite the major earthquake and Hurricane Irene. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings per share growth beginning next year. We also plan to request board approval for an increase of at least 7% in the dividend for 2012. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

We passed final regulations about a month to the middle of December, so they will still become effective starting 2012, which gives you 3 years for compliance and the possibility for an additional year. I know there's lots of things under consideration by the EPA to give some more flexibility on timing. That remains to be. 
Our conclusion for -- the draft regulations and it's pretty consistent, actually, where we thought they would come out as long as a year ago, would it is in our customers' best interest to close our 2 -- several coal plants in Chesapeake, which is in far eastern Virginia. And one of our coal plants in Yorktown and convert one of those smaller plants to gas. 
So we have to deal with the -- regulation, we have 3 solutions: We will put on -- we are expected to put on pollution control at 2 large oil units. That's about $300 million. That will take place over the course of the 2012 through 2015 period. We will seek to convert one of the Yorktown plants to natural gas, too it's a much smaller project. We will enhance or expand our electric transmission projects, adding another $300 million project above and beyond what was already in our plans, to get electricity down in eastern Virginia, to replace the missing coal plants, and then the capacity will have to be covered with a 1,300 megawatt and we expect to be 3 on 1 gas power plant that will be very similar to the Warren County -- identical to the Warren County facility. Just actually, I guess it was this week -- it was either early this week or late last week, we got zoning approval in Brunswick County, Virginia which is south of Richmond, where we would put that plant. So that plant will cost around $1.2 billion. You add that up as $1.8 billion, that will all be spread out over the 2012 through 2016 period."

Second to third quarter's the first we've really seen a full quarter's impact of our voluntary separation program from last year. Remember, that was done very late in the second quarter, so we had some pretty significant quarter-over-quarter changes down. You can continue to see those types of benefits as you go forward. And then we had some timing issues on maintenance, both in our generating units, but mainly in our distribution business. They were focused on the hurricane repairs, not only during the storm period but subsequent to that, as they had to go back and make more permanent repairs. So that pushed some of the normal maintenance that we would've done in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, and some of our outage maintenance as well had some timing impacts there.

Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings",1074,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings by about $0.06 per share, but some of this benefit was offset by lower revenues due to the loss of electric service caused by hurricane Irene. Restoration cost associated with this hurricane totaled $133 million, and the non-capitalized portions have been excluded from operating earnings. 
The last storm for which we took a nonoperating charge to our electric business was hurricane Isabel in 2003. 
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the third quarter. About half the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was due to the charges related to hurricane Irene. Other factors included a write-down of the value of our CAIR-related emission allowances and the incremental inspection expenses at North Anna due to the August 23 earthquake. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to the results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $263 million, near the top of our guidance range of $230 million to $270 million. Favorable weather, management of our normal distribution O&M expenses and the execution of our transmission growth plan supported this strong performance. 
Like other retailers who operate in Texas, our Dominion Retail business was challenged as a result of the extreme heat in July and August. Because we are gauged exclusively in residential and small commercial retail segments, and because of our hedging practices, we are not exposed to wholesale trading losses. However, at times, it was necessary to purchase power at peak prices. Nevertheless, Dominion Retail is still on track to deliver results within the guidance range we disclosed at the beginning of the year.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $168 million, near the top of its guidance range of $145 million to $170 million. Lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $696 million for the third quarter, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $650 million to $710 million. Favorable weather and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 2. 
Overall, we are pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
Moving to cash flow and Treasury activities. Funds from operations was $2.7 billion for the first 3 quarters, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. 
Regarding financing activities, we have completed our financing needs for the year, except for one Virginia Power issue of up to $500 million. We have already locked in treasury rates for this issue, as well as all of our anticipated debt needs for 2012. 
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $600 million. We do not plan to repurchase the additional 100 million in common stock we had estimated might be necessary to offset the EPS impact of the current provisions for bonus depreciation. 
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. In September, we amended the pricing and extended the terms of our credit facilities. These facilities, originally set to expire in 2013, now have termination dates of September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit. 
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $0.58 to $0.73 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. When combined with year-to-date results, this effectively narrows our guidance range for the full year to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. As we have said, since May of last year, the scheduled refueling outage at Millstone and an outage at Brayton to tie in one of the new cooling towers will have a negative impact on this year's fourth quarter earnings, in addition to the impact of lower power prices. 
Also weather contributed about $0.03 per share to last year's fourth quarter earnings. Offsetting these negatives are higher base in rider revenues and a lower share count. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. A reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the fourth quarter and full year 2011 GAAP guidance can be found on Pages 40 and 41 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges for Millstone in 2012 and 2013, increasing the hedging percentage to 76% and 59%, respectively. Also as coal prices have softened recently, we were able to add new hedge positions for New England Coal units. 
Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012, is now only about $0.04 per share. As shown in Slide 7 and on Page 29 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in prices in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. First, operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units were within our guidance range. We have hedges in place for all of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have added to our hedge positions for our merchant generation fleet, reducing our sensitivity to changing commodity prices. And finally, fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.58 to $0.73 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 is now $3.05 to $3.20 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,141575287,180229,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by mother nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, whe",2118,"Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by mother nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, when a particular area was hit by both a significant earthquake and a major hurricane within a 7-day period. While we had time to prepare for hurricane Irene, there is no advance warning for an earthquake. However, in both cases, Dominion's  employees responded to the emergency safely and professionally, and I'm proud of their efforts. 
On August 23, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the eastern United States. The epicenter of the quake was just 11 miles from our North Anna nuclear power station. Sensors at this station immediately triggered an automatic shutdown of both units, just as they were designed to do. The quake also impacted the transformers that connect the plant to the grid. Diesel generators of the plant powered the necessary safety-related systems until off-site power was restored. Both units at North Anna are shutdown and in safe condition. 
Inspections by engineering since the earthquake occurred have found no significant damage to any nuclear structures, equipment, pipes, valves, pumps, the Lake Anna dam or any safety-related equipment. We have notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Unit 1 is ready for restart as soon as the commission is satisfied that it can be done so safely. Additionally, the fall refueling outage for Unit 2 was advanced and completed during the shutdown and it is also ready for restart. 
Two teams of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have conducted their own walk-downs and posted seismic event inspections. At a public meeting in early October, the NRC said that Dominion responded appropriately after the earthquake shut down the reactors, and that there was no significant damage, despite ground movement that exceeded the levels to which the plant was originally licensed. On October 21, the NRC held another public meeting, at which the results of the analysis of the event and the inspection of the plant were discussed. Significant safety margins built into the design of the plant prevented damage to safety equipment. 
After the meeting, a senior NRC official stated that North Anna will probably be allowed to restart within weeks. There is another public meeting scheduled for next Tuesday to present the results of the startup inspection completed by the NRC. 
Hurricane Irene was a massive storm that inflicted significant damage to our electric transmission and distribution systems during the weekend following the earthquake. Although we knew the storm was coming, it's path and intensity were unpredictable, While we had originally expected the worst of the storm to hit the southern and eastern areas of our service area, the bulk of the damage actually occurred in and around Central Virginia, where winds in excess of 40 miles per hour continued for more than 17 hours. The storm prompted the second-largest restoration effort in the company's 100-year history, exceeded only by hurricane Isabel in 2003. The incorporating lessons learned from that storm improved our responsiveness to Irene. About 1.2 million or half of Virginia Power's customers were affected by the storm. More than 7,000 line, patrol and support personnel, including 3,100 mutual aid and tree crews, for more than 20 different utilities and contractors repaired damage at 35,000 work locations and restored service to more than 92% of our customers within just 5 days. 
Compared to our restoration efforts for Hurricane Isabel, we had about 2/3 as many customers affected but restored service in about half the time. We applaud the outstanding work of our employees, and we thank our fellow utilities for their mutual aid personnel.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning as always, with safety. Both Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy reported record for improving safety performance for the first 9 months of the year. At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work led to an increase in both OSHA recordables and lost time restricted duty incidents. Our electric transmission business has gone 122 days without an OSHA recordable. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the third quarter. Surry Units 1 and 2, Millstone 3 and Kewaunee achieved capacity factors greater than or equal to 98.7% during the quarter. Before the earthquake, North Anna Unit 1 had been online for 298 consecutive days, and Unit 2 for 289 consecutive days. Millstone Unit 3 had been online 409 days through the end of the third quarter. Millstone Unit 2 experienced a 14-day outage due to a leak in the service water piping. 
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is about 6.5%, which is well below the national average of over 9%, and is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia. Weather-adjusted sales were up 1.4% through the third quarter and 1.7% if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. 
We expect demand from data centers to grow from 295 megawatts at the end of 2010, to a total of 370 megawatts by the end of this year. Much of which has already been realized through the third quarter. Data center load is expected to grow approximately 545 megawatts by the end of next year, and to approximately 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is about 93% complete, and is proceeding on budget and on time, with about 1,900 workers on-site during the quarter. Chemical cleaning of the boilers was completed last month, in preparation for our first fire of the boilers by the end of this year. More than 50% of the systems at the plant have been turned over for testing and commissioning. Initial synchronization is scheduled for early 2012, and commercial operation is scheduled for the summer of next year. 
Our next new generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-in-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia, that will provide more than 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with State Corporation Commission on May 2. And an EPC contract was executed on June 30.
EPC contract is fixed price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns to the company and its customers.
Site work has commenced, and the final Notice to Proceed was issued for the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Once regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014.
The estimated cost of the project is approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per installed KW.
Combined with its 6,600 heat rate, Warren County will provide substantial economic benefit for our customers. Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We have identified the need for up to 3 additional combined cycle plants similar in size to the Warren County project, 2 to meet demand growth, and another to replace coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations. They will likely have to be retired as a result of proposed new emissions regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less-expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May, and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed price, was executed on June 30, and we have finalized our fuel aggregator contracts for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million. And once the projects are approved by regulators, it should be completed in 2013.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. The modernization of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line was approved by the State Corporation Commission last quarter. Work is underway on this project, and will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. 
Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $450 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. Recently, our electric transmission operations were ranked first in reliability among all of our peers. Our transmission investments are providing excellent service to our electric utility customers. 
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs project was received this quarter. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012.
We should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available to -- in both the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. 
Last quarter, we announced the Natrium processing project. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers. On July one, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and fractionate 35,000 barrels of NGLs per day. 
Recently, we executed an agreement with the producer that now fully contracts Phase I of Natrium. This phase of the project is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in service by December 2012. We can also expand the facility to accommodate additional demand from producers. Since we announced Phase I, interest from producers in the second phase at the site has been strong. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which could be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin. We filed a request on September 1 with the Department of Energy for authorization to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. has entered into a Free Trade Agreement. The DOE approved that request on October 7, authorizing for export up to the equivalent of 365 billion cubic feet per year for a 25-year term. On October 3, we filed for approval to export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. This phase of the approval process requires market demand, supply and economic studies to show that the export of LNG is not inconsistent with the public interest. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits. Our application request approval by June of next year, but it could take longer. 
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year as well. As many of you know, the first biennial review on the Virginia's reregulation statute is taking place. Hearings were held last month, and the State Corporation Commission must issue an order by the end of November. The purpose of the review is to determine: One, whether the company's average earnings for 2009 and 2010 covered by base rates were within the authorized return on equity range of 11.4% to 12.4%; and two, what returned on equity will be used in the next biennial review and be incorporated into future project Rider filings. Hearings are scheduled to begin in December for State Corporation Commission approval of our Warren County project and in January, for the proposed biomass conversions. We are confident in the value of these projects bring to our customers and are hopeful for commission approval next year.
So to conclude, third quarter operating earnings were at the midpoint of our guidance range. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations, despite the major earthquake and Hurricane Irene. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings per share growth beginning next year. We also plan to request board approval for an increase of at least 7% in the dividend for 2012. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

And there's lots of things under consideration by the EPA to give some more flexibility on timing. That remains to be seen. Our conclusion from looking the draft regulations, and it's pretty consistent, actually, where we thought they would come out as long as a year ago, that it is in our customers' best interest to close our 2 -- or several of our coal plants at Chesapeake, which is in far eastern Virginia. And one of our coal plants in Yorktown and convert one of those smaller plants to gas. 
So we have -- to deal with the HAP regulation, we have 3 solutions: We will put on -- or expect to put on pollution control equipment at 2 large oil units. That's about $300 million. That will take place over the course of the 2012 through 2015-period; we will seek to convert one of the Yorktown plants to natural gas, too it's a much smaller project; we will enhance or expand our electric transmission projects by adding another $300 million project above and beyond what was already in our plans, to get electricity down to eastern Virginia, to replace the missing coal plants; and then the capacity will have to be covered with a 1,300 megawatt, we expect to be three-on-one gas-fired plant that would be very similar to the Warren County -- or identical to the Warren County facility. Just actually, I guess it was this week, it was either earlier this week or late last week, we got zoning approval in Brunswick County, Virginia which is south of Richmond, where we would put that plant. So that plant will cost around $1.2 billion. If you add that up, it's $1.8 billion, that will all be spread out over the 2012 through 2016 period."

And then we had some timing issues on maintenance, both in our generating units, but mainly, in our distribution business. They were focused on the hurricane, repairs, not only during the storm period but subsequent to that, is they had to go back and make more permanent repairs.

Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings",1074,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings by about $0.06 per share, but some of this benefit was offset by lower revenues due to the loss of electric service caused by hurricane Irene. Restoration costs associated with this hurricane totaled $133 million, and the non-capitalized portions have been excluded from operating earnings. 
The last storm for which we took a non-operating charge to our electric business was hurricane Isabel in 2003. 
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the third quarter. About half the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was due to the charges related to hurricane Irene. Other factors included a write-down of the value of our CAIR-related emission allowances and the incremental inspection expenses at North Anna due to the August 23 earthquake. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to the results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $263 million, near the top of our guidance range of $230 million to $270 million. Favorable weather, management of our normal distribution O&M expenses and the execution of our transmission growth plan supported this strong performance. 
Like other retailers who operate in Texas, our Dominion Retail business was challenged as a result of the extreme heat in July and August. Because we are gauged exclusively in residential and small commercial retail sales, and because of our hedging practices, we are not exposed to wholesale trading losses. However, at times, it was necessary to purchase power at peak prices. Nevertheless, Dominion Retail is still on track to deliver results within the guidance range we disclosed at the beginning of the year.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $168 million, near the top of its guidance range of $145 million to $170 million. Lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $696 million for the third quarter, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $650 million to $710 million. Favorable weather and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 2. 
Overall, we are pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
Moving to cash flow and Treasury activities. Funds from operations was $2.7 billion for the first 3 quarters, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. 
Regarding financing activities, we have completed our financing needs for the year, except for one Virginia Power issue of up to $500 million. We have already locked in treasury rates for this issue, as well as all of our anticipated debt needs for 2012. 
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $600 million. We do not plan to repurchase the additional 100 million in common stock we had estimated might be necessary to offset the EPS impact of the current provisions for bonus depreciation. 
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. In September, we amended the pricing and extended the terms of our credit facilities. These facilities, originally set to expire in 2013, now have termination dates of September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit. 
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $0.58 to $0.73 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. When combined with year-to-date results, this effectively narrows our guidance range for the full year to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. As we have said, since May of last year, a scheduled refueling outage at Millstone and an outage at Brayton to tie in one of the new cooling towers will have a negative impact on this year's fourth quarter earnings, in addition to the impact of lower power prices. 
Also weather contributed about $0.03 per share to last year's fourth quarter earnings. Offsetting these negatives are higher base in rider revenues and a lower share count. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. A reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the fourth quarter and full year 2011 GAAP guidance can be found on Pages 40 and 41 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges for Millstone in 2012 and 2013, increasing the hedging percentage to 76% and 59%, respectively. Also as coal prices have softened recently, we were able to add to hedge positions for New England Coal units. 
Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012, is now only about $0.04 per share. As shown in Slide 7 and on Page 29 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in prices in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. First, operating earnings for the third quarter this year were at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units were within our guidance range. We have hedges in place for all of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have added to our hedge positions for our merchant generation fleet, reducing our sensitivity to changing commodity prices. And finally, fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.58 to $0.73 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 is now $3.05 to $3.20 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by Mother Nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, whe",2114,"Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by Mother Nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, when a particular area was hit by both a significant earthquake and a major hurricane within a 7-day period. While we had time to prepare for hurricane Irene, there is no advance warning for an earthquake. However, in both cases, Dominion's employees responded to the emergency safely and professionally, and I'm proud of their efforts. 
On August 23, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the eastern United States. The epicenter of the quake was just 11 miles from our North Anna nuclear power station. Sensors at this station immediately triggered an automatic shutdown of both units, just as they were designed to do. The quake also impacted the transformers that connect the plant to the grid. Diesel generators at the plant powered the necessary safety-related systems until off-site power was restored. Both units at North Anna are shut down and in safe condition. 
Inspections by engineering since the earthquake occurred have found no significant damage to any nuclear structures, equipment, pipes, valves, pumps, the Lake Anna dam or any safety-related equipment. We have notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Unit 1 is ready for restart as soon as the Commission is satisfied that it can be done so safely. Additionally, the fall refueling outage for Unit 2 was advanced and completed during the shutdown and it is also ready for restart. 
Two teams of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have conducted their own walk-downs and posted seismic event inspections. At a public meeting in early October, the NRC said that Dominion responded appropriately after the earthquake shut down the reactors and that there was no significant damage, despite ground movement that exceeded the levels to which the plant was originally licensed. On October 21, the NRC held another public meeting, at which the results of the analysis of the event and the inspection of the plant were discussed. Significant safety margins built into the design of the plant prevented damage to safety equipment. 
After the meeting, a senior NRC official stated that North Anna will probably be allowed to restart within weeks. There is another public meeting scheduled for next Tuesday to present the results of the startup inspection completed by the NRC. 
Hurricane Irene was a massive storm that inflicted significant damage to our electric transmission and distribution systems during the weekend following the earthquake. Although we knew the storm was coming, it's path and intensity were unpredictable. While we had originally expected the worst of the storm to hit the southern and eastern areas of our service area, the bulk of the damage actually occurred in and around Central Virginia, where winds in excess of 40 miles per hour continued for more than 17 hours. The storm prompted the second-largest restoration effort in the company's 100-year history, exceeded only by hurricane Isabel in 2003. The incorporating lessons learned from that storm improved our responsiveness to Irene. About 1.2 million, or half of Virginia Power's customers, were affected by the storm. More than 7,000 line, patrol and support personnel, including 3,100 mutual aid and tree crews, for more than 20 different utilities and contractors repaired damage at 35,000 work locations and restored service to more than 92% of our customers within just 5 days. 
Compared to our restoration efforts for Hurricane Isabel, we had about 2/3 as many customers affected but restored service in about half the time. We applaud the outstanding work of our employees, and we thank our fellow utilities for their mutual aid personnel.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning as always, with safety. Both Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy reported record for improving safety performance for the first 9 months of the year. At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work led to an increase in both OSHA recordables and lost time restricted duty incidents. Our electric transmission business has gone 122 days without an OSHA recordable. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the third quarter. Surry Units 1 and 2, Millstone 3 and Kewaunee achieved capacity factors greater than or equal to 98.7% during the quarter. Before the earthquake, North Anna Unit 1 had been online for 298 consecutive days, and Unit 2 for 289 consecutive days. Millstone Unit 3 had been online 409 days through the end of the third quarter. Millstone Unit 2 experienced a 14-day outage due to a leak in the service water piping. 
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is about 6.5%, which is well below the national average of over 9%, and is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia. Weather-adjusted sales were up 1.4% through the third quarter and 1.7% if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. 
We expect demand from data centers to grow from 295 megawatts at the end of 2010, to a total of 370 megawatts by the end of this year. Much of which has already been realized through the third quarter. Data center load is expected to grow approximately 545 megawatts by the end of next year, and to approximately 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is about 93% complete, and is proceeding on-budget and on-time, with about 1,900 workers on-site during the quarter. Chemical cleaning of the boilers was completed last month, in preparation for a first-fire of the boilers by the end of this year. More than 50% of the systems at the plant have been turned over for testing and commissioning. Initial synchronization is scheduled for early 2012, and commercial operation is scheduled for the summer of next year. 
Our next new generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia, that will provide more than 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with State Corporation Commission on May 2. And an EPC contract was executed on June 30. EPC contract is fixed-price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns to the company and its customers.
Site work has commenced, and the final Notice to Proceed was issued for the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Once regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014.
The estimated cost of the project is approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per installed KW.
Combined with its 6,600 heat rate, Warren County will provide substantial economic benefit for our customers. Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We have identified the need for up to 3 additional combined cycle plants similar in size to the Warren County project, 2 to meet demand growth, and another to replace coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations. They will likely have to be retired as a result of proposed new emissions regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less-expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May, and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed-price, was executed on June 30, and we have finalized our fuel aggregator contracts for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million. And once the projects are approved by regulators, it should be completed in 2013.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. The modernization of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line was approved by the State Corporation Commission last quarter. Work is underway on this project, and will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. 
Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $450 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. Recently, our electric transmission operations were ranked first in reliability among all of our peers. Our transmission investments are providing excellent service to our electric utility customers. 
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs project was received this quarter. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012.
We should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available to -- in both the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. 
Last quarter, we announced the Natrium processing project. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers. On July 1, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. 
Recently, we executed an agreement with the producer that now fully contracts Phase I of Natrium. This phase of the project is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in service by December 2012. We can also expand the facility to accommodate additional demand from producers. Since we announced Phase I, interest from producers in the second phase at the site has been strong. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which could be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin. We filed a request on September 1 with the Department of Energy for authorization to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. has entered into a Free Trade Agreement. The DOE approved that request on October 7, authorizing for export up to the equivalent of 365 billion cubic feet per year for a 25-year term. On October 3, we filed for approval to export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. This phase of the approval process requires market demand, supply and economic studies to show that the export of LNG is not inconsistent with the public interest. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits. Our application requests approval by June of next year, but it could take longer. 
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year as well. As many of you know, the first biennial review on the Virginia's reregulation statute is taking place. Hearings were held last month, and the State Corporation Commission must issue an order by the end of November. The purpose of the review is to determine: One, whether the company's average earnings for 2009 and 2010 covered by base rates were within the authorized return on equity range of 11.4% to 12.4%; and two, what returned on equity will be used in the next biennial review and be incorporated into future project Rider filings. Hearings are scheduled to begin in December for State Corporation Commission approval of our Warren County project and in January, for the proposed biomass conversions. We are confident in the value of these projects bring to our customers and are hopeful for commission approval next year.
So to conclude, third quarter operating earnings were at the midpoint of our guidance range. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations, despite the major earthquake and Hurricane Irene. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings per share growth beginning next year. We also plan to request board approval for an increase of at least 7% in the dividend for 2012. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

And there's lots of things under consideration by the EPA to give some more flexibility on timing. That remains to be seen. Our conclusion from looking the draft regulations, and it's pretty consistent, actually, where we thought they would come out as long as a year ago, that it is in our customers' best interest to close our 2 -- or several of our coal plants at Chesapeake, which is in far eastern Virginia. And one of our coal plants in Yorktown and convert one of those smaller plants to gas. So we have -- to deal with the HAP regulation, we have 3 solutions: We will put on -- or expect to put on pollution control equipment at 2 large oil units. That's about $300 million. That will take place over the course of the 2012 through 2015-period; we will seek to convert one of the Yorktown plants to natural gas, it's a much smaller project; we will enhance or expand our electric transmission projects by adding another $300 million project above and beyond what was already in our plans, to get electricity down to eastern Virginia, to replace the missing coal plants; and then the capacity will have to be covered with a 1,300 megawatt, we expect to be three-on-one gas-fired plant that would be very similar to the Warren County -- or identical to the Warren County facility. Just actually, I guess it was this week, it was either earlier this week or late last week, we got zoning approval in Brunswick County, Virginia which is south of Richmond, where we would put that plant. So that plant will cost around $1.2 billion. If you add that up, it's $1.8 billion, that will all be spread out over the 2012 through 2016 period."

Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we were able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.

Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings",1074,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Dominion had a strong third quarter. Operating earnings were $0.95 per share, which were at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Weather helped the quarter's earnings by about $0.06 per share, but some of this benefit was offset by lower revenues due to the loss of electric service caused by hurricane Irene. Restoration costs associated with this hurricane totaled $133 million, and the non-capitalized portions have been excluded from operating earnings. 
The last storm for which we took a non-operating charge to our electric business was hurricane Isabel in 2003. 
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the third quarter. About half the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was due to the charges related to hurricane Irene. Other factors included a write-down of the value of our CAIR-related emission allowances and the incremental inspection expenses at North Anna due to the August 23 earthquake. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to the results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $263 million, near the top of our guidance range of $230 million to $270 million. Favorable weather, management of our normal distribution O&M expenses and the execution of our transmission growth plan supported this strong performance. 
Like other retailers who operate in Texas, our Dominion Retail business was challenged as a result of the extreme heat in July and August. Because we are gauged exclusively in residential and small commercial retail sales, and because of our hedging practices, we are not exposed to wholesale trading losses. However, at times, it was necessary to purchase power at peak prices. Nevertheless, Dominion Retail is still on track to deliver results within the guidance range we disclosed at the beginning of the year.
EBIT for Dominion Energy was $168 million, near the top of its guidance range of $145 million to $170 million. Lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $696 million for the third quarter, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $650 million to $710 million. Favorable weather and lower-than-planned O&M expenses were partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 2. 
Overall, we are pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
Moving to cash flow and Treasury activities. Funds from operations was $2.7 billion for the first 3 quarters, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. 
Regarding financing activities, we have completed our financing needs for the year, except for one Virginia Power issue of up to $500 million. We have already locked in treasury rates for this issue, as well as all of our anticipated debt needs for 2012. 
As a reminder, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2011. Also other than the potential issuance of up to $300 million of stock through our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan, we do not plan to issue any net common stock in 2012. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $600 million. We do not plan to repurchase the additional 100 million in common stock we had estimated might be necessary to offset the EPS impact of the current provisions for bonus depreciation. 
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. In September, we amended the pricing and extended the terms of our credit facilities. These facilities, originally set to expire in 2013, now have termination dates of September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit. 
Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $0.58 to $0.73 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. When combined with year-to-date results, this effectively narrows our guidance range for the full year to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. As we have said, since May of last year, a scheduled refueling outage at Millstone and an outage at Brayton to tie in one of the new cooling towers will have a negative impact on this year's fourth quarter earnings, in addition to the impact of lower power prices. 
Also weather contributed about $0.03 per share to last year's fourth quarter earnings. Offsetting these negatives are higher base in rider revenues and a lower share count. We continue to expect annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% beginning in 2012. A reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the fourth quarter and full year 2011 GAAP guidance can be found on Pages 40 and 41 of the earnings release kit.
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges for Millstone in 2012 and 2013, increasing the hedging percentage to 76% and 59%, respectively. Also as coal prices have softened recently, we were able to add to hedge positions for New England Coal units. 
Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012, is now only about $0.04 per share. As shown in Slide 7 and on Page 29 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in prices in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. First, operating earnings for the third quarter this year were at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating results for each of our 3 business units were within our guidance range. We have hedges in place for all of our remaining debt needs for this year and next. We have added to our hedge positions for our merchant generation fleet, reducing our sensitivity to changing commodity prices. And finally, fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.58 to $0.73 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2011 is now $3.05 to $3.20 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,141575287,180771,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by Mother Nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, whe",2115,"Good morning. During the third quarter, Dominion's employees were twice challenged by Mother Nature, not just in the same quarter, but actually during the same week. We've done some research and cannot find an occasion during this century or the last, when a particular area was hit by both a significant earthquake and a major hurricane within a 7-day period. While we had time to prepare for hurricane Irene, there is no advance warning for an earthquake. However, in both cases, Dominion's employees responded to the emergency safely and professionally, and I'm proud of their efforts. 
On August 23, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the eastern United States. The epicenter of the quake was just 11 miles from our North Anna nuclear power station. Sensors at this station immediately triggered an automatic shutdown of both units, just as they were designed to do. The quake also impacted the transformers that connect the plant to the grid. Diesel generators at the plant powered the necessary safety-related systems until off-site power was restored. Both units at North Anna are shut down and in safe condition. 
Inspections by engineering since the earthquake occurred have found no significant damage to any nuclear structures, equipment, pipes, valves, pumps, the Lake Anna dam or any safety-related equipment. We have notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Unit 1 is ready for restart as soon as the Commission is satisfied that it can be done so safely. Additionally, the fall refueling outage for Unit 2 was advanced and completed during the shutdown and it is also ready for restart. 
Two teams of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have conducted their own walk-downs and posted seismic event inspections. At a public meeting in early October, the NRC said that Dominion responded appropriately after the earthquake shut down the reactors and that there was no significant damage, despite ground movement that exceeded the levels to which the plant was originally licensed. On October 21, the NRC held another public meeting, at which the results of the analysis of the event and the inspection of the plant were discussed. Significant safety margins built into the design of the plant prevented damage to safety equipment. 
After the meeting, a senior NRC official stated that North Anna will probably be allowed to restart within weeks. There is another public meeting scheduled for next Tuesday to present the results of the startup inspection completed by the NRC. 
Hurricane Irene was a massive storm that inflicted significant damage to our electric transmission and distribution systems during the weekend following the earthquake. Although we knew the storm was coming, it's path and intensity were unpredictable. While we had originally expected the worst of the storm to hit the southern and eastern areas of our service area, the bulk of the damage actually occurred in and around Central Virginia, where winds in excess of 40 miles per hour continued for more than 17 hours. The storm prompted the second-largest restoration effort in the company's 100-year history, exceeded only by hurricane Isabel in 2003. The incorporating lessons learned from that storm improved our responsiveness to Irene. About 1.2 million, or half of Virginia Power's customers, were affected by the storm. More than 7,000 line, patrol and support personnel, including 3,100 mutual aid and tree crews, for more than 20 different utilities and contractors repaired damage at 35,000 work locations and restored service to more than 92% of our customers within just 5 days. 
Compared to our restoration efforts for Hurricane Isabel, we had about 2/3 as many customers affected but restored service in about half the time. We applaud the outstanding work of our employees, and we thank our fellow utilities for their mutual aid personnel.
I'll now turn to operating results for the quarter, beginning as always, with safety. Both Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy reported record for improving safety performance for the first 9 months of the year. At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work led to an increase in both OSHA recordables and lost time restricted duty incidents. Our electric transmission business has gone 122 days without an OSHA recordable. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well in the third quarter. Surry Units 1 and 2, Millstone 3 and Kewaunee achieved capacity factors greater than or equal to 98.7% during the quarter. Before the earthquake, North Anna Unit 1 had been online for 298 consecutive days, and Unit 2 for 289 consecutive days. Millstone Unit 3 had been online 409 days through the end of the third quarter. Millstone Unit 2 experienced a 14-day outage due to a leak in the service water piping. 
Economic growth continues to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Projected demand growth in Dominion's service territory is the highest in PJM. Unemployment in Virginia is about 6.5%, which is well below the national average of over 9%, and is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia. Weather-adjusted sales were up 1.4% through the third quarter and 1.7% if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. 
We expect demand from data centers to grow from 295 megawatts at the end of 2010, to a total of 370 megawatts by the end of this year. Much of which has already been realized through the third quarter. Data center load is expected to grow approximately 545 megawatts by the end of next year, and to approximately 715 megawatts by the end of 2013.
We continue to move forward on our long-term infrastructure growth plan. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is about 93% complete, and is proceeding on-budget and on-time, with about 1,900 workers on-site during the quarter. Chemical cleaning of the boilers was completed last month, in preparation for a first-fire of the boilers by the end of this year. More than 50% of the systems at the plant have been turned over for testing and commissioning. Initial synchronization is scheduled for early 2012, and commercial operation is scheduled for the summer of next year. 
Our next new generating plant will be a gas-fired 3-on-1 combined cycle project in Warren County, Virginia, that will provide more than 1,300 megawatts when operational. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with State Corporation Commission on May 2. And an EPC contract was executed on June 30. EPC contract is fixed price, which significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns to the company and its customers.
Site work has commenced, and the final Notice to Proceed was issued for the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Once regulatory approvals are received, construction should begin in the spring of next year, and the plant should be in commercial operation in late 2014.
The estimated cost of the project is approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs, or only about $821 per installed KW.
Combined with its 6,600 heat rate, Warren County will provide substantial economic benefit for our customers. Even with the planned addition of the Warren County plant, Virginia Power will still need to construct additional generating capacity to overcome its existing shortfall and to meet the demands of its growing service territory. We have identified the need for up to 3 additional combined cycle plants similar in size to the Warren County project, 2 to meet demand growth, and another to replace coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations. They will likely have to be retired as a result of proposed new emissions regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Virginia Power has also announced plans to convert 3 small generating plants from burning coal to less-expensive waste wood as fuel. The air permit applications were filed at the end of May, and the CPCN and Rider applications were filed with the State Corporation Commission on June 27. An EPC contract, which is also fixed-price, was executed on June 30, and we have finalized our fuel aggregator contracts for each of the facilities. The estimated cost of the conversions is $165 million. And once the projects are approved by regulators, it should be completed in 2013.
The upgrade of our transmission system is a key component of our infrastructure growth plan. The modernization of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line was approved by the State Corporation Commission last quarter. Work is underway on this project, and will be conducted during the spring and fall of the next 3 years, and is estimated to cost about $350 million. 
Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects, totaling about $450 million per year, for at least each of the next 5 years. Recently, our electric transmission operations were ranked first in reliability among all of our peers. Our transmission investments are providing excellent service to our electric utility customers. 
The growth program at our natural gas infrastructure business continues to move forward as well. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began this summer, and the project should be in service by September 2012. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs project was received this quarter. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012.
We should expect to see a focus by us on a variety of midstream investment opportunities available to -- in both the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. 
Last quarter, we announced the Natrium processing project. The Natrium site can access production in both the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, and is able to ship products via barge, rail, truck and pipe, offering significant value to producers. On July 1, we executed an EPC contract for the construction of facilities that can process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. 
Recently, we executed an agreement with the producer that now fully contracts Phase I of Natrium. This phase of the project is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in service by December 2012. We can also expand the facility to accommodate additional demand from producers. Since we announced Phase I, interest from producers in the second phase at the site has been strong. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which could be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin. We filed a request on September 1 with the Department of Energy for authorization to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. has entered into a Free Trade Agreement. The DOE approved that request on October 7, authorizing for export up to the equivalent of 365 billion cubic feet per year for a 25-year term. On October 3, we filed for approval to export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. This phase of the approval process requires market demand, supply and economic studies to show that the export of LNG is not inconsistent with the public interest. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits. Our application requests approval by June of next year, but it could take longer. 
Our regulatory calendar has been fairly active this year as well. As many of you know, the first biennial review on the Virginia's reregulation statute is taking place. Hearings were held last month, and the State Corporation Commission must issue an order by the end of November. The purpose of the review is to determine: One, whether the company's average earnings for 2009 and 2010 covered by base rates were within the authorized return on equity range of 11.4% to 12.4%; and two, what returned on equity will be used in the next biennial review and be incorporated into future project Rider filings. Hearings are scheduled to begin in December for State Corporation Commission approval of our Warren County project and in January, for the proposed biomass conversions. We are confident in the value of these projects bring to our customers and are hopeful for commission approval next year.
So to conclude, third quarter operating earnings were at the midpoint of our guidance range. All 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations, despite the major earthquake and Hurricane Irene. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings per share growth beginning next year. We also plan to request board approval for an increase of at least 7% in the dividend for 2012. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

And there's lots of things under consideration by the EPA to give some more flexibility on timing. That remains to be seen. Our conclusion from looking the draft regulations, and it's pretty consistent, actually, where we thought they would come out as long as a year ago, that it is in our customers' best interest to close our 2 -- or several of our coal plants at Chesapeake, which is in far eastern Virginia. And one of our coal plants in Yorktown and convert one of those smaller plants to gas. So we have -- to deal with the HAP regulation, we have 3 solutions: We will put on -- or expect to put on pollution control equipment at 2 large oil units. That's about $300 million. That will take place over the course of the 2012 through 2015-period; we will seek to convert one of the Yorktown plants to natural gas, it's a much smaller project; we will enhance or expand our electric transmission projects by adding another $300 million project above and beyond what was already in our plans, to get electricity down to eastern Virginia, to replace the missing coal plants; and then the capacity will have to be covered with a 1,300 megawatt, we expect to be three-on-one gas-fired plant that would be very similar to the Warren County -- or identical to the Warren County facility. Just actually, I guess it was this week, it was either earlier this week or late last week, we got zoning approval in Brunswick County, Virginia which is south of Richmond, where we would put that plant. So that plant will cost around $1.2 billion. If you add that up, it's $1.8 billion, that will all be spread out over the 2012 through 2016 period."

First you have to do, is you have to take out Kewaunee out of those numbers. Because remember, year-over-year, Kewaunee is now a non-operating, so we don't have that in there. Second, the third quarter is the first we've really seen a full quarter's impact of our voluntary separation program from last year. Remember, that was done very late in the second quarter, so we had some pretty significant quarter-over-quarter changes down. And you can continue to see those types of benefits as you go forward. And then we had some timing issues on maintenance, both in our generating units, but mainly, in our distribution business. They were focused on the hurricane, repairs, not only during the storm period but subsequent to that, is they had to go back and make more permanent repairs. So that pushed some of the normal maintenance that we would've done in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, and some of our outage maintenance as well, had some timing impacts there. So that's the reason really, for quarter-over-quarter why we're so far down. I would expect a small portion of that to come back, particularly in the distribution business. And to some extent, in the transmission business in the fourth quarter."
