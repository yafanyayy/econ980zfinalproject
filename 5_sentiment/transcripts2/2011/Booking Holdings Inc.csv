33254,119130265,105632,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, and welcome to Priceline's fourth quarter conference call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks. Dan will give the detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion,",507,"Thank you very much, and welcome to Priceline's fourth quarter conference call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks. Dan will give the detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $3.3 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $175 million or $3.40 per share, up 71% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $3.09 per share in our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $22 million for the quarter, up 51% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $13.6 billion, up 47% from 2009 and non-GAAP net income per share of $13.49, a 58% increase over 2009.
Growth rates for our International business decreased slightly during the quarter with 71% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited from increased ADRs. International gross bookings also benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply, strong growth from Agoda and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results. Booking.com continued to make impressive strides in building its business and its worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 120,000 hotels in 99 countries.
Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America is paying off with rapidly growing reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Booking is making substantial investment in people to promote and manage expansion of its hotel and geographic base which is evident in the company's growing hotel count and geographic footprint. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 9% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room night reservations and rental car reservations. Opaque and retail hotel room night booking growth benefited from higher ADRs and our hotel partners continued to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and use our opaque services to bolster occupancy.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 42% reflects growth in the domestic retail and opaque hotel business and growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter and is making good progress with platform and website enhancements and other integration steps.
The growth in the Group's International hotel business has exceeded our forecast for the last few quarters, and both Booking.com and Agoda are building staff to accommodate this growth. The expense associated with this investment, as well as the payoff in terms of topline growth, are visible in our reported results and forward guidance. In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus in execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,119130265,105632,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 topline performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. H",2153,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 topline performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 51% in the fourth quarter as compared to the unit growth rate of 54% we posted in the third quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs dropped by about 3% for our International hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year fourth quarter. FX rates for the fourth quarter were unfavorable to both our guidance and prior year rates, and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 8% and 3%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The strong performance in unit growth drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 44% for Q4 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 65% and by 71% on a local-currency basis for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year Q4. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range as our International hotel business continues to deliver outstanding results and did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our guidance.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010  contributed $55 million in gross bookings in Q4. Rental car-based books were up 65% versus fourth quarter of 2009 including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Domestic hotel room nights posted strong double-digit growth, driven primarily by price disclosed reservations. Airline tickets booked were down by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from decrease in retail airline tickets which adversely impacts gross bookings but has a negligible impact on gross profit. Domestic gross bookings growth of 9% was near the top end of our range of guidance.
The strong performance in gross bookings and some favorability on operating expenses helped drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit was $478 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $374 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our domestic business amounted to $104 million which represented 15% growth versus prior year. Total operating expenses came in lower than our guidance, driven primarily by lower than forecasted online advertising and personnel expenses.
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the fourth quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency.
Personnel expense was slower than forecast for the quarter. In Q4, we actually hired at a faster pace than originally forecast due to the recent and projected growth of the business. As a result, salary expenses came in higher than forecast. However, this unfavorable variance was more than offset by lower than forecasted bonus expense. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3.2 million which is lower than the $6.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging losses than assumed for guidance.
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $223 million which exceeded our guidance range of $200 million to $210 million and represents 67% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit expanded by 390 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q4.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $180 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2010 which represents a 23% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the timing of income tax payments which were significantly higher than prior year fourth quarter. We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter.
We received $43 million of cash in the fourth quarter upon early termination of the convergence spread hedges related to our 2011 bonds. For full year 2010, the Group generated $777 million of cash from operations, representing a 53% increase compared to 2009. We expect to pay approximately $60 million in early 2011 representing the earn out amount to based upon the performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. The Agoda team has done an exceptional job of building a profitable business, focused principally on the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market from a destination and point of demand perspective. As of year-end, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.1 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for first quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecasters reflect exceptional topline performance driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business, as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.36 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. That assumption yields average exchange rates for the first quarter 2011 that will be weaker be 2% for the euro and stronger by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro and the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these Hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 45% to 50%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 7% to 12%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 64% to 69% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 66% to 71%. Our first quarter guidance assumes that the rate of the year-over-year increase for International and domestic hotel ADRs will be similar to the increase as we experienced in Q4. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 47% to 52%. For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $185 million to $190 million, with about $12 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with prior year Q1.
The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand. Our International brands are growing substantially in Q1 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our domestic business.
We expect sales and marketing expense of between $32 million and $36 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $65 million and $69 million. We expect SG&A expenses of approximately $23 million to $26 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $5.5 million for Q1 2011 compared to income of $1 million in Q1 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange loss, net interest expense and the charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to non-controlling interests. We assume that losses will be occurred on our hedge contracts in Q1 2011, since the FX rates assumes for guidance reflect the stronger release euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter when we entered into our FX hedge contracts. We had FX hedging gains in first quarter 2010 as the euro weakened in the latter half of the quarter.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $147 million and $157 million, which at the midpoint represents 36% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience deleverage closed by online advertising expense and personnel expense growing at a faster rate than gross profit, as well as the variance in other income and expense that I just discussed. The EBITDA deleverage is principally caused by the timing difference between the recognition of revenue in certain expenses. Q1 is typically a quarter where online advertising expense and operating expense is in total expressed as a percentage of gross profit by the seasonal high point, and so the impact of these timing differences can be magnified. A significant amount of bookings typically occur in Q1 as customers make travel reservations for spring and Easter holiday in Q2 and summer holidays in Q3.
However, Q1 is typically a relatively less significant quarter of the year from a revenue and gross profit perspective as less travel occurs compared to other quarters of the year. We have grown our headcount significantly since Q1 of 2010 to accommodate the substantial rate of growth that we experienced throughout 2010, and we are continuing to grow our headcount in our worldwide business in order to accommodate the current and future growth. Although the headcount and related expenses are on board in Q1, a substantial amount of our profits will be recorded in Q2 and to an even larger degree in Q3 when the travel takes place.
There is also a mixed impact on consolidated margins from the inclusion of TravelJigsaw and the level of growth achieved by Agoda, which exceeds the growth rates of our other brands. Both of these businesses are less mature than our core booking.com and Priceline brands and consequently have lower operating margins. TravelJigsaw, which will be included in our Q1 results for the first time, in particular has seasonally lower margins in Q1 than our core business. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.34 to $2.44 per share which at the midpoint represents 41% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $26 million comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods, to the more significant growth in International earnings as compared to domestic earnings. We recently received a formal ruling from the Dutch tax authorities that a portion of our pretax earnings in the Netherlands are generated from innovative activities and therefore, qualify for innovation box tax treatments. Earnings that qualify for the innovation box tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the current Dutch statutory rate of 25%. The ruling covers the years 2010 through 2013 and specifies that the benefit these face in over a multiyear period.
We expect that the impact of the innovation box tax will reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate for Q1 and the full year of 2011 by one to two percentage points and the guidance that I just gave for Q1 reflects this assumption. The impact of the innovation box benefit is likely to grow in several years as we perceive through the phasing period. By 2013, all things being equal, we estimate that the innovation box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by up to approximately five percentage points depending upon the level of earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Tuesday's closing stock price of $433.78.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $1.66 to $1.76 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discounts, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to non-controlling interest of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.
We are very pleased with the topline performance of the business delivered in Q4 and inherent in the guidance for Q1. However, as we have emphasized in previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as economic conditions continued to gradually improve. Our guidance assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

So I think the merchant model will continue to be relevant and vibrant here in the United States for some time to come. The agency model is another approach that I think also has been used in the United States with traditional travel agents for a long time and is attractive to consumers here, especially consumers who value the flexibility and the ease of cancellation it affords. So I think that there's room for that model as well. But I think the merchant model is going to continue to do well also."

The government has received the input from the industry and I think it's fair to say if you look at that review and the review by the European community of Google's moving to vertical search in Europe, a lot of the same concerns have been voiced and I think the regulators have a clear view of what some of the issues are for Google's advertisers and those issues become serious simply because of the very significant market share that Google has and its ability should it choose to do so to move business away from the product of advertising customers and towards the products that are proprietary to Google. With respect to ITA, there's also a continued concern about whether ITA's pricing platform would be available to other industry participants who could be viewed as competitors of Google in the future. I think that, that review has been very, very fullsome and I think the industry has done a good job of raising the questions around it. With respect to International revenue and market share by region, that's just not information that we would share. We give information based on International and domestic, but we have not broken it down by regions and we haven't broken down market share by regions either and that's simply for competitive reasons."

The new market growth both as a destination and a point-of-sale for Booking.com in Asia, in particular South America, the Americas in general is at a higher growth rate than in the core markets, and as those markets become a bigger part of the whole business, just as the effect of holding up your growth rates. Agoda continues to perform very well in the Asian market and growing at a high growth rate. That's been helpful in holding up growth rates. So I think it's really the platform, the International Hotel platform that's continuing to grow. You see the hotel count that we published for Booking.com, 120,000 hotels, I think that's up 55% year-over-year. So really, great job by the team at Booking.com in building what was already a very large and widely dispersed hotel network by a very significant amount over 12 months. And so I think it's those kinds of efforts that are helping hold up the growth, as well as the great innovations that our marketing and front end teams do around the world. And then I'll hit the capital expenditure question and then can Dan talk about earnings leverage. With respect to capital expenditures, the $30 million represents an increase. It's been a modest trend up in our CapEx. And as I've said before, we have a simpler job to do than our competition because our platforms run independently. We don't have to make the investments to try to build one platform that suits everybody's different business. The International platform support one line of business only, support hotels in the case of Booking.com and Agoda, and rental cars in the case of the guys at TravelJigsaw. I think the network team that supports all of those business does a good job of getting economies of scale where appropriate. And I also think we have a very good technologists who have been brought up on an entrepreneurial environment and companies very, very careful about what we spend. So I think those are all the factors. I don't think we're underinvested. And as you can see by the growth, that the business has produced over the last three or four years, we've been able to manage that growth without very significantly ramping up our IT spend."

It's a balance between making sure that we are investing enough in these businesses that they are stationed development to make sure that they can capitalize most effectively on the market opportunities that they're facing on the one hand and making sure that they are, overtime, building operating leverage so that they can within a reasonable time period approach the kind of margins on mature businesses are able to achieve. We don't have a forecast or a timeframe for you, but we obviously are comfortable with the balance that we struck between investment in these relatively younger businesses and the prospect for them to improve their margins over time.

With respect to mobile, the business, while still a small percentage of our total business, has grown very rapidly and we are very excited about the products that we have out in the mobile markets and we're very excited to continue to innovate and bring more functionality into the mobile application world and to equally importantly, improve the browsing experience for people that just come to our mobile website. I think a couple of the things that have happened in the marketplace that will probably be interesting, the first is, that if you look at the fourth quarter results for the device manufacturers, it's clear that there is a very, very significant increase in sales in mobile devices in the quarter. A lot of that is holiday gifts and so forth. But they are just continues to be a very significant increase in the number of devices that are out and activated. And I think that, that's going to be impacted positively by the availability of the iPhone on the Verizon platform which will create a whole another category of demand. And you're also having non-Apple manufacturers building tablet devices that are getting good reviews and the Android device has basically, in a very short period of time, grown to be of roughly equal size. So just the significant growth in the number of devices online represents an opportunity for folks like us and for guys that can get good functionality out into the marketplace to participate. With respect to emerging markets, I think that our view is that the mobile platforms will be very important and that it may take a little bit longer for the mobile platforms in those markets to become significant vehicles for commerce. But that over the intermediate timeframe, they have the potential to become more important as a share of total e-commerce just because a higher percentage of consumers in emerging markets are likely to have their primary interaction with the Internet over a mobile device versus a fixed desktop computer at their home or in the office. So I think that the potential there it may take longer to realize, but it actually could potentially be higher than the domestic market share potential."

With respect to Hotwire in Europe, the European market is challenging for opaque hotels because in the United States and especially in large cities, well more than half of the inventories is national brands where star ratings and what you should expect to see in a hotel are very, very well understood. And in Europe, told bit harder because the hotels are all very different and it's hard for the consumer to really know what they're getting without actually knowing more details about the hotel. I think that's going to be a challenge for Hotwire and it certainly a challenge for us as we try to sell opaque hotels to U.S. customers traveling to Europe. It's something we'll keep our eye on.

They are building advertising relationships and we're helping consumers make reservations there. They're getting all of their content from third parties. The content that we have is ours and proprietary to us. So I view them as essentially different things. I think that the barriers to entry in terms of building hotel content are lower for somebody who runs an advertising model because there are a lot of third parties who are willing to allow businesses like metasearch that have advertising platforms access to the content that they've built up over the years. So with respect to businesses that have a lot of customers and can drive well priced leads to online travel agents and people who make reservations, they'll have content as long as they are able to supply reasonably priced leads to the folks who are getting in the content. With respect to somebody who wants to go out to a hotel and build a booking business where the merchant or agency for commission, I think the hill is a lot higher to climb because essentially, they are by definition showing up without any customers and saying, do the work to connect with me and I promise some day I'll bring you a lot of customers, and that's just a little bit of a harder thing to do."

Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $3.3 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $175 million or $3.40 per share, up 71% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $3.09 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $22 million for the quarter, up 51% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $13.6 billion, up 47% from 2009 and non-GAAP net income per share of $13.49, a 58% increase over 2009.
Growth rates for our International business decreased slightly during the quarter with 71% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited from increased ADRs. International gross bookings also benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply, strong growth from Agoda and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results. Booking.com continued to make impressive strides in building its business, and its worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 120,000 hotels in 99 countries.
Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America is paying off with rapidly growing reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Booking is making substantial investment in people to promote and manage expansion of its hotel and geographic base, which is evident in the company's growing hotel count and geographic footprint. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 9% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room night reservations and rental car reservations. Opaque and retail hotel room night booking growth benefited from higher ADRs, and our hotel partners continued to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and use our opaque services to bolster occupancy.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 42% reflects growth in the domestic retail and opaque hotel business and growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter and is making good progress with platform and website enhancements and other integration steps.
The growth in the Group's International hotel business has exceeded our forecast for the last few quarters, and both Booking.com and Agoda are building staff to accommodate this growth. The expense associated with this investment, as well as the payoff in terms of top line growth, are visible in our reported results and forward guidance. 
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus on execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,119130265,105704,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 top line performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. H",2157,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 top line performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 51% in the fourth quarter as compared to the unit growth rate of 54% we posted in the third quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs dropped by about 3% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year fourth quarter. 
FX rates for the fourth quarter were unfavorable to both our guidance and prior year rates and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 8% and 3%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The strong performance in unit growth drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 44% for Q4 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 65% and by 71% on a local-currency basis for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year Q4. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range as our International Hotel business continues to deliver outstanding results and did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our guidance.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010  contributed $55 million in gross bookings in Q4. Rental car days booked were up by 65% versus fourth quarter of 2009 including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Domestic hotel room nights posted strong double-digit growth, driven primarily by price disclosed reservations. Airline tickets booked were down by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from decrease in retail airline tickets, which adversely impacts gross bookings but has a negligible impact on gross profit. Domestic gross bookings growth of 9% was near the top end of our range of guidance.
The strong performance in gross bookings and some favorability on operating expenses helped drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit was $478 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $374 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $104 million, which represented 15% growth versus prior year. Total operating expenses came in lower than our guidance, driven primarily by lower than forecasted online advertising and personnel expenses. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the fourth quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency.
Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter. In Q4, we actually hired at a faster pace than originally forecast due to the recent and projected growth of the business. As a result, salary expenses came in higher than forecast. However, this unfavorable variance was more than offset by lower than forecasted bonus expense. 
Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3.2 million, which is lower than the $6.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging losses than assumed for guidance.
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $223 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $200 million to $210 million and represents 67% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit expanded by 390 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q4.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $180 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2010, which represents a 23% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the timing of income tax payments, which were significantly higher than prior year fourth quarter. We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter.
We received $43 million of cash in the fourth quarter upon early termination of the convergence spread hedges related to our 2011 bonds. For full year 2010, the Group generated $777 million of cash from operations, representing a 53% increase compared to 2009. We expect to pay approximately $60 million in early 2011 representing the earnout amount to based upon the performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. The Agoda team has done an exceptional job of building a profitable business focused principally on the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market from a destination and point of demand perspective. As of year end, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.1 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for first quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflect exceptional top line performance driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.36 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. That assumption yields average exchange rates for the first quarter of 2011 that will be weaker by 2% for the euro and stronger by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 45% to 50%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 7% to 12%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 64% to 69% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 66% to 71%. 
Our first quarter guidance assumes that the rate of the year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will be similar to the increases we experienced in Q4. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 47% to 52%. For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $185 million to $190 million, with about $12 million of that amount being spent for offline advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with prior year Q1. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand. Our International brands are growing substantially in Q1 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our Domestic business.
We expect sales and marketing expense of between $32 million and $36 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $65 million and $69 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $23 million to $26 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $5.5 million for Q1 2011 compared to income of $1 million in Q1 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange loss, net interest expense and the charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts in Q1 2011, since the FX rates assumes for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter when we entered into our FX hedge contracts. We had FX hedging gains in first quarter 2010 as the euro weakened in the latter half of the quarter.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $147 million and $157 million, which at the midpoint represents 36% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience deleverage closed by online advertising expense and personnel expense growing at a faster rate than gross profit, as well as the variance in other income and expense that I just discussed. The EBITDA deleverage is principally caused by the timing difference between the recognition of revenue and certain expenses. Q1 is typically a quarter where online advertising expense and operating expense is in total expressed as a percentage of gross profit by the seasonal high point, and so the impact of these timing differences can be magnified. A significant amount of bookings typically occur in Q1 as customers make travel reservations for spring and Easter holidays in Q2 and summer holidays in Q3. However, Q1 is typically a relatively less significant quarter of the year from a revenue and gross profit perspective as less travel occurs compared to other quarters of the year. 
We have grown our headcount significantly since Q1 of 2010 to accommodate the substantial rate of growth that we experienced throughout 2010, and we are continuing to grow our headcount in our worldwide business in order to accommodate the current and future growth. Although the headcount and related expenses are on board in Q1, a substantial amount of our profits will be reported in Q2 and to an even larger degree, in Q3 when the travel takes place.
There is also a mixed impact on consolidated margins from the inclusion of TravelJigsaw and the level of growth achieved by Agoda, which exceeds the growth rates of our other brands. Both of these businesses are less mature than our core Booking.com and Priceline brands and consequently, have lower operating margins. TravelJigsaw, which will be included in our Q1 results for the first time, in particular has seasonally lower margins in Q1 than our core business. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.34 to $2.44 per share, which at the midpoint represents 41% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $26 million comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods to the more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. We recently received a formal ruling from the Dutch tax authorities that a portion of our pretax earnings in the Netherlands are generated from innovative activities and therefore, qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatments. Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the current Dutch statutory rate of 25%. The ruling covers the years 2010 through 2013 and specifies that the benefit be phased in over a multiyear period. We expect that the impact of the Innovation Box Tax will reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate for Q1 and the full year of 2011 by one to two percentage points, and the guidance that I just gave for Q1 reflects this assumption. 
The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in subsequent years as we proceed through the phasing period. By 2013, all things being equal, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by up to approximately five percentage points depending upon the level of earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Tuesday's closing stock price of $433.78.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $1.66 to $1.76 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.
We are very pleased with the top line performance of the business delivered in Q4 and inherent in the guidance for Q1. However, as we have emphasized in previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as economic conditions continued to gradually improve. Our guidance assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

So I think the merchant model will continue to be relevant and vibrant here in the United States for some time to come.

The government has received the input from the industry, and I think it's fair to say if you look at that review and the review by the European community of Google's moving to vertical search in Europe, a lot of the same concerns have been voiced. And I think the regulators have a clear view of what some of the issues are for Google's advertisers, and those issues become serious simply because of the very significant market share that Google has and its ability should it choose to do so to move business away from the product of advertising customers and towards the products that are proprietary to Google. With respect to ITA, there's also a continued concern about whether ITA's pricing platform would be available to other industry participants who could be viewed as competitors of Google in the future.

The new market",423,"Okay. So with respect to the first question, we're seeing modest deceleration in our business implied in the guidance, and I think some of the factors that we've been pointing out for the last six months or so continued to be at play here. The new market growth both as a destination and a point-of-sale for Booking.com in Asia, in particular South America. The Americas in general is at a higher growth rate than in the core markets. And as those markets become a bigger part of the whole business, it just has the effect of holding up your growth rates. Agoda continues to perform very well in the Asian market and growing at a high growth rate. That's been helpful in holding up growth rates. So I think it's really the platform, the International Hotel platform that's continuing to grow. You see the hotel count that we published for Booking.com, 120,000 hotels. I think that's up 55% year-over-year. So really, great job by the team at Booking.com in building what was already a very large and widely dispersed hotel network by a very significant amount over 12 months. And so I think it's those kinds of efforts that are helping hold up the growth as well as the great innovation that our marketing and front-end teams do around the world. And then I'll hit the capital expenditure question and Dan can talk about earnings leverage. With respect to capital expenditures, the $30 million represents an increase. It's been a modest trend up in our CapEx. And as I've said before, we have a simpler job to do than our competition because our platforms are running independently. We don't have to make the investment to try to build one platform that suits everybody's different business. The International platform support one line of business only, support hotels in the case of Booking.com and Agoda, and rental cars in the case of the guys at TravelJigsaw. I think the network team that supports all of those businesses does a good job of getting economies of scale where appropriate. And I also think we have a very good technologists who have been brought up in an entrepreneurial environment and companies. We're just very, very careful about what we spend. So I think those are all the factors. I don't think we're under-invested. And as you can see by the growth that the business has produced over the last three or four years, we've been able to manage that growth without very significantly ramping our IT spend."

It's a balance between making sure that we are investing enough in these businesses at their stage of development to make sure that they can capitalize most effectively on the market opportunities that they're facing on the one hand and making sure that they are, over time, building operating leverage so that they can, within a reasonable time period, approach the kind of margins our more mature businesses are able to achieve.

With respect to mobile, the business, while still a small percentage of our total business, has grown very rapidly. And we're very excited about the products that we have out in the mobile markets, and we're very excited to continue to innovate and bring more functionality into the mobile application world and to equally importantly, improve the browsing experience for people that just come to our mobile website. I think a couple of the things that have happened in the marketplace that will probably be interesting, the first is that if you look at the fourth quarter results for the device manufacturers, it's clear that there is a very, very significant increase in sales in mobile devices in the quarter. A lot of that is holiday gifts and so forth. But there just continues to be a very significant increase in the number of devices that are out and activated. And I think that, that's going to be impacted positively by the availability of the iPhone on the Verizon platform, which will create a whole another category of demand. And you're also having non-Apple manufacturers building tablet devices that are getting good reviews, and the Android device has basically, in a very short period of time, grown to be of roughly equal size. So just the significant growth in the number of devices online represents an opportunity for folks like us and for guys that can get good functionality out into the marketplace to participate. With respect to emerging markets, I think that our view is that the mobile platforms will be very, very important, and that it may take a little bit longer for the mobile platforms in those markets to become significant vehicles for commerce. But that over the intermediate time frame, they have the potential to become more important as a share of total e-commerce just because a higher percentage of consumers in emerging markets are likely to have their primary interaction with the Internet over a mobile device versus a fixed desktop computer at their home or in the office. So I think that the potential there it may take longer to realize, but it actually could potentially be higher than the domestic market share potential."

I think that over time, that can have an impact on how the large rental car companies allocate inventory to opaque. But I think the more important driver of whether opaque channels have strong inventory is overall fleet capacity, and that's been volatile. And that volatility has been evident in our results, and we expect that volatility to continue. With respect to TravelJigsaw, the growth rates that we're reporting for rental car are driven more by the fact that TravelJigsaw is being included in these quarters for the first time, and there's no year-over-year comp. We're very pleased with the growth we've seen in that business, but we haven't broken it out specifically. And it's not our intention to break it out in the future, but rather to discuss the rental car product broadly speaking internationally and domestically. And that's what you'll see us doing going forward. With respect to Hotwire in Europe, the European market is challenging for opaque hotels because in the United States and especially in large cities, well more than half of the inventory is national brands where star ratings and what you should expect to see in a hotel are very, very well understood. And in Europe, it's a little bit harder because the hotels are all very different, and it's hard for the consumer to really know what they're getting without actually knowing more details about the hotel. I think that's going to be a challenge for Hotwire, and it certainly a challenge for us as we try to sell opaque hotels to U.S. customers traveling to Europe. It's something we'll keep our eye on. It probably would have been a stronger supplier proposition two years ago than it is today."

So question one is, do you see Expedia doing anything different with respect to their competitive positioning? Or do you believe that their efforts to make their platform more efficient and more effective and conversions is bearing fruit? The second question is two parts. With the stock price up so much, some people have their compensation go up materially over the last two years or so. And then with the organization getting so much larger, I fear that there maybe some creeping bureaucracy because that's just a natural thing that happens to organizations. So the second question is, how do you retain senior management when their lives have changed, have gotten a lot more wealthy perhaps? And then, how do you avoid getting bureaucratic and less nimble than you have been in the last five years?"

But I certainly don't have the perception that there was any material change in the amount of share that we took in the market versus prior quarters. So I just can't comment specifically on what they might or might have done to change that relationship. With respect to compensation, we've worked very hard to create an environment around the world where the entrepreneurs who founded the businesses that we joined up would have the independence and the scope to continue building their business and have the financial incentive that they'll benefit significantly if the business does well. And that, in fact, has happened. And we're very pleased to see those incentives working to drive value for our shareholders, and it's one of the things that we worked hardest at, and senior management is making sure that, that independence in ownership is enjoyed by the local management teams. But also everybody understands how all the businesses fit together and see the benefits of working together as a group, which we're down to the benefit of our shareholders over the last four or five years. With respect to bureaucracy, that's just not part of our DNA. We have very little by way of layers of management. And if someone were to criticize the organizational structure of our company, it would be to say that we don't have enough middle management and staff running around the place. So I don't view that as a current risk, although over time, it's a risk for any large organization."

They are building advertising relationships, and we're helping consumers make reservations there. They're getting all of their content from third parties. The content that we have is ours and proprietary to us. So I view them as essentially different things. I think that the barriers to entry in terms of building hotel content are lower for somebody who runs an advertising model because there are a lot of third parties who are willing to allow businesses like metasearch that have advertising platforms access to the content that they've built up over the years. So with respect to businesses that have a lot of customers and can drive well-priced leads to online travel agents and people who make reservations, they'll have content as long as they are able to supply reasonably priced leads to the folks who are giving them the content. With respect to somebody who wants to go out to a hotel and build a booking business where the merchant or agency for a commission, I think the hill is a lot higher to climb because essentially, they are, by definition, showing up without any customers and saying, do the work to connect with me and I promise someday I'll bring you a lot of customers.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $3.3 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $175 million or $3.40 per share, up 71% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $3.09 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $22 million for the quarter, up 51% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $13.6 billion, up 47% from 2009 and non-GAAP net income per share of $13.49, a 58% increase over 2009.Growth rates for our International business decreased slightly during the quarter with 71% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited from increased ADRs. International gross bookings also benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply, strong growth from Agoda and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results. Booking.com continued to make impressive strides in building its business, and its worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 120,000 hotels in 99 countries.Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America is paying off with rapidly growing reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Booking is making substantial investment in people to promote and manage expansion of its hotel and geographic base, which is evident in the company's growing hotel count and geographic footprint. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 9% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room night reservations and rental car reservations. Opaque and retail hotel room night booking growth benefited from higher ADRs, and our hotel partners continued to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and use our opaque services to bolster occupancy.Merchant gross bookings growth of 42% reflects growth in the domestic retail and opaque hotel business and growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter and is making good progress with platform and website enhancements and other integration steps.The growth in the Group's International hotel business has exceeded our forecast for the last few quarters, and both Booking.com and Agoda are building staff to accommodate this growth. The expense associated with this investment, as well as the payoff in terms of top line growth, are visible in our reported results and forward guidance. In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 top line performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 51% in the fourth quarter as compared to the unit growth rate of 54% we posted in the third quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs dropped by about 3% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year fourth quarter. FX rates for the fourth quarter were unfavorable to both our guidance and prior year rates and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 8% and 3%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The strong performance in unit growth drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 44% for Q4 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 65% and by 71% on a local-currency basis for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year Q4. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range as our International Hotel business continues to deliver outstanding results and did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our guidance.TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010 contributed $55 million in gross bookings in Q4. Rental car days booked were up by 65% versus fourth quarter of 2009 including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Domestic hotel room nights posted strong double-digit growth, driven primarily by price disclosed reservations. Airline tickets booked were down by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from decrease in retail airline tickets, which adversely impacts gross bookings but has a negligible impact on gross profit. Domestic gross bookings growth of 9% was near the top end of our range of guidance.The strong performance in gross bookings and some favorability on operating expenses helped to drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit was $478 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $374 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $104 million, which represented 15% growth versus prior year. Total operating expenses came in lower than our guidance, driven primarily by lower than forecasted online advertising and personnel expenses. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the fourth quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency.Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter. In Q4, we actually hired at a faster pace than originally forecast due to the recent and projected growth of the business. As a result, salary expenses came in higher than forecast. However, this unfavorable variance was more than offset by lower than forecasted bonus expense. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3.2 million, which is lower than the $6.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging losses than assumed for guidance.In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $223 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $200 million to $210 million and represents 67% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit expanded by 390 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q4.In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $180 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2010, which represents a 23% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the timing of income tax payments, which were significantly higher than prior year fourth quarter. We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter.We received $43 million of cash in the fourth quarter upon early termination of the convergence spread hedges related to our 2011 bonds. For full year 2010, the Group generated $777 million of cash from operations, representing a 53% increase compared to 2009. We expect to pay approximately $60 million in early 2011, representing the earnout amount due based upon the performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. The Agoda team has done an exceptional job of building a profitable business focused principally on the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market from a destination and point of demand perspective. As of year end, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.1 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.Now for first quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflect exceptional top line performance driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.36 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. That assumption yields average exchange rates for the first quarter of 2011 that would be weaker by 2% for the euro and stronger by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 45% to 50%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 7% to 12%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 64% to 69% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 66% to 71%. Our first quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will be similar to the increases we experienced in Q4. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 47% to 52%. For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $185 million to $190 million, with about $12 million of that amount being spent for offline advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with prior year Q1. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand. Our International brands are growing substantially in Q1 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our Domestic business.We expect sales and marketing expense of between $32 million and $36 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $65 million and $69 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $23 million to $26 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million.We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $5.5 million for Q1 2011 compared to income of $1 million in Q1 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange loss, net interest expense and the charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts in Q1 2011, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter when we entered into our FX hedge contracts. We had FX hedging gains in first quarter 2010 as the euro weakened in the latter half of the quarter.Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $147 million and $157 million, which at the midpoint represents 36% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience deleverage closed by online advertising expense and personnel expense growing at a faster rate than gross profit, as well as the variance in other income and expense that I just discussed. The EBITDA deleverage is principally caused by the timing difference between the recognition of revenue and certain expenses. Q1 is typically a quarter where online advertising expense and operating expense is in total expressed as a percentage of gross profit by the seasonal high point, and so the impact of these timing differences can be magnified. A significant amount of bookings typically occur in Q1 as customers make travel reservations for spring and Easter holidays in Q2 and summer holidays in Q3. However, Q1 is typically a relatively less significant quarter of the year from a revenue and gross profit perspective as less travel occurs compared to other quarters of the year. We have grown our headcount significantly since Q1 of 2010 to accommodate the substantial rate of growth that we experienced throughout 2010, and we are continuing to grow our headcount in our worldwide business in order to accommodate the current and future growth. Although the headcount and related expenses are on board in Q1, a substantial amount of our profits will be reported in Q2 and to an even larger degree, in Q3 when the travel takes place.There is also a mixed impact on consolidated margins from the inclusion of TravelJigsaw and the level of growth achieved by Agoda, which exceeds the growth rates of our other brands. Both of these businesses are less mature than our core Booking.com and Priceline brands and consequently, have lower operating margins. TravelJigsaw, which will be included in our Q1 results for the first time, in particular has seasonally lower margins in Q1 than our core business. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.34 to $2.44 per share, which at the midpoint represents 41% growth over prior year.Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $26 million comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods to the more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. We recently received a formal ruling from the Dutch tax authorities that a portion of our pretax earnings in the Netherlands are generated from innovative activities and therefore, qualify for Innovation Box tax treatment. Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the current Dutch statutory rate of 25%. The ruling covers the years 2010 through 2013 and specifies that the benefit be phased in over a multiyear period. We expect that the impact of the Innovation Box tax will reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate for Q1 and the full year of 2011 by one to two percentage points, and the guidance that I just gave for Q1 reflects this assumption. The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in subsequent years as we proceed through the phasing period. By 2013, all things being equal, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by up to approximately five percentage points depending upon the level of earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Tuesday's closing stock price of $433.78.We expect to report GAAP EPS of $1.66 to $1.76 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.We are very pleased with top line performance of the business delivered in Q4 and inherent in the guidance for Q1. However, as we have emphasized in previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as economic conditions continued to gradually improve. Our guidance assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged.I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

The government has received the input from the industry, and I think it's fair to say if you look at that review and the review by the European community of Google's moving to vertical search in Europe, a lot of the same concerns have been voiced. And I think the regulators had a clear view of what some of the issues are for Google's advertisers, and those issues become serious simply because of the very significant market share that Google has and its ability should it choose to do so to move business away from the product of advertising customers and towards the products that are proprietary to Google. With respect to ITA, there's also a continued concern about whether ITA's pricing platform would be available to other industry participants who could be viewed as competitors of Google in the future.

So with respect to the first question, we're seeing modest deceleration in our business implied in the guidance, and I think some of the factors that we've been pointing out for the last six months or so continue to be at play here. The new market growth both as a destination and a point-of-sale for Booking.com in Asia, in particular South America. The Americas in general is at a higher growth rate than in the core markets. And as those markets become a bigger part of the whole business, it just has the effect of holding up your growth rates. Agoda continues to perform very well in the Asian market and growing at a high growth rate. That's been helpful in holding up growth rates. So I think those are -- it's really the platform, the International Hotel platform that's continuing to grow. You see the hotel count that we published for Booking.com, 120,000 hotels. I think that's up 55% year-over-year. So really, great job by the team at Booking.com in building what was already a very large and widely dispersed hotel network by a very significant amount over 12 months. And so I think it's those kinds of efforts that are helping hold up the growth as well as the great innovation that our marketing and front-end teams do around the world. And then I'll hit the capital expenditure question and Dan can talk about earnings leverage. With respect to capital expenditures, the $30 million represents an increase. It's been a modest trend up in our CapEx. And as I've said before, we have a simpler job to do than our competition because our platforms run independently. We don't have to make the investment to try to build one platform that suits everybody's different business. The International platform support one line of business only, support hotels in the case of Booking.com and Agoda, and rental cars in the case of the guys at TravelJigsaw. I think the network team that supports all of those businesses does a good job of getting economies of scale where appropriate. And I also think we have a very good technologist who have been brought up in an entrepreneurial environment and in companies where we're just very, very careful about what we spend. So I think those are all the factors. I don't think we're under-invested. And as you can see by the growth that the business has produced over the last three or four years, we've been able to manage that growth without very significantly ramping our IT spend."

And we're very excited about the products that we have out in the mobile markets, and we're very excited to continue to innovate and bring more functionality into the mobile application world and to equally importantly, improve the browsing experience for people that just come to our mobile website. I think a couple of the things that have happened in the marketplace that will probably be interesting, the first is that if you look at the fourth quarter results for the device manufacturers, it's clear that there is a very, very significant increase in sales in mobile devices in the quarter. A lot of that is holiday gifts and so forth. But there just continues to be a very significant increase in the number of devices that are out and activated. And I think that, that's going to be impacted positively by the availability of the iPhone on the Verizon platform, which will create a whole another category of demand. And you're also having non-Apple manufacturers building tablet devices that are getting good reviews, and the Android device has basically, in a very short period of time, grown to be of roughly equal size. So just the significant growth in the number of devices online represents an opportunity for folks like us and for guys that can get good functionality out into the marketplace to participate. With respect to emerging markets, I think that our view is that the mobile platforms will be very, very important, and that it may take a little bit longer for the mobile platforms in those markets to become significant vehicles for commerce. But that over the intermediate time frame, they have the potential to become more important as a share of total e-commerce just because a higher percentage of consumers in emerging markets are likely to have their primary interaction with the Internet over a mobile device versus a fixed desktop computer at their home or in the office. So I think that the potential there, it may take longer to realize, but it actually could potentially be higher than the domestic market share potential."

So with respect to the rental car spartan brands, as you call them, there's no question that consolidation in the industry has happened in a real way and that part of the strategy of the major rental car companies is to have a low cost brand associated with a premium brand. I think that over time, that can have an impact on how the large rental car companies allocate inventory to opaque. But I think the more important driver of whether opaque channels have strong inventory is overall fleet capacity, and that's been volatile. And that volatility has been evident in our results, and we expect that volatility to continue. With respect to TravelJigsaw, the growth rates that we're reporting for rental car are driven more by the fact that TravelJigsaw is being included in these quarters for the first time, and there's no year-over-year comp. We're very pleased with the growth we've seen in that business, but we haven't broken it out specifically. And it is not our intention to break it out in the future, but rather to discuss the rental car product broadly speaking internationally and domestically, and that's what you'll see us doing going forward. With respect to Hotwire in Europe, the European market is challenging for opaque hotels because in the United States and especially in large cities, well more than half of the inventory is national brands where star ratings and what you'd expect to see in a hotel are very, very well understood. And in Europe, it's a little bit harder because the hotels are all very different, and it's hard for the consumer to really know what they're getting without actually knowing more details about the hotel. I think that's going to be a challenge for Hotwire, and it's certainly a challenge for us as we try to sell opaque hotels to U.S. customers traveling to Europe. It's something we'll keep our eye on. It probably would have been a stronger supplier proposition two years ago than it is today."

So question one is, do you see Expedia doing anything different with respect to their competitive positioning? Or do you believe that their efforts to make their platform more efficient and more effective and conversions as bearing fruit? The second question is two parts. With the stock price up so much, some people have their compensation go up materially over the last two years or so. And then with the organization getting so much larger, I fear that there maybe some creeping bureaucracy because that's just a natural thing that happens to organizations.

So I just can't comment specifically on what they might or might have done to change that relationship. With respect to compensation, we've worked very hard to create an environment around the world where the entrepreneurs who founded the businesses that we joined up with have the independence and the scope to continue building their business and have the financial incentive that they'll benefit significantly if the business does well. And that, in fact, has happened. And we're very pleased to see those incentives working to drive value for our shareholders, and it's one of the things that we worked hardest at, and senior management is making sure that, that independence in ownership is enjoyed by the local management teams, but that also everybody understands how all the businesses fit together and see the benefits of working together as a group, which we're down to the benefit of our shareholders over the last four or five years. With respect to bureaucracy, that's just not part of our DNA. We have very little by way of layers of management, and if someone were to criticize the organizational structure of our company, it would be to say that we don't have enough middle management and staff running around the place.

They are building advertising relationships, and we're helping consumers make reservations. They're getting all of their content from third parties.

I think that the barriers to entry in terms of building hotel content are lower for somebody who runs an advertising model because there are a lot of third parties who are willing to allow businesses like metasearch that have advertising platforms access to the content that they've built up over the years. So with respect to businesses that have a lot of customers and can drive well-priced leads to online travel agents and people who make reservations, they'll have content as long as they are able to supply reasonably priced leads to the folks who are giving them the content. With respect to somebody who wants to go out to a hotel and build a booking business where the merchant or agency for a commission, I think the hill is a lot higher to climb because essentially, they are, by definition, showing up without any customers and saying, do the work to connect with me and I promise someday I'll bring you a lot of customers.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $3.3 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $175 million or $3.40 per share, up 71% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $3.09 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $22 million for the quarter, up 51% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $13.6 billion, up 47% from 2009 and non-GAAP net income per share of $13.49, a 58% increase over 2009.
Growth rates for our International business decreased slightly during the quarter with 71% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited from increased ADRs. International gross bookings also benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply, strong growth from Agoda and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results. Booking.com continued to make impressive strides in building its business, and its worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 120,000 hotels in 99 countries.
Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America is paying off with rapidly growing reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Booking is making substantial investment in people to promote and manage expansion of its hotel and geographic base, which is evident in the company's growing hotel count and geographic footprint. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 9% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room night reservations and rental car reservations. Opaque and retail hotel room night booking growth benefited from higher ADRs, and our hotel partners continued to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and use our opaque services to bolster occupancy.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 42% reflects growth in the domestic retail and opaque hotel business and growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter and is making good progress with platform and website enhancements and other integration steps.
The growth in the Group's International hotel business has exceeded our forecast for the last few quarters, and both Booking.com and Agoda are building staff to accommodate this growth. The expense associated with this investment, as well as the payoff in terms of top line growth, are visible in our reported results and forward guidance. 
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,119130265,105949,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2011. Q4 top line performance was strong, reflecting only modest deceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 51% in the fourth quarter as compared to the unit growth rate of 54% we posted in the third quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs dropped by about 3% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year fourth quarter. 
FX rates for the fourth quarter were unfavorable to both our guidance and prior year rates and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 8% and 3%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The strong performance in unit growth drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 44% for Q4 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 65% and by 71% on a local-currency basis for Q4 2010 compared to the prior year Q4. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range as our International Hotel business continues to deliver outstanding results and did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our guidance.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010 contributed $55 million in gross bookings in Q4. Rental car days booked were up by 65% versus fourth quarter of 2009 including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Domestic hotel room nights posted strong double-digit growth, driven primarily by price disclosed reservations. Airline tickets booked were down by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from decrease in retail airline tickets, which adversely impacts gross bookings but has a negligible impact on gross profit. Domestic gross bookings growth of 9% was near the top end of our range of guidance.
The strong performance in gross bookings and some favorability on operating expenses helped to drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit was $478 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $374 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $104 million, which represented 15% growth versus prior year. Total operating expenses came in lower than our guidance, driven primarily by lower than forecasted online advertising and personnel expenses. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the fourth quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency.
Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter. In Q4, we actually hired at a faster pace than originally forecast due to the recent and projected growth of the business. As a result, salary expenses came in higher than forecast. However, this unfavorable variance was more than offset by lower than forecasted bonus expense. 
Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3.2 million, which is lower than the $6.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging losses than assumed for guidance.
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $223 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $200 million to $210 million and represents 67% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit expanded by 390 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q4.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $180 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2010, which represents a 23% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the timing of income tax payments, which were significantly higher than prior year fourth quarter. We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter.
We received $43 million of cash in the fourth quarter upon early termination of the convergence spread hedges related to our 2011 bonds. For full year 2010, the Group generated $777 million of cash from operations, representing a 53% increase compared to 2009. We expect to pay approximately $60 million in early 2011, representing the earnout amount due based upon the performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. The Agoda team has done an exceptional job of building a profitable business focused principally on the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market from a destination and point of demand perspective. As of year end, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.1 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for first quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflect exceptional top line performance driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.36 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. That assumption yields average exchange rates for the first quarter of 2011 that would be weaker by 2% for the euro and stronger by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 45% to 50%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 7% to 12%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 64% to 69% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 66% to 71%. 
Our first quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will be similar to the increases we experienced in Q4. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 47% to 52%. For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $185 million to $190 million, with about $12 million of that amount being spent for offline advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with prior year Q1. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand. Our International brands are growing substantially in Q1 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our Domestic business.
We expect sales and marketing expense of between $32 million and $36 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $65 million and $69 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $23 million to $26 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $5.5 million for Q1 2011 compared to income of $1 million in Q1 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange loss, net interest expense and the charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts in Q1 2011, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter when we entered into our FX hedge contracts. We had FX hedging gains in first quarter 2010 as the euro weakened in the latter half of the quarter.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $147 million and $157 million, which at the midpoint represents 36% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience deleverage closed by online advertising expense and personnel expense growing at a faster rate than gross profit, as well as the variance in other income and expense that I just discussed. The EBITDA deleverage is principally caused by the timing difference between the recognition of revenue and certain expenses. Q1 is typically a quarter where online advertising expense and operating expense is in total expressed as a percentage of gross profit by the seasonal high point, and so the impact of these timing differences can be magnified. A significant amount of bookings typically occur in Q1 as customers make travel reservations for spring and Easter holidays in Q2 and summer holidays in Q3. However, Q1 is typically a relatively less significant quarter of the year from a revenue and gross profit perspective as less travel occurs compared to other quarters of the year. 
We have grown our headcount significantly since Q1 of 2010 to accommodate the substantial rate of growth that we experienced throughout 2010, and we are continuing to grow our headcount in our worldwide business in order to accommodate the current and future growth. Although the headcount and related expenses are on board in Q1, a substantial amount of our profits will be reported in Q2 and to an even larger degree, in Q3 when the travel takes place.
There is also a mixed impact on consolidated margins from the inclusion of TravelJigsaw and the level of growth achieved by Agoda, which exceeds the growth rates of our other brands. Both of these businesses are less mature than our core Booking.com and Priceline brands and consequently, have lower operating margins. TravelJigsaw, which will be included in our Q1 results for the first time, in particular has seasonally lower margins in Q1 than our core business. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.34 to $2.44 per share, which at the midpoint represents 41% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $26 million comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods to the more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. We recently received a formal ruling from the Dutch tax authorities that a portion of our pretax earnings in the Netherlands are generated from innovative activities and therefore, qualify for Innovation Box tax treatment. Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the current Dutch statutory rate of 25%. The ruling covers the years 2010 through 2013 and specifies that the benefit be phased in over a multiyear period. We expect that the impact of the Innovation Box tax will reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate for Q1 and the full year of 2011 by one to two percentage points, and the guidance that I just gave for Q1 reflects this assumption. 
The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in subsequent years as we proceed through the phasing period. By 2013, all things being equal, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by up to approximately five percentage points depending upon the level of earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Tuesday's closing stock price of $433.78.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $1.66 to $1.76 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.
We are very pleased with top line performance of the business delivered in Q4 and inherent in the guidance for Q1. However, as we have emphasized in previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as economic conditions continued to gradually improve. Our guidance assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

The government has received the input from the industry, and I think it's fair to say if you look at that review and the review by the European community of Google's moving to vertical search in Europe, a lot of the same concerns have been voiced. And I think the regulators had a clear view of what some of the issues are for Google's advertisers, and those issues become serious simply because of the very significant market share that Google has and its ability should it choose to do so to move business away from the product of advertising customers and towards the products that are proprietary to Google. With respect to ITA, there's also a continued concern about whether ITA's pricing platform would be available to other industry participants who could be viewed as competitors of Google in the future.

So with respect to the first question, we're seeing modest deceleration in our business implied in the guidance, and I think some of the factors that we've been pointing out for the last six months or so continue to be at play here. The new market growth both as a destination and a point-of-sale for Booking.com in Asia, in particular South America. The Americas in general is at a higher growth rate than in the core markets. And as those markets become a bigger part of the whole business, it just has the effect of holding up your growth rates. Agoda continues to perform very well in the Asian market and growing at a high growth rate. That's been helpful in holding up growth rates. So I think those are -- it's really the platform, the International Hotel platform that's continuing to grow. You see the hotel count that we published for Booking.com, 120,000 hotels. I think that's up 55% year-over-year. So really, great job by the team at Booking.com in building what was already a very large and widely dispersed hotel network by a very significant amount over 12 months. And so I think it's those kinds of efforts that are helping hold up the growth as well as the great innovation that our marketing and front-end teams do around the world. And then I'll hit the capital expenditure question and Dan can talk about earnings leverage. With respect to capital expenditures, the $30 million represents an increase. It's been a modest trend up in our CapEx. And as I've said before, we have a simpler job to do than our competition because our platforms run independently. We don't have to make the investment to try to build one platform that suits everybody's different business. The International platform support one line of business only, support hotels in the case of Booking.com and Agoda, and rental cars in the case of the guys at TravelJigsaw. I think the network team that supports all of those businesses does a good job of getting economies of scale where appropriate. And I also think we have a very good technologist who have been brought up in an entrepreneurial environment and in companies where we're just very, very careful about what we spend. So I think those are all the factors. I don't think we're under-invested. And as you can see by the growth that the business has produced over the last three or four years, we've been able to manage that growth without very significantly ramping our IT spend."

We're very pleased with the repeat trends that we see, and you can rest assured that it's a primary focus of the business. There are a lot of different ways that repeat customers can find our brands, and so we have to be attentive to those channels. But I think we have continued to basically build a very strong base of very loyal customers coming back to our websites. And Dan has mentioned in the past, it's one of the reasons that our overall advertising efficiencies have held up so well is because we're getting a lot of customers coming back to the website: loyal, repeat customers.

It's a massive market: 900 million people, not including China or India. There is, in many cases, high single-digit, double-digit economic growth going on there. The market for travel to Asia, I think, is growing very dramatically if you look at where the hotels are building their hotels. And because of the Internet and because of the increasing International airlift to the region, it's just a very, very robust travel market. So companies have been investing very significantly there for many years, and a lot of those businesses are showing excellent results. Ctrip is doing extremely well in particular for travel, Chinese travelers inside China.

And we're very excited about the products that we have out in the mobile markets, and we're very excited to continue to innovate and bring more functionality into the mobile application world and to equally importantly, improve the browsing experience for people that just come to our mobile website. I think a couple of the things that have happened in the marketplace that will probably be interesting, the first is that if you look at the fourth quarter results for the device manufacturers, it's clear that there is a very, very significant increase in sales in mobile devices in the quarter. A lot of that is holiday gifts and so forth. But there just continues to be a very significant increase in the number of devices that are out and activated. And I think that, that's going to be impacted positively by the availability of the iPhone on the Verizon platform, which will create a whole another category of demand. And you're also having non-Apple manufacturers building tablet devices that are getting good reviews, and the Android device has basically, in a very short period of time, grown to be of roughly equal size. So just the significant growth in the number of devices online represents an opportunity for folks like us and for guys that can get good functionality out into the marketplace to participate. With respect to emerging markets, I think that our view is that the mobile platforms will be very, very important, and that it may take a little bit longer for the mobile platforms in those markets to become significant vehicles for commerce. But that over the intermediate time frame, they have the potential to become more important as a share of total e-commerce just because a higher percentage of consumers in emerging markets are likely to have their primary interaction with the Internet over a mobile device versus a fixed desktop computer at their home or in the office. So I think that the potential there, it may take longer to realize, but it actually could potentially be higher than the domestic market share potential."

So with respect to the rental car spartan brands, as you call them, there's no question that consolidation in the industry has happened in a real way and that part of the strategy of the major rental car companies is to have a low cost brand associated with a premium brand. I think that over time, that can have an impact on how the large rental car companies allocate inventory to opaque. But I think the more important driver of whether opaque channels have strong inventory is overall fleet capacity, and that's been volatile. And that volatility has been evident in our results, and we expect that volatility to continue. With respect to TravelJigsaw, the growth rates that we're reporting for rental car are driven more by the fact that TravelJigsaw is being included in these quarters for the first time, and there's no year-over-year comp. We're very pleased with the growth we've seen in that business, but we haven't broken it out specifically. And it is not our intention to break it out in the future, but rather to discuss the rental car product broadly speaking internationally and domestically, and that's what you'll see us doing going forward. With respect to Hotwire in Europe, the European market is challenging for opaque hotels because in the United States and especially in large cities, well more than half of the inventory is national brands where star ratings and what you'd expect to see in a hotel are very, very well understood. And in Europe, it's a little bit harder because the hotels are all very different, and it's hard for the consumer to really know what they're getting without actually knowing more details about the hotel. I think that's going to be a challenge for Hotwire, and it's certainly a challenge for us as we try to sell opaque hotels to U.S. customers traveling to Europe. It's something we'll keep our eye on. It probably would have been a stronger supplier proposition two years ago than it is today."

Or do you believe that their efforts to make their platform more efficient and more effective and conversions as bearing fruit? The second question is two parts. With the stock price up so much, some people have their compensation go up materially over the last two years or so. And then with the organization getting so much larger, I fear that there maybe some creeping bureaucracy because that's just a natural thing that happens to organizations.

So I just can't comment specifically on what they might or might have done to change that relationship. With respect to compensation, we've worked very hard to create an environment around the world where the entrepreneurs who founded the businesses that we joined up with have the independence and the scope to continue building their business and have the financial incentive that they'll benefit significantly if the business does well. And that, in fact, has happened. And we're very pleased to see those incentives working to drive value for our shareholders, and it's one of the things that we worked hardest at, and senior management is making sure that, that independence in ownership is enjoyed by the local management teams, but that also everybody understands how all the businesses fit together and see the benefits of working together as a group, which we're down to the benefit of our shareholders over the last four or five years. With respect to bureaucracy, that's just not part of our DNA. We have very little by way of layers of management, and if someone were to criticize the organizational structure of our company, it would be to say that we don't have enough middle management and staff running around the place.

So with respect to businesses that have a lot of customers and can drive well-priced leads to online travel agents and people who make reservations, they'll have content as long as they are able to supply reasonably priced leads to the folks who are giving them the content. With respect to somebody who wants to go out to a hotel and build a booking business where the merchant or agency for a commission, I think the hill is a lot higher to climb because essentially, they are, by definition, showing up without any customers and saying, do the work to connect with me and I promise someday I'll bring you a lot of customers.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review, and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $4.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $137 million or $2.66 per share, up 57% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $2.46 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $31.2 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year. Growth rates for our International business increased during the quarter with 78% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs and from growth at Agoda and the Asian and South American business of Booking.com, which were seasonally strong in Q4 and Q1. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results.
Booking.com continued to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with over 135,000 hotels in 101 countries. Booking.com continues to build inventory in sales in Asia, South America and North America, delivering growth in reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world.
As those businesses have achieved greater scale, they are contributing to high reported consolidated growth rates. Bookings execution and expanding geographically and building share of online hotel demand has been, in my opinion, exceptional, as underscored by high International growth rates this quarter. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 14% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail and opaque hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs and the return to growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares.
Solid growth in opaque airline tickets helped the domestic top and bottom line as airplanes use the opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares generally. Ticket sales also benefited as American Airlines tickets were unavailable on Expedia and Orbitz for the quarter, but were available on Priceline.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 50% continues to reflect growth in the domestic retail and opaque hotel business, but even more so growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in Rental Car per unit sales in the quarter and is building availability as it approaches the high summer season.
In summary, the growth in the Group's International hotel business exceeded our forecast in the first quarter and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in Asia-Pacific and other new markets. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel",1997,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.
Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the first quarter as compared to 51% in the fourth quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs were up by about 4% for our International hotel service and by about 7% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year first quarter. FX rates for the first quarter were slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and for the prior year first quarter FX rates.
The strong performance in unit growth and increasing ADRs has caused total gross looking dollars to grow by 57% for Q1 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 79% and by 78% on the local-currency basis for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range, as our International hotel business delivered outstanding results that exceeded our expectations. We sustained outstanding performance for our International hotel business is a tribute to the hard work and operational excellence of our teams at Booking.com and Agoda. We saw a strong growth rates in our key markets in Q1. Our newer, faster growing markets in Asia-Pacific in South America, which experienced peak seasonal travel in the first and fourth quarters of the year, also contributed to our growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed 96 million in gross bookings in Q1. Rental Car days booked were up by 65% versus first quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 14% exceeded the top end of our guidance range and also exceeded the 9% growth rate posted in Q4. Strong growth in hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Airline tickets booked were up by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. The 12% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth.
The strong performance in gross bookings helped to drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $506 million and grew 59% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $388 million and grew by 81% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $118 million, which represented 13% growth versus prior year. Total operating expenses came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which resulted from gross bookings overperformance.
Online advertising expenses as a percentage of growth profit was slightly favorable to our guidance, but came in higher than the first quarter of 2010. As I mentioned, in February, when we gave guidance for the quarter, each year in the first quarter, we have significant ad spend related to bookings for travel that takes place in subsequent quarters when the related gross profit is recognized. Moreover, our International business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew faster than our U.S. business. Consequently, we've seen ad spending seen as a percentage of gross profit in Q1 even though we saw a strong ad efficiency for our brands.
Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter due to hiring of the slower paced than assumed lower than forecasted bonus expense. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $8 million, which is higher than the $5.5 million as expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates Mainly to more FX hedging and transaction losses that assume for guidance and as the euro strength after we gave guidance. The strengthening euro had a favorable impact on the translation of our Booking.com results into U.S. dollars.
I'd like to take a moment to remind you our hedging program is going. We enter into hedged contracts during the early part of each quarter to hedge against impact of foreign currency exchange rate volatility on the guidance that we give for non-GAAP EBITDA and net income. The hedges are our short-term in nature and do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. This year, the euro strengthened during the quarter after we entered our hedge contracts and we recorded hedge losses as a result. Last year, the euro weakened during the first quarter after we entered our hedge contracts, and we, therefore, recorded gains on the contracts.
In the first quarter of 2010, we had non-GAAP other income of $1.4 million compared to the $8 million of expense in Q1 of this year. This year-over-year swing in other expense resulted in EBITDA deleverage. Non-GAAP EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $173 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $147 million to $157 million and represents 55% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or non-GAAP EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, declined by 70 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q1.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $276 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2011, which represents a 164% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter.
We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter and paid about $62.6 million in the quarter, representing year in amount base to on the performance of our Agoda businesses since we acquired in 2007. We repurchased approximately $157 million of our common stock during the quarter.
As of March 31, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.2 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for second quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business, as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. I'll highlight that we bought TravelJigsaw in May 2010, and therefore, in Q2 2011, it is now starting to appear in our prior year comparable results from the date of acquisition.
Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.40 per euro and $1.65 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. At these exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been in the prior year average exchange rates. Specifically, average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 would be stronger by 16% for the euro and by 10% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, our hedge contracts took in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuation the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. These hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 53% to 58%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 76% to 81% as compared to last year and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 53% to 58%.
Our second quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for ADRs will be less than the increase we experienced in Q1, with both our International and U.S. hotel services. We expect the Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 36% to 41%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 57% to 62%.
For Q2 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $233 million to $243 million, with about $10 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising. Online advertising expenses as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with the prior year Q2. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand.
Our International brands are growing substantially in Q2 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our U.S. business. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $36 million and $41 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $75 million and $80 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $26 million to $31 million. We expect information technology costs of about $8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $9 million for Q2 2011 compared to income of about $2 million in Q2 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses, net interest expense and the charge for net income allocated to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP other income expense excludes noncash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt and includes the additional impact of other non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $320 million which I at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experienced EBITDA deleverage close principally by the $11 million negative year-over-year variance in other income and expense.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.70 to $4.90 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 56% growth over prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 20%, comprised of International income taxes and the alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S., where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods, even more significant growth in International earnings as compared to U.S. earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Wednesday's closing stock price of $537.56. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.03 to $4.23 per share for Q2.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses, and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to both the margin types, judgments, rulings or settlements. We are very pleased with the top line performance of the business delivered in Q1 and inherent in the guidance for Q2. However, as we have emphasized on previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in the quarter to a year-on-year unit growth rate in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we reported against prior year periods, which have improved economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs.
Our Q2 guidance reflects deceleration in the unit growth rate per hotel room night reservations based upon actual results to date and assumes deceleration as we proceed throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

Again, I think that if you look at -- there is lot of -- in every quarter, there are a lot of things that are outside the business that affect our growth rates. And so if you try to look at sequential growth rates from quarter-to-quarter, I think it's very easy to get a mistake and impression about what the long-term trend is. And if you look at hotel room night growth, local currency growth over the last 3, 4, 5 quarters, it's been occurring within a reasonably tight range. And as I said previously, I think that the first quarter growth rate is a little bit off trend and that it's a much better way to look at it, to look at it over a longer period of time. One thing that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is, that we do have a bigger business in Asia and in South America where the seasonality is a little bit different. And those businesses have grown at higher rates than the rest of our businesses and so the first quarter growth rate could be benefiting from the positive results in those markets and from the different seasonality where they just have a stronger results in the fourth and first quarter, whereas our North American, Western European and U.S. business, the strongest seasonality is in the second and third quarters."

Dan will give a detailed financial review, and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $4.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $137 million or $2.66 per share, up 57% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $2.46 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $31.2 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year. 
Growth rates for our International business increased during the quarter with 78% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs and from growth at Agoda and the Asian and South American business of Booking.com, which were seasonally strong in Q4 and Q1. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results.
Booking.com continued to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with over 135,000 hotels in 101 countries. Booking.com continues to build inventory in sales in Asia, South America and North America, delivering growth in reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world.
As those businesses have achieved greater scale, they are contributing to high reported consolidated growth rates. Bookings execution and expanding geographically and building share of online hotel demand has been, in my opinion, exceptional, as underscored by high International growth rates this quarter. 
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 14% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail and Opaque hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs and the return to growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares.
Solid growth in Opaque airline tickets helped the domestic top and bottom line as airlines use the Opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares generally. Ticket sales also benefited as American Airlines tickets were unavailable on Expedia and Orbitz for the quarter, but were available on Priceline.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 50% continues to reflect growth in the domestic retail and Opaque hotel business, but even more so growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in Rental Car unit sales in the quarter and is building availability as it approaches the high summer season.
In summary, the growth in the Group's International hotel business exceeded our forecast in the first quarter and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in Asia-Pacific and other new markets. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,130664793,123200,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel",2000,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.
Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the first quarter as compared to 51% in the fourth quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs were up by about 4% for our International hotel service and by about 7% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year of first quarter. FX rates for the first quarter were slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and for the prior year first quarter FX rates.
The strong performance in unit growth and increasing ADRs has caused total gross booking dollars to grow by 57% for Q1 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 79% and by 78% on a local-currency basis for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range, as our International hotel business delivered outstanding results that exceeded our expectations. 
The sustained outstanding performance for our International hotel business is a tribute to the hard work and operational excellence of our teams at Booking.com and Agoda. We saw a strong growth rates in our key markets in Q1. Our newer, faster growing markets in Asia-Pacific and South America, which experienced peak seasonal travel in the first and fourth quarters of the year, also contributed to our growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed $96 million in gross bookings in Q1. RentalCars days booked were up by 65% versus first quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 14% exceeded the top end of our guidance range and also exceeded the 9% growth rate posted in Q4. Strong growth in hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Airline tickets booked were up by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. The 12% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth.
The strong performance in gross bookings helped to drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $506 million and grew 59% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $388 million and grew by 81% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $118 million, which represented 13% growth versus prior year. 
Total operating expenses came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which resulted from gross bookings overall performance.
Online advertising expenses, as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance, but came in higher than the first quarter of 2010. As I mentioned, in February, when we gave guidance for the quarter, each year in the first quarter, we have significant ad spend related to bookings for travel that takes place in subsequent quarters when the related gross profit is recognized. Moreover, our International business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew faster than our U.S. business. Consequently, we've seen ad spending increase as the percentage of gross profit in Q1, even though we saw a strong ad efficiency for our brands.
Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter due to hiring of the slower paced than assumed and lower than forecasted bonus expense. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $8 million, which is higher than the $5.5 million as expense we assumed in our guidance. 
The variance relates mainly to more FX hedging and transaction losses than assume for guidance and as the euro strengthened after we gave guidance. The strengthening euro had a favorable impact on the translation of our Booking.com results into U.S. dollars.
I'd like to take a moment to remind you our hedging program works. We enter into hedged contracts during the early part of each quarter to hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate volatility on the guidance that we give for non-GAAP EBITDA and net income. The hedges are our short-term in nature and do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. 
This year, the euro strengthened during the quarter after we enter our hedge contracts and we recorded hedge losses as a result. Last year, the euro weakened during the first quarter after we entered our hedge contracts, and we, therefore, recorded gains on the contracts.
In the first quarter of 2010, we had non-GAAP other income of $1.4 million compared to the $8 million of expense in Q1 of this year. This year-over-year swing in other expense resulted in EBITDA deleverage. Non-GAAP EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $173 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $147 million to $157 million and represents 55% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or non-GAAP EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, declined by 70 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q1.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $276 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2011, which represents a 164% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter.
We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter and paid about $62.6 million in the quarter, representing the year on that amount to base the kind[ph] of performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. We repurchased approximately $157 million of our common stock during the quarter.
As of March 31, our cash investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.2 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for second quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflect exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business, as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. I'll highlight that we bought TravelJigsaw in May 2010, and therefore, in Q2 2011, it is now starting to appear in our prior year comparable results from the date of acquisition.
Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.48 per euro and $1.65 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. At earlier, these exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been at the prior year average exchange rates. Specifically, average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 would be stronger by 16% for the euro and by 10% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned earlier, our hedge contracts are in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuation in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 53% to 58%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 76% to 81% as compared to last year and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 53% to 58%.
Our second quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for ADRs will be less than the increase we experienced in Q1, with both our International and U.S. hotel services. We expect the Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 36% to 41%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 57% to 62%.
For Q2 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $233 million to $243 million, with about $10 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising. Online advertising expenses as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with the prior year Q2. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand.
Our International brands are growing substantially in Q2 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our U.S. business. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $36 million and $41 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $75 million and $80 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $26 million to $31 million. We expect information technology costs of about $8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $9 million for Q2 2011 compared to income of about $2 million in Q2 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses, net interest expense and the charge for net income allocated to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP, other income expense excludes noncash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt and includes the additional impact of other non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $320 million, which at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience EBITDA deleverage close principally by the $11 million negative year-over-year variance in other income and expense.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.70 to $4.90 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 56% growth over prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 20%, comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S., where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods, even more significant growth in International earnings as compared to U.S. earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Wednesday's closing stock price of $537.56. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.03 to $4.23 per share for Q2.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses, and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. 
We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements. We are very pleased with the top line performance of the business delivered in Q1 and inherent in the guidance for Q2. However, as we have emphasized on previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly, year-on-year unit growth rate in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods, which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs.
Our Q2 guidance reflects deceleration in the unit growth rate per hotel room night reservations based upon actual results to date and assume deceleration as we proceed throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

Part of that is at Booking.com, who's building out the International platform to accommodate the high growth rates they've experienced, but also, we have Agoda and TravelJigsaw that are at earlier stages of their development and also requiring investment. I would not take the position that we don't foresee the possibility of earnings leverage going forward. What you're seeing now, really, reflects our judgment in terms of how to manage the business to make sure we're investing to capture the opportunity, especially in these rapidly growing markets in Asia and elsewhere, where we're still relatively new entrant."

Again, I think that if you look at -- there is lot of -- in every quarter, there are a lot of things that are outside the business that affect our growth rate. And so if you'll try to look at sequential growth rates from quarter-to-quarter, I think it's very easy to get a mistake and impression about what the long-term trend is. And if you look at hotel room night growth, local currency growth over the last 3, 4, 5 quarters, it's been occurring within a reasonably tight range. And as I said previously, I think that the first quarter growth rate is a little bit off trend and that it's a much better way to look at it, to look at it over a longer period of time. One thing that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is, that we do have our bigger business in Asia and in South America where the seasonality is a little bit different. And those businesses have grown at higher rates than the rest of our businesses and so the first quarter growth rate could be benefiting from the positive results in those markets and from the different seasonality where they just have a stronger results in the fourth and first quarter, whereas our North American, Western European and U.S. business, the strongest seasonality is in the second and third quarters."

Booking.com has been building its hotel supply in the United States over the last couple of years primarily for European customers that are traveling inbound. But we felt it was a good opportunity to provide a little more diversity to the inventory, some more buying choices for priceline.com customers. That project has worked well. A couple of comments that I would make, first of all, Booking.com still has ways to go to have a full complement of hotels across all the markets in the United States. The team has done a great job of building inventory quickly, but it's a very, very large market and there are still are ways to go.

Dan will give a detailed financial review, and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $4.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $137 million or $2.66 per share, up 57% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $2.46 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $31.2 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year. 
Growth rates for our International business increased during the quarter with 78% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs and from growth at Agoda and the Asian and South American business of Booking.com, which were seasonally strong in Q4 and Q1. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply and inclusion of TravelJigsaw results.
Booking.com continued to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with over 135,000 hotels in 101 countries. Booking.com continues to build inventory in sales in Asia, South America and North America, delivering growth in reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world.
As those businesses have achieved greater scale, they are contributing to high reported consolidated growth rates. Bookings execution and expanding geographically and building share of online hotel demand has been, in my opinion, exceptional, as underscored by high International growth rates this quarter. 
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 14% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail and Opaque hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs and the return to growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares.
Solid growth in Opaque airline tickets helped the domestic top and bottom line as airlines use the Opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares generally. Ticket sales also benefited as American Airlines tickets were unavailable on Expedia and Orbitz for the quarter, but were available on Priceline.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 50% continues to reflect growth in the domestic retail and Opaque hotel business, but even more so growing contributions from Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall International and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in Rental Car unit sales in the quarter and is building availability as it approaches the high summer season.
In summary, the growth in the Group's International hotel business exceeded our forecast in the first quarter and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in Asia-Pacific and other new markets. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,130664793,123272,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel",1999,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2011.
Q1 top line performance was exceptional, reflecting acceleration in unit growth rates. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the first quarter as compared to 51% in the fourth quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs were up by about 4% for our International hotel service and by about 7% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year of first quarter. FX rates for the first quarter were slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and for the prior year first quarter FX rates.
The strong performance in unit growth and increasing ADRs has caused total gross booking dollars to grow by 57% for Q1 compared to the prior year. Our International gross bookings grew by 79% and by 78% on a local-currency basis for Q1 2011 compared to the prior year. These growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range, as our International hotel business delivered outstanding results that exceeded our expectations. 
The sustained outstanding performance for our International hotel business is a tribute to the hard work and operational excellence of our teams at Booking.com and Agoda. We saw a strong growth rates in our key markets in Q1. Our newer, faster growing markets in Asia-Pacific and South America, which experienced peak seasonal travel in the first and fourth quarters of the year, also contributed to our growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed $96 million in gross bookings in Q1. RentalCars days booked were up by 65% versus first quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 14% exceeded the top end of our guidance range and also exceeded the 9% growth rate posted in Q4. Strong growth in hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Airline tickets booked were up by 2% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. The 12% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth.
The strong performance in gross bookings helped to drive bottom line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $506 million and grew 59% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $388 million and grew by 81% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $118 million, which represented 13% growth versus prior year. 
Total operating expenses came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which resulted from gross bookings over-performance.
Online advertising expenses, as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance, but came in higher than the first quarter of 2010. As I mentioned, in February, when we gave guidance for the quarter, each year in the first quarter, we have significant ad spend related to bookings for travel that takes place in subsequent quarters when the related gross profit is recognized. Moreover, our International business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew faster than our U.S. business. Consequently, we've seen ad spend increase as the percentage of gross profit in Q1, even though we saw a strong ad efficiency for our brands.
Personnel expense was lower than forecast for the quarter due to hiring of the slower paced than assumed and lower than forecasted bonus expense. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $8 million, which is higher than the $5.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. 
The variance relates mainly to more FX hedging and transaction losses than assume for guidance as the euro strengthened after we gave guidance. The strengthening euro had a favorable impact on the translation of our Booking.com results into U.S. dollars.
I'd like to take a moment to remind you how our hedging program works. We enter into hedged contracts during the early part of each quarter to hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate volatility on the guidance that we give for non-GAAP EBITDA and net income. The hedges are short-term in nature and do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. 
This year, the euro strengthened during the quarter after we enter our hedge contracts and we recorded hedge losses as a result. Last year, the euro weakened during the first quarter after we entered our hedge contracts, and we, therefore, recorded gains on the contracts.
In the first quarter of 2010, we had non-GAAP other income of $1.4 million compared to the $8 million of expense in Q1 of this year. This year-over-year swing in other expense resulted in EBITDA deleverage. Non-GAAP EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $173 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $147 million to $157 million and represents 55% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or non-GAAP EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, declined by 70 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q1.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $276 million of cash from operations during first quarter of 2011, which represents a 164% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter.
We spent about $8 million on CapEx in the quarter and paid about $62.6 million in the quarter, representing the year on that amount to be base upon the performance of our Agoda business since we acquired it in 2007. We repurchased approximately $157 million of our common stock during the quarter.
As of March 31, our cash and investments of $1.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.2 billion. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.
Now for second quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by the continued strength of our worldwide hotel room reservation business, as well as the inclusion of TravelJigsaw. I'll highlight that we bought TravelJigsaw in May 2010, and therefore, in Q2 2011, it is now starting to appear in our prior year comparable results from the date of acquisition.
Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.48 per euro and $1.65 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. At earlier, these exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been at the prior year average exchange rates. Specifically, average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 would be stronger by 16% for the euro and by 10% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned earlier, our hedge contracts are in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuation in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 53% to 58%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 76% to 81% as compared to last year and to grow on a local-currency basis by approximately 53% to 58%.
Our second quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for ADRs will be less than the increase we experienced in Q1, for both our International and U.S. hotel services. We expect the Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 36% to 41%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 57% to 62%.
For Q2 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $233 million to $243 million, with about $10 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is assumed to increase compared with the prior year Q2. The increase is driven principally by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our online advertising by brand.
Our International brands are growing substantially in Q2 and spend the higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our U.S. business. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $36 million and $41 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $75 million and $80 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $26 million to $31 million. We expect information technology costs of about $8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $9 million for Q2 2011 compared to income of about $2 million in Q2 2010. The other income expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses, net interest expense and the charge for net income allocated to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP, other income expense excludes noncash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt and includes the additional impact of other non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $320 million, which at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will experience EBITDA deleverage close principally by the $11 million negative year-over-year variance in other income and expense.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.70 to $4.90 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 56% growth over prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 20%, comprised of International income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S., where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability.
Our non-GAAP tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods, due to more significant growth in International earnings as compared to U.S. earnings. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Wednesday's closing stock price of $537.56. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.03 to $4.23 per share for Q2.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses, and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. 
We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements. We are very pleased with the top line performance of the business delivered in Q1 and inherent in the guidance for Q2. However, as we have emphasized on previous earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly, year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods, which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs.
Our Q2 guidance reflects deceleration in the unit growth rate per hotel room night reservations based upon actual results to date and assume deceleration as we proceed throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macro economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

So I wouldn't want anybody to think that somehow we're walking away from that general premise. Again, I think that if you look at -- there is lot of -- in every quarter, there are a lot of things that are outside the business that affect our growth rate. And so if you'll try to look at sequential growth rates from quarter-to-quarter, I think it's very easy to get a mistake and impression about what the long-term trend is. And if you look at hotel room night growth, local currency growth over the last 3, 4, 5 quarters, it's been occurring within a reasonably tight range. And as I said previously, I think that the first quarter growth rate is a little bit off trend and that it's a much better way to look at it, to look at it over a longer period of time. One thing that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is, that we do have our bigger business in Asia and in South America where the seasonality is a little bit different. And those businesses have grown at higher rates than the rest of our businesses and so the first quarter growth rate could be benefiting from the positive results in those markets and from the different seasonality where they just have a stronger results in the fourth and first quarter, whereas our North American, Western European and U.S. business, the strongest seasonality is in the second and third quarters."

We've heard Expedia say some positive things about eLong and that eLong is now mostly focused on the hotel opportunity. From what we read in Expedia's announcement, it looks to us that their primary emphasis in the hotel space in Asia is going to be hotels.com because the Expedia brand and a lot of those markets is now going to be operated through a joint venture with a low-cost airline. So there's a lot of companies in the space, but there is also rapidly growing market and a lot of running room there. And we are focused on all of it.

So the Pay As You Stay for everybody on the phone is typically the Booking.com inventory that has been integrated and is now offered via the Priceline website. Booking.com has been building its hotel supply in the United States over the last couple of years primarily for European customers that are traveling inbound. But we felt it was a good opportunity to provide a little more diversity to the inventory, some more buying choices for priceline.com customers. That project has worked well. A couple of comments that I would make, first of all, Booking.com still has a ways to go to have a full complement of hotels across all the markets in the United States. The team has done a great job of building inventory quickly, but it's a very, very large market and there's still a ways to go. So I think there still is more opportunity and potential to the project. I'm not going to break out what the percentage is. All I will say is, that the program is successful. It's driving a number of reservations that's significant to the U.S. business.

I will make some opening remarks market and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions. 
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $5.8 billion, up 70% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $283 million or $5.49 per share, up 78% versus prior year. Second quarter surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.91 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room nights reservations were $36.1 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our International business held firm during the quarter, with 79% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs, impressive growth in new markets in Booking.com and high excellent growth rates for Agoda and TravelJigsaw. International Hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in our hotel supply with hotels now in over 110 countries worldwide. Booking.com group at supply platform of 125,000 hotels at the fastest pace in over three years.
Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales around the world, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world. Bookings has also continued to execute well and it's high season, not only expanding geographically but also in securing availability in high-demand destinations helping achieve high international growth rates this quarter. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 13% in the second quarter, due primarily to growth in retail, hotel room nights gross aided by improved ADRs, and continued growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares. Growth in Opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line as the airlines used the Opaque channel as a revenue market to a while they increased fares.
Urchin gross at this growth of 45% continues to reflect growth in the domestic margin businesses, both primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant have bookings. Agoda reported higher year-over-year growth rates in gross bookings as it comped last year in Thailand, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered better than anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in building toward the higher season.
In summary, the growth in the Group's International Hotel business exceeded our forecast in the second quarter and we are pleased with the progress of our brand's expansion in new markets and their hard work in preparing for high-season travel.

33254,138198199,152654,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%.",2375,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the second quarter maintaining the same strong level of growth that was generated in the first quarter. Average daily rates or ADRs were up on a local currency basis by approximately 4% for our International Hotel service and by almost 8% for our U.S. hotels service for Q2 2011 compared to the prior year's second quarter.
These increases were favorable to our assumptions for Q2 guidance. FX rates for the second quarter were unfavorable from the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, currency exchange rates provided a substantial tailwind when compared to the prior year second quarter FX rates. The average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling grew approximately 14% and 9% higher respectively than the average exchange rates for Q2 2010. Our international gross bookings grew by 98% and by 79% on a local currency basis for Q2 2011 compared to the prior year. Our Booking.com and Agoda businesses once again delivered outstanding results it exceeded our expectations when we gave guidance in the quarter back on May 4. Our forecast is based upon the growth rates we saw through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would further decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to see acceleration in our unit growth rates over the more seasonally significant back half of the quarter.
The outstanding unit growth, as well as an ADR favorability guidance, drove results that exceeded top end of our guidance range. Performance across key markets was good. We saw a continued strong growth rates in our core European market in Q2. Fastest growing markets were International business, including Asia Pacific, North America and South America, continue to grow at above at levels that exceeded our exit consolidated unit growth rate. These markets are increasing as a percentage of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective, and are therefore having a more pronounced impact on our overall growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K. based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in late 2010, contributed $154 million in gross bookings in Q2 as compared to $44 million included in Q2 2010 from the point we acquired the business on May 18, 2010. RentalCars days booked for the group were up by 55% versus second quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw.
Since we have now lapsed the May 2010 acquisition, we will not separately report gross bookings for TravelJigsaw in future quarters. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 13% is at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights and higher ADRs were key drivers. Railroad ties hotel room growth decelerated likely as a result of competitors' initiatives in the hotel arena.
Airline tickets booked were up by 7% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. A 4% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. Opaque Rental Car performed well do to improve access to discounted rates compared to the first quarter. The strong performance in gross bookings helped drive bottom-line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and the First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $749 million and grew 68% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $612 million, an increase of 90% as compared to the prior year or 71% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $237 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which is consistent with our gross bookings over performance. Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, was slightly favorable to our guidance as a result of better-than-assumed ad efficiency. What came in higher in the second quarter of 2010. The variance versus prior year is caused by the significant level of growth for our International business which relies more and online advertising spend than our U.S. business. Consequently, online ad spend increased as a percentage of gross profit in Q2, even though we were pleased with the underlying advertising efficiencies for our brands.
We will discuss operating leverage this quarter and in the future based upon non-GAAP operating income, rather than adjusted EBITA as a percentage of gross profit. We believe this is a more accurate leverage metric because FX gains and losses from our short-term earnings hedges should address EBITDA and not gross profit, and therefore, changes in exchange rates create anomalous leverage comparisons from period to period. Our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation in our earnings release provides detail in the calculation of non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income expense as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.2% for Q2 2011, which represents an increase in leverage of 210 basis points versus prior year Q2.
Although we had some good leverage in online advertising which I just discussed, our other operating expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit, resulting in improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $9 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging and transaction losses than assumed of our guidance as the euro weakened after we did guidance. Our cash income tax rate was favorable to last year and our guidance forecast. During second quarter, we increased our estimate of the impact of the Innovation Box tax benefit on our annual effective tax rate. We now expect the Innovation Box benefit to reduce our 2011 income tax rate by 2 to 4 percentage points. The additional benefit is reflected in our second quarter tax expense as well as the benefit of about $2 million reflecting the cumulative cash up impact on our change in the first quarter tax revision. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $349 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $320 million, and represents 71% growth versus prior year. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $223 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2011, which represents a 19% increase versus prior year.
During our last Earnings Call, I highlighted that operating cash flow was impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter. This timing difference had a favorable impact on operating cash flow for the first quarter and an offsetting unfavorable impact for the second quarter. Operating cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was 71% higher than the prior year comparable period. We spent about $10 million on CapEx in the quarter, compared to $13 million in the quarter to purchase the noncontrolling interest in TravelJigsaw.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $1.9 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.4 billion. We also have a $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and expires in September 2012. 
Now for third quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by our Worldwide Hotel Reservation business.
Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain the same at $1.42 per euro and $1.64 per British pound as of yesterday's closing rates. As of this exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been at the prior year average exchange rates.
Specifically, average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 would be stronger by about 11% for the euro and by about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. However, as we emphasized in the past and want to remind you again, volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which seems to be the rule rather than the exception the recent past, can materially impact our US-denominated earnings. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter ebitda and net earnings from any fluctuation in euro or pound versus the dollar, between now and the end of the quarter but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation in our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit, and do not adjourn beyond the third quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 47% to 52% with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 62% to 67% as compared to last year and grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. The midpoint of this range represents a significant sequential decrease from Q2 results. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease are softer a Q2 comp form year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp. There were a local international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1100 basis points sequentially.
Also, for the first time, the prior year Q3 includes TravelJigsaw for the full period. Finally, our guidance assume that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q3 will be less than that experienced in Q2 for both our international and U.S. hotel services. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 37% to 42% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 54% to 59%. 
I'll now give guidance for Q3 operating expenses on the line by line basis.
Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide topline and bottom-line guidance but we plan to seize our practice of providing line by line guidance for each operating expense line item. We are targeting Q3 consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $273 million and $283 million, with about $8 million of that amount being spent through off-line advertising. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $40 million and the $45 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation to come in between $78 million and $83 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $27 million and $32 million. We expect information technology comps of about $10 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization of about $6 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to an expense of approximately $6 million for Q3 2011 compared to expense of about $12 million in Q3 2010. Other expenses for Q3 2010 because it includes about $6 million related to FX hedging losses as the euro strengthened during the quarter after we entered our hedge contracts. Other income and expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses and transaction costs, net interest expense and the charge for net income located to noncontrolling interest.
Non-GAAP and other income expense excludes the non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash set to convertible debt. And includes additional impact of non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $595 million and $615 million, which at the midpoint represent 67% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will extend operating leverage by approximately 270 basis point as our gross profit grows at a faster pace than our operating expenses.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9.10 to $9.30 per share, which at the midpoint represents 73% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes a net [indiscernible] cash income tax rate of approximately 20% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our cash income tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to U.S. earnings where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. This cash tax rate reflects an assumed 2 to 4 percentage point benefit from the Innovation Box tax in the Netherlands. The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in 2012 as we complete the phase-in period.
In 2012, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by approximately 4 to 6 percentage points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based on yesterday's closing stock price of $521.97. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $8.37 to $8.57 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses, the beneficial impact in Q2 of reversing the 2010 reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings.
We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
We are pleased with the topline performance of the business in Q2 and inherent in the guidance for Q3. As we had emphasized in prior earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly, year-on-year unit growth rate in the future to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps since we report it gets prior year periods, which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs. Thus far, quarter-to-date, we assume deceleration year-over-year in unit growth today compared to the second quarter of 2011, our guidance reflects actual deceleration and assumes that the deceleration will continue through the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Justin, in terms of saturation levels, we consistently said that it's our expectation that the growth rates in our core markets, which tend to be more mature, more competitive, would slow down and our strategy has been to build the business in new markets to a size where the higher growth rates in those new markets can have a meaningful impact on the total business. And that, in fact, is what's happening. The new markets are growing faster than the well-established core markets, and our assumption in guiding to decelerating growth rate is that trend would be reflected in the future. In terms of addition of hotels, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had significant growth in hotel counts. Again, with 155,000 hotels, I think you should expect for those growth rates over the long-term to slow down, rather than to accelerate, although there's still a lot of hotels particularly in the new markets that we need to sign up for the International businesses. With respect to what we learned in the '08 slow down, I think what we learned principally is really not much we can do about changes in currency exchange rates and changes in ADRs, which is what hurt our dollar-denominated reported results the most during the financial crisis. The other lesson that we learned though is I think we did the right thing in continuing to invest aggressively in building out International Hotel platform, and to invest aggressively in marketing and I think those investments are still paying dividends for us today."

And so, American consumers have always been very active shoppers for airline tickets. They typically are going through a lot of different sites. And so, I think, because we're one of the main brands, we benefit from that shopping activity to a degree and traffic although sometimes it hurts our conversion. The other thing that I would mention though is I think our air team at priceline.com has done a very nice job of continuing to build their position and relevance to the Opaque product so that when airfares are going up like they have, the airlines, I think, are using the product as a tool to revenue manage and keep their loads up as prices are going up, and that's worked well I think for the airlines but it's also worked well for our Opaque business."

I was wondering if you're seeing incremental demand or is that just sort of early stages of growth in this business? And then second, I was curious on how important you think owning inventory in the Asian market is or partnering up with how Expedia partnered with Air Asia to secure kind of nair inventory or Ctrip taking ownership in a hotel to get access to a hotel inventory and make my trip kind of also going into that Asia space as well. So I'm just kind of curious on how you look at the competitive landscape and whether or not inventory -- how important it is to partner up with for inventory."

We have not traditionally taken principal position with inventory. That's something that consolidators did in the past, and that basically took away the hotels control over their pricing, usually involved much higher margins that we charge and we believe our business model is much more both hotel-friendly and even more important, consumer-friendly. And so, our efforts are really focused more on making sure that we've got availability realtime through our extranet rather than trying to sell off inventory. The Air Asia transaction is really a very different situation. We don't sell airline tickets in Asia. We only sell hotel reservations, and a little bit of rental car. And I don't think that you need to engage in that kind of partnership and trade off some of your equity and your business in order to get hotel inventory. The distribution model is attractive enough to hotels that they're happy to participate in it without that kind of an arrangement being a prerequisite. With respect to Ctrip and hotel business in China, I think that's a unique market where it was very important for the whole market to increase the inventory of moderately priced-hotels in China, in order to be help the entire travel industry growth for travelers inside of China. Right now, that's a smaller part of our business. We're focused much more on international travel to and from China, and therefore, that has not been an important part, at least for our strategy in that market."

I don't have any particular comment to make about whether that has an impact on what we're seeing in the U.K. I think that part of that is driven by share shifts to low cost carriers, and that sort of things. So it's hard to correlate that to exactly what's happening in the online marketplace, and if you look at our competition,, Expedia, I think posted attractive growth numbers. U.K. is a big market for them so I don't think that you can drill any firm conclusions by what's going on in those other businesses. With respect to U.S. Rental Car business, our commentary on that is really more driven by the extent to which, rental car companies are operating with very constrained fleets or with relatively unconstrained fleets. And in summer period, the fleets are very constrained. You know better than I do, a lot of reasons why that happens. And I think this year, we are experiencing, has been so far, that there was decent fleet availability to allow participation in some of the promotional channels and revenue-management type channels like our Opaque, and as a result, we're pretty pleased with the numbers we were seeing there. The pricing in the rental car market seems to go, sometimes in a very different direction from pricing in the other travel verticals. So at a time when hotel ADRs and airfares were coming down a couple years ago, rental car prices were going up, now prices for airline tickets and hotels have been very firm really for a number of quarters, rental car prices a little bit  softer. I really don't have much beyond that."

It's a very interesting category. It's very well-suited to the Internet because of the fragmentation of supply, and because of the critical need the consumer has to to learn about the place they're going to stay. The internet is just an excellent vehicle for delivering that information and the development of social applications is a key ingredient there, and I think because consumers are so interested in participating in those applications, it's really got an ability to boost the business like Air DND, and perhaps drive what I think they believe is really incremental business. It's not people that otherwise would would've stayed in a hotel. You know the story that they tell about the starting of the business was a time when there were no rooms Hotel available in San Francisco, and they were able to essentially run out there air mattresses because there was no place for people to stay.

Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $5.8 billion, up 70% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $283 million, or $5.49 per share, up 78% versus prior year. Second quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.91 per share and in our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $36.1 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our international business held firm during the quarter with 79% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs, impressive growth in new markets for Booking.com and high excellent growth rates for Agoda and TravelJigsaw. 
International hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply, with hotels now in over 110 countries worldwide. Booking.com grew its supply platform of 155,000 hotels at the fastest pace in over 3 years.
Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales around the world, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world. Bookings has also continued to execute well into its high season, not only expanding geographically but also in securing availability in high-demand destinations, helping achieve high international growth rates this quarter. 
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 13% in the second quarter, due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by improved ADRs and continued growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares. Growth in opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line as airlines used the opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 45% continues to reflect growth in the domestic merchant businesses. That was primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant bookings. Agoda reported higher year-over-year growth rates in gross bookings as it comped last year's civil strife in Thailand, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered better than anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in building toward the high season.
In summary, the growth in the group's international hotel business exceeded our forecast in the second quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brand's expansion in new markets and their hard work in preparing for high-season travel. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,138198199,152829,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%.",2385,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the second quarter, maintaining the same strong level of growth that was generated in the first quarter. 
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 4% for our international hotel service and by almost 8% for our U.S. hotel service for Q2 2011 compared to the prior year second quarter. These increases were favorable to our assumptions for Q2 guidance. 
FX rates for the second quarter were unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, currency exchange rates provided a substantial tailwind when compared to the prior year second quarter FX rates. The average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling grew approximately 14% and 9% higher, respectively, than the average exchange rates for Q2 2010. 
Our international gross bookings grew by 98% and by 79% on a local currency basis for Q2 2011 compared to the prior year. Our Booking.com and Agoda businesses once again delivered outstanding results. It exceeded our expectations when we gave guidance for the quarter back on May 4. 
Our forecast was based upon the growth rates we saw through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would further decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to see acceleration in our unit growth rates over the more seasonally significant back half of the quarter.
The outstanding unit growth, as well as some ADR favorability versus guidance, drove results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Performance across key markets was good. We saw continued strong growth rates in our core European market in Q2. 
Faster-growing markets for our international business, including Asia Pacific, North America and South America, continue to grow at levels that exceeded our consolidated unit growth rate. These markets are increasing as a percentage of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective and are, therefore, having a more pronounced impact on our overall growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in late 2010, contributed $154 million in gross bookings in Q2 as compared to $44 million included in Q2 2010 from the point we acquired the business on May 18, 2010. Rental car days booked for the group were up by 55% versus second quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw.
Since we have now lapsed the May 2010 acquisition, we will not separately report gross bookings for TravelJigsaw in future quarters. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 13% is at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. 
Name Your Own Price hotel room night growth decelerated, likely as a result of competitors' initiatives in the opaque hotel arena.
Airline tickets booked were up by 7% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. A 4% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. Opaque rental car performed well due to improved access to discounted rates compared to the first quarter. The strong performance in gross bookings helped drive bottom-line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $749 million and grew 68% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $612 million, an increase of 90% as compared to the prior year or 71% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $137 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher-than-forecasted online advertising expense, which was consistent with our gross booking's over performance. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance as a result of better-than-assumed ad efficiency, but came in higher than the second quarter of 2010. 
The variance versus prior year is caused by the significant level of growth for our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend than our U.S. business. Consequently, online ad spend increased as a percentage of gross profit in Q2, even though we were pleased with the underlying advertising efficiency for our brands.
We will discuss operating leverage this quarter and in the future based upon non-GAAP operating income rather than adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit. We believe this is a more accurate leverage metric, because FX gains and losses from our short-term earnings hedges shield adjusted EBITDA and not gross profit. And therefore, changes in exchange rates create anomalous leverage comparisons from period to period. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation in our earnings release provides detail on the calculation of non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income expressed as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.2% for Q2 2011, which represents an increase in leverage of 210 basis points versus prior year Q2.
Although we had some due leverage in online advertising as I just discussed, our other operating expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit, resulting in improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $9 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging and transaction losses than assumed for guidance as the euro weakened after we gave guidance. 
Our cash income tax rate was favorable to prior year and our guidance forecast. During the second quarter, we increased our estimate of the impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit on our annual effective tax rate. We now expect the Innovation Box benefit to reduce our 2011 income tax rate by 2 to 4 percentage points. The additional benefit is reflected in our second quarter tax expense, as well as the benefit of about $2 million reflecting the cumulative cash up impact of the change on our first quarter tax provision. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $349 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $320 million, and represents 71% growth versus prior year. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $223 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2011, which represents a 19% increase versus prior year.
During our last earnings call, I highlighted that operating cash flow was impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter. This timing difference had a favorable impact on operating cash flow for the first quarter and an offsetting unfavorable impact for the second quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the 6 months ended June 30, 2011 is 71% higher than the prior year comparable period. We spent about $10 million on CapEx in the quarter and paid about $13 million in the quarter to purchase a portion of the noncontrolling interest in TravelJigsaw.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $1.9 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.4 billion. We also have a $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and expires in September 2012. 
Now for the third quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by our worldwide hotel reservation business.
Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.43 per euro and $1.64 per British pound of yesterday's closing rates. At or near these exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been at the prior year average exchange rates.
Specifically, average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 would be stronger by about 11% for the euro and by about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. However, as we have emphasized in the past and want to remind you again, volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which seems to be the rule rather than the exception in the recent past, can materially impact our U.S.-denominated earnings. 
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 47% to 52%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 62% to 67% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. 
The midpoint of this range represents a significant sequential decrease from Q2 results. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease are a softer Q2 comp a year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp. Our local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially. Also, for the first time, the prior year Q3 includes TravelJigsaw for the full period. 
Finally, our guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q3 will be less than that experienced in Q2 for both our international and U.S. hotel services. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 37% to 42% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 54% to 59%. 
I'll now give guidance for Q3 operating expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide top line and bottom line guidance, but we plan to cease our practice of providing line-by-line guidance for each operating expense line item. We are targeting Q3 consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $273 million and $283 million, with about $8 million of that amount being spent through offline advertising. 
We expect sales and marketing expense of between $40 million and $45 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $78 million and $83 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $27 million to $32 million. We expect information technology costs of about $10 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition and amortization of about $6 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $6 million for Q3 2011 compared to expense of about $12 million in Q3 2010. Other expense is higher for Q3 2010 because it includes about $6 million related to FX hedging losses as the euro strengthened during the quarter after we entered our hedge contracts. 
Other income and expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses and transaction costs, net interest expense and the charge for net income allocated to noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP other income expense excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled to convertible debt and includes the additional impact of other non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $595 million and $615 million, which at the midpoint represents 67% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will expand operating leverage by approximately 270 basis points as our gross profit grows at a faster pace than our operating expenses.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9.10 to $9.30 per share, which at the midpoint represents 73% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 20% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our cash income tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to U.S. earnings where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. 
This cash tax rate reflects an assumed 2 to 4 percentage point benefit from the Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in 2012 as we complete the phase-in period.
In 2012, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by approximately 4 to 6 percentage points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $521.97. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $8.37 to $8.57 per share for Q3. 
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses, the beneficial impact in Q2 of reversing the 2010 reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings.
We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
We are pleased with the top line performance of the business in Q2 and inherent in the guidance for Q3. As we have emphasized in prior earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly, year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps since we report against prior year periods, which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs. 
Thus far, quarter-to-date, we assume deceleration in year-over-year unit growth rates compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our guidance reflects this actual deceleration and assumes that the deceleration will continue through the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Justin, in terms of saturation levels, we consistently said that it's our expectation that the growth rates in our core markets, which tend to be more mature, more competitive, will slow down. And our strategy has been to build the business in new markets to a size where the higher growth rates in those new markets can have a meaningful impact on the total business. And that, in fact, is what's happening. The new markets are growing faster than the well-established core markets, and our assumption in guiding to decelerating growth rates is that, that trend would be reflected in the future. In terms of addition of hotels, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had significant growth in hotel counts. Again, with 155,000 hotels, I think you should expect for those growth rates over the long-term to slow down rather than to accelerate, although there's still a lot of hotels particularly in the new markets that we need to sign up for the international businesses. With respect to what we learned in the '08 slowdown, I think what we learned principally is there's really not much we can do about changes in currency exchange rates and changes in ADRs, which is what hurt our dollar-denominated reported results the most during the financial crisis. The other lesson that we learned though is that I think we did the right thing in continuing to invest aggressively in building out the international hotel platform and to invest aggressively in marketing. And I think those investments are still paying dividends for us today."

And with respect to the airline ticket business, I don't think there's been a fundamental change in shopping behavior. But as you guys know, airfares have gone up fairly substantially over the past couple of years. And that's especially true when you consider the impact of additional fees for baggage and things like that. And so American consumers have always been very active shoppers for airline tickets. They typically are going through a lot of different sites. And so I think, because we're one of the main brands, we benefit from that shopping activity to a degree and traffic, although sometimes it hurts our conversion. The other thing that I would mention though is I think our air team at priceline.com has done a very nice job of continuing to build the position in relevance of the opaque product so that when airfares are going up like they have, the airlines, I think are using the product as a tool to revenue-manage and keep their loads up as prices are going up. And that's worked well I think for the airlines, but it's also worked well for our opaque business."

I was wondering if you're seeing incremental demand, or is that just sort of early stages of growth in this business? And then second, I was curious on how important you think owning inventory in the Asian market is, or partnering up, with how Expedia partnered with AirAsia to secure a kind of air inventory, or Ctrip taking ownership in a hotel to get access to a hotel inventory, and MakeMyTrip kind of trying to also go into that Asia space as well.

We have not traditionally taken a principal position with inventory. That's something that consolidators did in the past, and that basically took away the hotel's control over their pricing, usually involved much higher margins than we charge, and we believe our business model is much more both hotel-friendly and even more important, consumer-friendly. And so, our efforts are really focused more on making sure that we've got availability, realtime, through our extranet rather than trying to sell up inventory. The AirAsia transaction is really a very different situation. We don't sell airline tickets in Asia. We only sell hotel reservations and a little bit of rental car. And I don't think you need to engage in that kind of partnership and trade off some of your equity and your business in order to get hotel inventory. The distribution model is attractive enough to hotels that they're happy to participate in it without that kind of an arrangement being a prerequisite. With respect to Ctrip and the hotel business in China, I think that's a unique market where it was very important for the whole market to increase the inventory of moderately priced hotels in China in order to help the entire travel industry grow for travelers inside of China. Right now, that's a smaller part of our business. We're focused much more on international travel to and from China. And therefore, that has not been an important part, at least our strategy in that market."

I don't have any particular comment to make about whether that has an impact on what we're seeing in the U.K. I think that part of that is driven by share shifts to low cost carriers and that sort of thing. So it's hard to correlate that to exactly what's happening in the online marketplace. And if you look at our competition, Expedia, I think posted attractive growth numbers. U.K. is a big market for them, so I don't think that you can drill any firm conclusions by what's going on in those other businesses. With respect to U.S. rental car business, our commentary on that is really more driven by the extent to which rental car companies are operating with very constrained fleets or with relatively unconstrained fleets. And in summer period, the fleets are very constrained, and there are a lot of -- you know better than I do, a lot of reasons why that happens. And I think this year, our experience has been so far that there was decent fleet availability to allow participation in some of the promotional channels and revenue management-type channels like our opaque. And as a result, we were pretty pleased with the numbers we were seeing there. The pricing in the rental car market seems to go sometimes in a very different direction from pricing in the other travel verticals. So in a time when hotel ADRs and airfares were coming down a couple of years ago, rental car prices were going up. Now, prices for airline tickets and hotels have been very firm really for a number of quarters, and rental car price is a little bit softer. I really don't have much beyond that."

It's a very interesting category. It's very well-suited to the Internet because of the fragmentation of supply and because of the critical need the consumer has to learn about the place they're going to stay. The Internet is just an excellent vehicle for delivering that information, and the development of social applications is a key ingredient there. And I think because consumers are so interested in participating in those applications, it's really got an ability to boost a business like Airbnb, and perhaps drive what I think they believe is really incremental business. It's not people that otherwise would have stayed in a hotel. The story that they tell about the starting of the business was a time when there were no hotel rooms available in San Francisco. And they were able to essentially rent out their air mattresses because there was no place for people to stay. And I think they're attracted to a category of traveler who might stay in the hotel but who, in fact, also might not. So in summary, we think it's a very interesting business. It's timely.

I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take question",456,"Thank you very much, and welcome to Priceline's Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions. 
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $5.8 billion, up 70% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $283 million or $5.49 per share, up 78% versus prior year. Second quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.91 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $36.1 million for the quarter, up 56% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our international business held firm during the quarter with 79% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from increased ADRs, impressive growth in new markets for Booking.com and high excellent growth rates for Agoda and TravelJigsaw. International hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply, with hotels now in over 110 countries worldwide. Booking.com grew its supply platform of 155,000 hotels at the fastest pace in over 3 years.
Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales around the world, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world. Bookings has also continued to execute well into its high season, not only expanding geographically, but also in securing availability in high-demand destinations, helping achieve high international growth rates this quarter.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 13% in the second quarter, due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs, and continued growth in airline ticket sales and higher airfares. Growth in opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line as airlines used the opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 45% continues to reflect growth in the domestic merchant businesses. That was primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant bookings. Agoda reported higher year-over-year growth rates in gross bookings as it comp-ed last year's civil strife in Thailand, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. TravelJigsaw delivered better-than-anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in building toward the high season.
In summary, the growth in the group's international hotel business exceeded our forecast in the second quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brand's expansion in new markets and their hard work in preparing for high-season travel. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,138198199,152858,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%. H",2378,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2011. Q2 operating performance was exceptional, led by year-over-year gross bookings growth of 70%. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 56% in the second quarter, maintaining the same strong level of growth that was generated in the first quarter. 
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 4% for our international hotel service and by almost 8% for our U.S. hotel service for Q2 2011, compared to the prior year second quarter. These increases were favorable to our assumptions for Q2 guidance. 
FX rates for the second quarter were unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, currency exchange rates provided a substantial tailwind when compared to the prior year second quarter FX rates. The average exchange rates for the second quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling were approximately 14% and 9% higher, respectively, than the average exchange rates for Q2 2010. 
Our international gross bookings grew by 98% and by 79% on a local currency basis for Q2 2011 compared to the prior year. Our Booking.com and Agoda businesses once again delivered outstanding results. It exceeded our expectations when we gave guidance for the quarter back on May 4. 
Our forecast was based upon the growth rates we saw through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would further decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to see acceleration in our unit growth rates over the more seasonally significant back half of the quarter. The outstanding unit growth, as well as some ADR favorability versus guidance, drove results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. 
Performance across key markets was good. We saw continued strong growth rates in our core European market in Q2. Faster-growing markets for our international business, including Asia-Pacific, North America and South America, continued to grow at levels that exceeded our consolidated unit growth rate. These markets are increasing as a percentage of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective and are, therefore, having a more pronounced impact on our overall growth rate.
TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in late 2010, contributed $154 million in gross bookings in Q2 as compared to $44 million included in Q2 2010 from the point we acquired the business on May 18, 2010. Rental car days booked for the group were up by 55% versus second quarter 2010, including the impact of TravelJigsaw. Since we have now lapped the May 2010 acquisition, we will not separately report gross bookings for TravelJigsaw in future quarters. 
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 13% is at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Name Your Own Price hotel room night growth decelerated, likely as a result of competitors' initiatives in the opaque hotel arena.
Airline tickets booked were up by 7% in the quarter, resulting mainly from strong growth in Name Your Own Price airline tickets. A 4% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. Opaque rental car performed well due to improved access to discounted rates compared to the first quarter. The strong performance in gross bookings helped drive bottom-line performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit was $749 million and grew 68% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $612 million, an increase of 90% as compared to the prior year or 71% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $137 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by higher-than-forecasted online advertising expense, which was consistent with our gross booking's over-performance. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance as a result of better-than-assumed ad efficiency, but came in higher than the second quarter of 2010. 
The variance versus prior year was caused by the significant level of growth for our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend than our U.S. business. Consequently, online ad spend increased as a percentage of gross profit in Q2, even though we were pleased with the underlying advertising efficiency for our brands.
We will discuss operating leverage this quarter and in the future based upon non-GAAP operating income rather than adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit. We believe this is a more accurate leverage metric, because FX gains and losses from our short-term earnings hedges shield adjusted EBITDA but not gross profit. And therefore, changes in exchange rates create anomalous leverage comparisons from period to period. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in our earnings release provides detail on the calculation of non-GAAP operating income.
Non-GAAP operating income expressed as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.2% for Q2 2011, which represents an increase in leverage of 210 basis points versus prior year Q2. Although we had some de-leverage in online advertising as I just discussed, our other operating expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit, resulting in improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $9 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to less FX hedging and transaction losses than assumed for guidance, as the euro weakened after we gave guidance. 
Our cash income tax rate was favorable to prior year and our guidance forecast. During second quarter, we increased our estimate of the impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit on our annual effective tax rate. We now expect the Innovation Box benefit to reduce our 2011 income tax rate by 2 to 4 percentage points. The additional benefit is reflected in our second quarter tax expense, as well as a benefit of about $2 million reflecting the cumulative catch-up impact of the change on our first quarter tax provision. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $349 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $320 million and represents 71% growth versus prior year. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $223 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2011, which represents a 19% increase versus prior year.
During our last earnings call, I highlighted that operating cash flow was impacted by the timing of approximately $124 million of withholding tax payments, which were accrued in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter. This timing difference had a favorable impact on operating cash flow for the first quarter and an offsetting unfavorable impact for the second quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, is 71% higher than the prior year comparable period. We spent about $10 million on CapEx in the quarter and paid about $13 million in the quarter to purchase a portion of the noncontrolling interest in TravelJigsaw.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $1.9 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.4 billion. We also have a $175-million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and expires in September 2012. 
Now for the third quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects exceptional top line performance, driven primarily by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.43 per euro and $1.64 per British pound of yesterday's closing rates. At or near these exchange rates, our euro and pound denominated results will be substantially higher expressed in U.S. dollars than they would've been at the prior year average exchange rates.
Specifically, average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 would be stronger by about 11% for the euro and by about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. However, as we have emphasized in the past and want to remind you again, volatility in the euro/dollar exchange rate, which seems to be the rule rather than the exception in the recent past, can materially impact our U.S.-denominated earnings. 
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 47% to 52%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 8% to 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 62% to 67% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. 
The midpoint of this range represents a significant sequential decrease from Q2 results. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease are a softer Q2 comp a year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp. Our local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially. Also, for the first time, the prior year Q3 includes TravelJigsaw for the full period. 
Finally, our guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q3 will be less than that experienced in Q2 for both our international and U.S. hotel services. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 37% to 42% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 54% to 59%. 
I'll now give guidance for Q3 operating expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide top line and bottom line guidance, but we plan to cease our practice of providing line-by-line guidance for each operating expense line item.
We are targeting Q3 consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $273 million to $283 million, with about $8 million of that amount being spent for offline advertising. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $40 million and $45 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $78 million and $83 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $27 million to $32 million. We expect information technology costs of about $10 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $6 million.
We expect total non-GAAP other income expense recorded below operating income to amount to expense of approximately $6 million for Q3 2011 compared to expense of about $12 million in Q3 2010. Other expense is higher for Q3 2010 because it includes about $6 million related to FX hedging losses, as the euro strengthened during the quarter after we entered our hedge contracts. 
Other income and expense is comprised primarily of foreign exchange losses and transaction costs, net interest expense and the charge for net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. Non-GAAP other income expense excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled to convertible debt and includes the additional impact of other non-GAAP adjustments on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $595 million and $615 million, which at the midpoint represents 67% growth versus prior year. Our guidance assumes that we will expand operating leverage by approximately 270 basis points as our gross profit grows at a faster pace than our operating expenses.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9.10 to $9.30 per share, which at the midpoint represents 73% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 20%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our cash income tax rate has generally been increasing as compared to prior year periods due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to U.S. earnings, where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. 
This cash tax rate reflects an assumed 2 to 4 percentage point benefit from the Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. The impact of the Innovation Box benefit is likely to grow in 2012 as we complete the phase-in period. In 2012, we estimate that the Innovation Box benefit could reduce our consolidated cash income tax rate by approximately 4 to 6 percentage points.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $521.97. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $8.37 to $8.57 per share for Q3. 
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses, the beneficial impact in Q2 of reversing the 2010 reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings.
We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements. 
We are pleased with the top line performance of the business in Q2 and inherent in the guidance for Q3. As we have emphasized in prior earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future, due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods, which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs. 
Thus far, quarter-to-date, we assume deceleration in year-over-year unit growth rates compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our guidance reflects this actual deceleration and assumes that the deceleration will continue through the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance also assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. 
We will now take your questions."

Justin, in terms of saturation levels, we consistently said that it's our expectation that the growth rates in our core markets, which tend to be more mature and more competitive, will slow down. And our strategy has been to build the business in new markets to a size where the higher growth rates in those new markets can have a meaningful impact on the total business. And that, in fact, is what's happening. The new markets are growing faster than the well-established core markets, and our assumption in guiding to decelerating growth rates is that, that trend would be reflected in the future. In terms of addition of hotels, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had significant growth in hotel counts. Again, with 155,000 hotels, I think you should expect for those growth rates over the long-term to slow down rather than to accelerate, although there's still a lot of hotels, particularly in the new markets, that we need to sign up for the international businesses. With respect to what we learned in the '08 slowdown, I think what we learned principally is there's really not much we can do about changes in currency exchange rates and changes in ADRs, which is what hurt our dollar-denominated reported results the most during the financial crisis. The other lesson that we learned, though, is that I think we did the right thing in continuing to invest aggressively in building out the international hotel platform and to invest aggressively in marketing. And I think those investments are still paying dividends for us today."

But as you guys know, airfares have gone up fairly substantially over the past couple of years. And that's especially true when you consider the impact of additional fees for baggage and things like that. And so American consumers have always been very active shoppers for airline tickets. They typically are going to a lot of different sites. And so I think, because we're one of the main brands, we benefit from that shopping activity to a degree in traffic, although sometimes it hurts our conversion. The other thing that I would mention, though, is I think our air team at Priceline.com has done a very nice job of continuing to build the position and relevance of the opaque product, so that when airfares are going up like they have, the airlines, I think, are using the product as a tool to revenue-manage and keep their loads up as prices are going up. And that's worked well, I think, for the airlines, but it's also worked well for our opaque business."

And then second, I was curious on how important you think owning inventory in the Asia market is, or partnering up, with how Expedia partnered with AirAsia to secure a kind of air inventory, or Ctrip taking ownership in a hotel to get access to hotel inventory, and MakeMyTrip kind of trying to also go into that Asia space as well.

We have not traditionally taken a principal position with inventory. That's something that consolidators did in the past, and that basically took away the hotel's control over their pricing, usually involved much higher margins than we charge. And we believe our business model is much more both hotel-friendly and even more important, consumer-friendly. And so, our efforts are really focused more on making sure that we've got availability, real time, through our extranet rather than trying to sell up inventory. The AirAsia transaction is really a very different situation. We don't sell airline tickets in Asia. We only sell hotel reservations and a little bit of rental car. And I don't think you need to engage in that kind of partnership and trade off some of your equity in your business in order to get hotel inventory. The distribution model is attractive enough to hotels that they're happy to participate in it without that kind of an arrangement being a prerequisite. With respect to Ctrip and the hotel business in China, I think that's a unique market, where it was very important for the whole market to increase the inventory of moderately priced hotels in China in order to help the entire travel industry grow for travelers inside of China. Right now, that's a smaller part of our business. We're focused much more on international travel to and from China and therefore, that has not been an important part, at least our strategy in that market."

I don't have any particular comment to make about whether that has an impact on what we're seeing in the U.K. I think that part of that is driven by share shift to low cost carriers and that sort of thing. So it's hard to correlate that to exactly what's happening in the online marketplace. And if you look at our competition, Expedia, I think, posted attractive growth numbers. U.K. is a big market for them, so I don't think that you can draw any firm conclusions by what's going on in those other businesses. With respect to U.S. rental car business, our commentary on that is really more driven by the extent to which rental car companies are operating with very constrained fleets or with relatively unconstrained fleets. And in some summer periods, the fleets are very constrained, and there are a lot of -- you know better than I do, a lot of reasons why that happens. And I think this year, our experience has been so far that there was decent fleet availability to allow participation in some of the promotional channels and revenue management-type channels like our opaque. And as a result, we were pretty pleased with the numbers we were seeing there. The pricing in the rental car market seems to go sometimes in a very different direction from pricing in the other travel verticals. So in a time when hotel ADRs and airfares were coming down a couple of years ago, rental car prices were going up. Now, prices for airline tickets and hotels have been very firm really for a number of quarters, and rental car price is a little bit softer. I really don't have much beyond that."

And I think because consumers are so interested in participating in those applications, it's really got an ability to boost a business like Airbnb, and perhaps drive what I think they believe is really incremental business. It's not people that otherwise would have stayed in a hotel. The story that they tell about the starting of the business was a time when there were no hotel rooms available in San Francisco. And they were able to essentially rent out their air mattresses because there was no place for people to stay. And I think they're attracted to a category of traveler who might stay in the hotel but who, in fact, also might not. So in summary, we think it's a very interesting business. It's timely. I think it represents a potential nice addition to the vacation rental market for those homeowners who want to use their transaction processing capability. And I think that's something that's exciting for Airbnb. And we wish them the best.
Well, I think, according to the operator, that was our last question. So we thank everybody for participating in the call."

Welcome to Priceline's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.P",547,"Thank you very much. Welcome to Priceline's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $6.3 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $513 million or $9.95 per share, up 88% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $9.30 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $40.6 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our International businesses surpassed our guidance with 61% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rate benefited generally from growth in you markets from Booking.com, continued high absolute growth rate fors Agoda and TravelJigsaw and increased hotel ADRs. International Hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply, with Booking.com hotels and other accommodations up 62% year-over-year to 170,000. Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales in high-growth markets, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world.
As one indicator of its progress, Booking.com has opened 20 local supply offices during the last 12 months. Priceline's domestic gross bookings growth held steady at 13% in the third quarter, due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs, growth in airline ticket sales with higher airfares and growth in rental car reservations. Growth in opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line, as airlines used the opaque channel as revenue management tool while they increased fares.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 36% is primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant bookings. Most of the sequential decline in merchant growth is attributable to passing the anniversary of the TravelJigsaw acquisition.
Agoda reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. Flooding in Thailand is having an impact on travel to that important regional destination. The Agoda and Booking teams are doing a great job serving customers needing to cancel and booking vacations to unaffected destinations. Agoda is also doing a nice job building business to destinations outside of Asia Pacific, but the majority of its business is for trips within the region.
TravelJigsaw delivered better-than-anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in acquiring stock for the high season. The team also continues to work on improvements that will drive business next year and beyond.
In summary, the growth in the group's international Hotel business exceeded our forecast in the third quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in building their businesses and gaining share on the competition. We are also pleased with the solid momentum displayed by our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, especially given the sheer size of the business and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in which we are operating.
I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a strong quarter from a topline growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 56% as the business gained market share both internationally and in the U.S. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 47% in the third quarter as we saw deceleration compared to the 56% unit growth rates achieved in Q2 2011. As we mentioned, when we gave Q3 guidance, we expect this higher level of deceleration because we had a softer Q2 comp a year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp, where local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially.
Also Q3 is the first quarter where TravelJigsaw is included for the full prior year period. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2011. In both cases, slightly unfavorable to our assumptions for Q2 guidance.
FX rates for the third quarter were also slightly unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, third quarter currency exchange rates provided substantial benefits to our results expressed in U.S. dollars and compared to the prior year FX rates.
The average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling were approximately 9% and 4% higher respectively than the average exchange rates for Q3 2010. Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 73% and by 61% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
The guidance we gave on August 4 was based upon actual results through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates will continue to decelerate further as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our International business didn't decelerate as assumed in our forecast. Rental car days booked were up by 36%. As we just mentioned, this represents organic growth as TravelJigsaw is included for the entire prior year period. We will no longer disclose TravelJigsaw gross bookings separately, but the growth rate for the business is well in excess of this consolidated unit growth rate.
Gross bookings for our U.S. business of 13% was at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher your ADRs were key drivers. Many hotel room nights declined slightly likely as a result of competitors discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 8% in the quarter, reflecting good growth mainly on price and retail airline tickets. A 7% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. 
The U.S. rental car business had a good quarter helped by availability of discounted rates. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom-line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 65% as compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $952 million, which constituted an increase of 80% as compared to the prior year, and an increase of 68% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $248 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which is consistent with our gross bookings over performance. Online advertising expenses as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance and prior year Q3 as a result of decelerating gross bookings growth and better than assumed ad efficiency, partly offset by business mix. 
Our International business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business driving the mix impact.
Sales and marketing expense also exceeded guidance due to increased spending to build content, as well as higher credit card processing costs resulting from a gross booking overperformance for our international merchant businesses. We had a nice expansion in operating leverage in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income, as a percentage of gross profit, amounted to 58% for Q3 2011 as compared to 54.9% for the prior year. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $6 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The various relates mainly to FX hedging gains that resulted from the euro weakening after we gave guidance.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $644 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $595 million to $615 million, and represents 78% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 88% including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box tax benefit and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2011, which represents an 84% increase versus prior year.
We spent about $12 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $30 million on a year-to-date basis through September 30, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office buildouts to support growth and geographic expansion. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.4 billion exceeds our outstanding debt balance by about $1.8 billion. We issued an 8-K last week to report that we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a 5-year term, and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost.
Now for fourth quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects modest deceleration in unit growth through our worldwide hotel reservation business. FX rates provided a substantial tailwind to our results expressed in U.S. dollars for Q2 and Q3, but not for Q4. The euro and British pound exchange rates decreased from $1.43 per euro and $1.64 per British pound that prevailed when we reported our second quarter earnings. Our Q4 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.38 per euro and $1.60 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates fairly similar to those that prevailed in Q4 2010. At or near these exchange rates, our local currency growth rates will be similar to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.
However, it is important to remember, given the sovereign debt issues facing Europe that we are likely to see volatility in the euro dollar exchange rate, which could materially impact our U.S. denominated results. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuations in the euro or pound versus the dollar, which were now at the end of the quarter. But these hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 39% to 44%, with U.S. gross bookings going to approximately 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 50% to 55% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. Our guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q4 will be less than what we experienced in Q3 for our international hotel service and about the same as Q3 for our U.S. hotels service.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 27% to 32%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 42% to 47%. As I noted last quarter, we will no longer give guidance for operating expenses on a line-by-line basis. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at about the same rate as gross profit, which would result in stable operating leverage with prior year Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $330 million, which at the midpoint represents 44% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.90 to $5 per share, which at the midpoint represents 46% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 19%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $513.37 per share.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.23 to $4.33 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses and to the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interest or certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, to hotel margin tax, judges, rulings or settlements.
We are pleased with the topline performance for the business reported in Q3 and inherent in the guidance for Q4. As we have stated in previous calls, considering the share side of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods which had into the economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs, we generally expect they we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future. Our guidance reflects actual results to date, and assumes that our growth rate will decelerate through the remainder of the quarter.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results today, we have seen short-term volatility on our unit growth rates and cancellation rates for our International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and commissions in the consumer travel market in particular. Our forecast reflects the negative impact of observed thus far from recent severe flooding in Thailand, which is a key market for our go to business and the Asian business of Booking.com. If the impact of the flooding in Bangkok were to worsen, our forecast would negatively impacted to a greater extent. We will now take your questions."

So the newer markets, being North America for Booking.com, Asia Pacific and South America are still growing at faster rate than our overall consolidated growth rate, but the core markets, Western Europe, Southern Europe continue to post very strong growth for us, and are still big enough percentage of the total business. But if they were impacted dramatically, you'd notice that in our reported results. In terms of the online advertising, we did have an improvement as a percentage of gross profit versus the prior year. That's principally due to the investments that we made the last couple of quarters. So we were telling you that one of the reasons that the online advertising as a percentage of gross bookings is higher is that our gross bookings were growing at a faster rate, and those gross bookings would turn into checkouts and revenue, particularly in Q3, which is the seasonal peak for travel for Booking.com. And we saw that happen in Q3. So our gross profit proved at the faster rate than our gross bookings where we had some deceleration, so you see favorable relationship there. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, and that was partly offset by the mix impact of our International business growing faster than our U.S. business. Internationally, we spent a higher spent for online advertising than in the U.S. where it's more repeat customers, and we also have our off-line advertising program."

There's no good published research for where this number could go. We've seen very significant growth in this number over the past couple of years, which we reported to you. I think it would be reasonable to expect the growth rate of hotel additions to go down over time. But there's still a lot of opportunity out there. There's a lot of definitions that we're fairly new in. There's a lot of countries where we may have done a good job of developing inventory in the major cities but haven't really gotten out into the smaller villages and towns yet. We have, not only on Booking.com, we have not only hotels, but we also have vacation rentals and bed and breakfast and other types of accommodation, which really opens up development to a much larger number of properties, but those companies would tend to have fewer rooms in them than the larger hotels in the big cities. So those are some of the things to think about when you're looking at that number, and it's also one of the reasons why we really can't give a hard number that this is how many hotels there are in the world, and we'll be satisfied when we have all of them. With respect to mergers and acquisitions, we typically said that they're interested in companies that provide us with new products, new geography, new distribution, in other words, a good brand that has its own customer base that is attractive to us.

Google has launched a product providing vertical search results for both air and hotel. The air is based on the IP search engine, and the hotel is principally based on content that Google received, it's mostly from intermediaries, online travel agents and to a lesser extent, directly from the hotels themselves. Looking at how Google has approached that doesn't this product, it's clear that they would like to have these platforms operated as efficient vehicle for advertisers to get qualified leads because a customer will have seen more information on Google by the time they click on to an advertising link. And if you look at the hotel product, the online travel agents are very prominently featured in the display. With respect to the flight search, that's not the case. I believe, although I don't know first hand, that's principally because our limitations that have been placed on Google by the airlines. However, Google has said, and it appears that they're trying to find opportunities for online travel agents to advertise on the air platform as well. Our approach, as an advertiser on Google, is to try to understand their products as best we can and participate in them as effectively as we can, and that's how we've approached the hotel product in particular. A lot of people are concerned about Google's market power, and that it could be anything competitive coming out of those and a number of companies, not including ours by the way, raised comment and criticism of the ITA transaction as part of the antitrust approval of that transaction. But the transaction was approved.

A number of major industrial parts have been flooded, and people who have been looking at the news have seen primarily concern about supply chain for the automotive and tech industries since so much of the manufacturing of components happens in Thailand. The concern was, as the floodwaters move from north to south that they would encroach on Bangkok. And in fact, they have encroached on sections of the city to the north, it's created a lot of very serious dislocation, human dislocation. People have to move out of their homes and so forth, and there's still a worry that floodwaters might get to the center business district of the city, which would create additional problems. And furthermore, the main international airport in Bangkok remains open. The secondary airport was taken out by floods. If something happened to make the main international airport unavailable, that obviously would pose problems for travel. Even though Thailand is an important tourist destination, a leisure destination for the business both Agoda and Booking.com and the region, just because of the size and the balance of all the other businesses, the impact to date has not been material to our consolidated results. If that were to worsen, I think it will be difficult to foresee that being material to our business as a whole, but it certainly could be problematic for our Asian business."

There's been a lot consolidation among the major airlines, here in the United States. One of the consequences of that consolidation is removal of redundant roads and retirement of aircraft and so forth, and I think that's part of the come and it's also part and parcel of the airlines need to keep their fares up, so they have appropriate operating margins. I think most people in the business believe that the high airfares and reductions in capacity do have an impact on leisure travel, in particular. And that may generate substitution, although I don't have any data on that. But if you look at our business in the United States, and growing at a little bit more 10% here throughout the course of the year. Certainly, that's higher than the travel space in general. And I think the reason that we're able to do that is because we add new products and improved the website, and launched effective marketing campaign to drive a little business. But there's no question that higher airfares and less capacity will be a factor for leisure travel demand going forward. With respect to the car rental business, we had, I think, good availability of inventory for all of our businesses around the world in the third quarter. We didn't have a situation where fleet was overly tight, and we couldn't get opaque inventory.

Welcome to Priceline's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.P",548,"Thank you very much. Welcome to Priceline's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $6.3 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $513 million, or $9.95 per share, up 88% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $9.30 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $40.6 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our international businesses surpassed our guidance with 61% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from growth in new markets from Booking.com, continued high absolute growth rates for Agoda and TravelJigsaw and increased hotel ADRs. International hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply, with Booking.com hotels and other accommodations up 62% year-over-year to 170,000. Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales in high-growth markets, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world.
As one indicator of its progress, Booking.com has opened 20 local supply offices during the last 12 months. Priceline's domestic gross bookings growth held steady at 13% in the third quarter, due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs, growth in airline ticket sales with higher airfares and growth in rental car reservations. Growth in opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line, as airlines used the opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 36% is primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant bookings. Most of the sequential decline in merchant growth is attributable to passing the anniversary of the TravelJigsaw acquisition.
Agoda reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. Flooding in Thailand is having an impact on travel to that important regional destination. The Agoda and Booking teams are doing a great job serving customers needing to cancel and booking vacations to unaffected destinations. Agoda is also doing a nice job building business to destinations outside of Asia Pacific, but the majority of its business is for trips within the region.
TravelJigsaw delivered better-than-anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in acquiring stock for the high season. The team also continues to work on improvements that will drive business next year and beyond.
In summary, the growth in the group's international hotel business exceeded our forecast in the third quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in building their businesses and gaining share on the competition. We are also pleased with the solid momentum displayed by our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, especially given the sheer size of the business and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in which we are operating.
I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 56% as the business gained market share both internationally and in the U.S. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 47% in the third quarter as we saw deceleration compared to the 56% unit growth rate achieved in Q2 2011. As we mentioned, when we gave Q3 guidance, we expected this higher level of deceleration because we had a softer Q2 comp a year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp, where local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially.
Also Q3 is the first quarter where TravelJigsaw is included for the full prior year period. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2011. In both cases, slightly unfavorable to our assumptions for Q3 guidance.
FX rates for the third quarter were also slightly unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, third quarter currency exchange rates provided substantial benefits to our results expressed in U.S. dollars when compared to the prior year FX rates.
The average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling were approximately 9% and 4% higher, respectively, than the average exchange rates for Q3 2010. Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 73% and by 61% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
The guidance we gave on August 4 was based upon actual results through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would continue to decelerate further as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our international business didn't decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast. Rental car days booked were up by 36%. As I just mentioned, this represents organic growth as TravelJigsaw is included for the entire prior year period. We will no longer disclose TravelJigsaw gross bookings separately, but the growth rate for the business is well in excess of this consolidated unit growth rate.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 13% was at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly likely as a result of competitors discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 8% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in Name Your Own Price and retail airline tickets. A 7% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. 
The U.S. rental car business had a good quarter helped by availability of discounted rates. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 65% as compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $952 million, which constituted an increase of 80% as compared to the prior year, and an increase of 68% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted $248 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which is consistent with our gross bookings over performance. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance and prior year Q3 as a result of decelerating gross bookings growth and better than assumed ad efficiency, partly offset by business mix. 
Our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business driving the mixed impact.
Sales and marketing expense also exceeded guidance due to increased spending to build content, as well as higher credit card processing costs resulting from a gross booking overperformance for our international merchant businesses. We had a nice expansion in operating leverage in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income, as a percentage of gross profit, amounted to 58% for Q3 2011 as compared to 54.9% for the prior year. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $6 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging gains that resulted from the euro weakening after we gave guidance.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $644 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $595 million to $615 million, and represents 78% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 88% including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2011, which represents an 84% increase versus prior year.
We spent about $12 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $30 million on a year-to-date basis through September 30, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office buildouts to support growth and geographic expansion. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.4 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.8 billion. We issued an 8-K last week to report that we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a 5-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost.
Now for fourth quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects modest deceleration in unit growth for our worldwide hotel reservation business. FX rates provided a substantial tailwind to our results expressed in U.S. dollars for Q2 and Q3, but not for Q4. The euro and British pound exchange rates decreased from $1.43 per euro and $1.64 per British pound that prevailed when we reported our second quarter earnings. Our Q4 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.38 per euro and $1.60 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates fairly similar to those that prevailed in Q4 2010. At or near these exchange rates, our local currency growth rates will be similar to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.
However, it is important to remember, given the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, that we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our U.S. denominated results. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuations in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 39% to 44%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 50% to 55% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. Our guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q4 will be less than what we experienced in Q3 for our international hotel service and about the same as Q3 for our U.S. hotels service.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 27% to 32%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 42% to 47%. As I noted last quarter, we will no longer give guidance for operating expenses on a line-by-line basis. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at about the same rate as gross profit, which would result in stable operating leverage with prior year Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $330 million, which at the midpoint represents 44% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.90 to $5 per share, which at the midpoint represents 46% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 19%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $513.37 per share.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.23 to $4.33 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.
We are pleased with the top line performance for the business reported in Q3 and inherent in the guidance for Q4. As we have stated on previous calls, considering the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs, we generally expect that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and assumes that our growth rate will decelerate through the remainder of the quarter.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and cancellation rates for our international business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and commissions in the consumer travel market in particular. Our forecast reflects the negative impact observed thus far from recent severe flooding in Thailand, which is a key market for our go-to business and the Asian business of Booking.com. If the impact of the flooding in Bangkok were to worsen, our forecast would be negatively impacted to a greater extent. We will now take your questions."

In terms of market performance, Tom, we saw strong performance across all of our markets. So the newer markets, being North America for Booking.com, Asia Pacific and South America are still growing at faster rates than our overall consolidated growth rate, but the core markets, Western Europe, Southern Europe continue to post very strong growth for us, and are still a big enough percentage of the total business. But if they were impacted dramatically, you'd notice that in our reported results. In terms of the online advertising, we did have an improvement as a percentage of gross profit versus the prior year. That's principally due to the investments that we made the last couple of quarters. So we were telling you that one of the reasons that the online advertising as a percentage of gross bookings is higher is that our gross bookings were growing at a faster rate, and that those gross bookings would turn into checkouts and revenue, particularly in Q3, which is the seasonal peak for travel for Booking.com. And we saw that happen in Q3. So our gross profit grew at a faster rate than our gross bookings where we had some deceleration, so you see a favorable relationship there. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, and that was partly offset by the mixed impact of our international business growing faster than our U.S. business. Internationally, we spent a higher percentage for online advertising than in the U.S. where it's more repeat customers, and we also have our offline advertising program."

There's no good published research for where this number could go. We've seen very significant growth in this number over the past couple of years, which we have reported to you. I think it would be reasonable to expect the growth rate of hotel additions to go down over time. But there's still a lot of opportunity out there. There's a lot of destinations that we're fairly new in. There's a lot of countries where we may have done a good job of developing inventory in the major cities but haven't really gotten out into the smaller villages and towns yet. We have, not only on Booking.com, we have not only hotels, but we also have vacation rentals and bed and breakfast and other types of accommodation, which really opens up development to a much larger number of properties, but those properties would tend to have fewer rooms in them than the larger hotels in the big cities. So those are some of the things to think about when you're looking at that number, and it's also one of the reasons why we really can't give a hard number that this is how many hotels there are in the world, and we'll be satisfied when we have all of them. With respect to mergers and acquisitions, we typically said that we're interested in companies that provide us with new products, new geography, new distribution, in other words, a good brand that has its own customer base that is attractive to us.

Google has launched a products providing vertical search results for both air and hotel. The air is based on the IPA search engine, and the hotel is principally based on content that Google receives, mostly from intermediaries, online travel agents and to a lesser extent, directly from the hotels themselves. Looking at how Google has approached the test of these products, it's clear that they would like to have these platforms operate as efficient vehicle for advertisers to get qualified leads because a customer will have seen more information on Google by the time they click on to an advertising link. And if you look at the hotel product, the online travel agents are very prominently featured in the display. With respect to the flight search, that's not the case. And I believe, although I don't know first hand, that's principally because our limitations would have been placed on Google by the airlines. However, Google has said, and it appears that they're trying to find opportunities for online travel agents to advertise on the air platform as well. Our approach, as an advertiser on Google, is to try to understand their products the best we can and participate in them as effectively as we can, and that's how we've approached the hotel product in particular. A lot of people are concerned about Google's market power, and rather there could be anything in the competitive coming out of those and a number of other companies, not including ours by the way, raised comments and criticism of the ITA transaction as part of the anti-trust approval of that transaction. But the transaction was approved. The products are out of the marketplace, and I think it's incumbent upon our industry to try to find the best ways that we can integrate with the product and to advertise on it, and try to get the well-qualified customers that I think Google is trying to drive towards us."

A number of major industrial parks have been flooded, and people who have been looking at the news have seen primary concern about supply chain for the automotive and tech industries since so much of the manufacturing of components happens in Thailand. The concern was, as the floodwaters move from north to south that they would encroach on Bangkok. And in fact, they have encroached on sections of the city to the north, and it's created a lot of very serious dislocation, human dislocation, people having to move out of their homes and so forth. And there's still a worry that floodwaters might get to the center business district of the city, which would create additional problems. And furthermore, the main international airport in Bangkok remains open. The secondary airport was taken out by floods. If something happened to make the main international airport unavailable, that obviously would pose problems for travel. Even though Thailand is an important tourist destination, a leisure destination for the business of both Agoda and Booking.com in the region, just because of the size and the balance of all the other businesses, the impact to date has not been material to our consolidated results. If that were to worsen, I think it'd be difficult to foresee that being material to our business as a whole, but it certainly could be problematic for our Asian business."

There's been a lot consolidation among the major airlines here in the United States. And one of the consequences of that consolidation is removal of redundant roads and retirement of aircraft and so forth, and I think that's part of it and it's also part and parcel of the airlines' need to keep their fares up, so they have appropriate operating margins. I think most people in the business believe that high airfares and reductions in capacity do have an impact on leisure travel, in particular. And that may generate substitution, although I don't have any data on that. But if you look at our business in the United States, been growing at a little bit more than 10% here throughout the course of the year. Certainly, that's higher than the travel space in general. And I think the reason that we're able to do that is because we add new products and improved the website, and launched effective marketing campaigns and are able to drive a little business. But there's no question that higher airfares and less capacity will be a factor for leisure travel demand going forward. With respect to the car rental business, we had, I think, good availability of inventory for all of our businesses around the world in the third quarter. We didn't have a situation where fleet was overly tight and we couldn't get opaque inventory. And we certainly were able to generate one-off inventory for significant bookings growth at TravelJigsaw that we mentioned.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $6.3 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $513 million, or $9.95 per share, up 88% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $9.30 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $40.6 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Growth rates for our international businesses surpassed our guidance with 61% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited generally from growth in new markets from Booking.com, continued high absolute growth rates for Agoda and TravelJigsaw and increased hotel ADRs. International hotel gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply, with Booking.com hotels and other accommodations up 62% year-over-year to 170,000. Booking.com continues to build inventory and sales in high-growth markets, delivering growth in reservations to new destinations and growing demand in those destinations for hotels around the world.
As one indicator of its progress, Booking.com has opened 20 local supply offices during the last 12 months. Priceline's domestic gross bookings growth held steady at 13% in the third quarter, due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings, aided by improved ADRs, growth in airline ticket sales with higher airfares and growth in rental car reservations. Growth in opaque air tickets again helped the domestic top and bottom line, as airlines used the opaque channel as a revenue management tool while they increased fares.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 36% is primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represent a significant share of merchant bookings. Most of the sequential decline in merchant growth is attributable to passing the anniversary of the TravelJigsaw acquisition.
Agoda reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. Flooding in Thailand is having an impact on travel to that important regional destination. The Agoda and Booking teams are doing a great job serving customers needing to cancel and booking vacations to unaffected destinations. Agoda is also doing a nice job building business to destinations outside of Asia Pacific, but the majority of its business is for trips within the region.
TravelJigsaw delivered better-than-anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter through solid execution in acquiring stock for the high season. The team also continues to work on improvements that will drive business next year and beyond.
In summary, the growth in the group's international hotel business exceeded our forecast in the third quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in building their businesses and gaining share on the competition. We are also pleased with the solid momentum displayed by our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, especially given the sheer size of the business and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in which we are operating.
I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 56% as the business gained market share both internationally and in the U.S. Hotel room nights booked grew year-over-year by 47% in the third quarter as we saw deceleration compared to the 56% unit growth rate achieved in Q2 2011. As we mentioned, when we gave Q3 guidance, we expected this higher level of deceleration because we had a softer Q2 comp a year ago and a tougher Q3 2010 comp, where local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially.
Also Q3 is the first quarter where TravelJigsaw is included for the full prior year period. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2011. In both cases, slightly unfavorable to our assumptions for Q3 guidance.
FX rates for the third quarter were also slightly unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. However, third quarter currency exchange rates provided a substantial benefit to our results expressed in U.S. dollars when compared to the prior year FX rates.
The average exchange rates for the third quarter of 2011 for the euro and the pound sterling were approximately 9% and 4% higher, respectively, than the average exchange rates for Q3 2010. Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 73% and by 61% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
The guidance we gave on August 4 was based upon actual results through that date, and as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would continue to decelerate further as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our international business didn't decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast. Rental car days booked were up by 36%. As I just mentioned, this represents organic growth as TravelJigsaw is included for the entire prior year period. We will no longer disclose TravelJigsaw gross bookings separately, but the growth rate for the business is well in excess of this consolidated unit growth rate.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 13% was at the top end of our guidance range. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly likely as a result of competitors discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 8% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in Name Your Own Price and retail airline tickets. A 7% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. 
The U.S. rental car business had a good quarter helped by availability of discounted rates. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 65% as compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $952 million, which constituted an increase of 80% as compared to the prior year, and an increase of 68% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted $148 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Total operating expenses came in above our guidance, driven primarily by higher than forecasted online advertising expense, which is consistent with our gross bookings over performance. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was slightly favorable to our guidance and prior year Q3 as a result of decelerating gross bookings growth and better than assumed ad efficiency, partly offset by business mix. 
Our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business driving the mixed impact.
Sales and marketing expense also exceeded guidance due to increased spending to build content, as well as higher credit card processing costs resulting from a gross booking over-performance for our international merchant businesses. We had a nice expansion in operating leverage in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income, as a percentage of gross profit, amounted to 58% for Q3 2011 as compared to 54.9% for the prior year. Non-GAAP other expense recorded below operating income in the quarter amounted to $3 million, which is lower than the $6 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging gains that resulted from the euro weakening after we gave guidance.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $644 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $595 million to $615 million, and represents 78% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 88% including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2011, which represents an 84% increase versus prior year.
We spent about $12 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $30 million on a year-to-date basis through September 30, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office buildouts to support growth and geographic expansion. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.4 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $1.8 billion. We issued an 8-K last week to report that we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a 5-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost.
Now for fourth quarter 2011 guidance. Our forecast reflects modest deceleration in unit growth for our worldwide hotel reservation business. FX rates provided a substantial tailwind to our results expressed in U.S. dollars for Q2 and Q3, but not for Q4. The euro and British pound exchange rates decreased from $1.43 per euro and $1.64 per British pound that prevailed when we reported our second quarter earnings. Our Q4 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.38 per euro and $1.60 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates fairly similar to those that prevailed in Q4 2010. At or near these exchange rates, our local currency growth rates will be similar to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.
However, it is important to remember, given the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, that we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our U.S. denominated results. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings for many fluctuations in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 39% to 44%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 50% to 55% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 49% to 54%. Our guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase in ADRs for Q4 will be less than what we experienced in Q3 for our international hotel service and about the same as Q3 for our U.S. hotels service.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 27% to 32%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 42% to 47%. As I noted last quarter, we will no longer give guidance for operating expenses on a line-by-line basis. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at about the same rate as gross profit, which would result in stable operating leverage with prior year Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $310 million and $330 million, which at the midpoint represents 44% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.90 to $5 per share, which at the midpoint represents 46% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 19%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $513.37 per share.
We expect to report GAAP EPS of $4.23 to $4.33 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, noncash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, noncash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain noncash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to address non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel margin tax, judgments, rulings or settlements.
We are pleased with the top line performance for the business reported in Q3 and inherent in the guidance for Q4. As we have stated on previous calls, considering the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps as we report against prior year periods which had improving economic conditions, hotel occupancy rates and ADRs, we generally expect that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and assumes that our growth rate will decelerate through the remainder of the quarter.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and cancellation rates for our international business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. Our forecast reflects the negative impact observed thus far from recent severe flooding in Thailand, which is a key market for our Agoda business and the Asian business of Booking.com. If the impact of the flooding in Bangkok were to worsen, our forecast would be negatively impacted to a greater extent. We will now take your questions."

In terms of market performance, Tom, we saw strong performance across all of our markets. So the newer markets, being North America for Booking.com, Asia Pacific and South America are still growing at faster rates than our overall consolidated growth rate, but the core markets, Western Europe, Southern Europe continue to post very strong growth for us, and are still a big enough percentage of the total business. But if they were impacted dramatically, you'd notice that in our reported results. In terms of the online advertising, we did have an improvement as a percentage of gross profit versus the prior year. That's principally due to the investments that we made the last couple of quarters. So we were telling you that one of the reasons that the online advertising as a percentage of gross bookings is higher is that our gross bookings were growing at a faster rate, and that those gross bookings would turn into checkouts and revenue, particularly in Q3, which is the seasonal peak for travel for Booking.com. And we saw that happen in Q3. So our gross profit grew at a faster rate than our gross bookings where we had some deceleration, so you see a favorable relationship there. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, and that was partly offset by the mix impact of our international business growing faster than our U.S. business. Internationally, we spend a higher percentage for online advertising than in the U.S. where it's more repeat customers, and we also have our offline advertising program."

There's no good published research for where this number could go. We've seen very significant growth in this number over the past couple of years, which we have reported to you. I think it would be reasonable to expect the growth rate of hotel additions to go down over time. But there's still a lot of opportunity out there. There's a lot of destinations that we're fairly new in. There's a lot of countries where we may have done a good job of developing inventory in the major cities but haven't really gotten out into the smaller villages and towns yet. We have, not only on Booking.com, we have not only hotels, but we also have vacation rentals and bed and breakfast and other types of accommodation, which really opens up development to a much larger number of properties, but those properties would tend to have fewer rooms in them than the larger hotels in the big cities. So those are some of the things to think about when you're looking at that number, and it's also one of the reasons why we really can't give a hard number that this is how many hotels there are in the world, and we'll be satisfied when we have all of them. With respect to mergers and acquisitions, we’ve typically said that we're interested in companies that provide us with new products, new geography, new distribution, in other words, a good brand that has its own customer base that is attractive to us.

Google has launched a products providing vertical search results for both air and hotel. The air is based on the IPA search engine, and the hotel is principally based on content that Google receives, mostly from intermediaries, online travel agents and to a lesser extent, directly from the hotels themselves. Looking at how Google has approached the test of these products, it's clear that they would like to have these platforms operate as efficient vehicle for advertisers to get qualified leads because a customer will have seen more information on Google by the time they click on to an advertising link. And if you look at the hotel product, the online travel agents are very prominently featured in the display. With respect to the flight search, that's not the case. And I believe, although I don't know firsthand, that that's principally because limitations that have been placed on Google by the airlines. However, Google has said, and it appears that they're trying to find opportunities for online travel agents to advertise on the air platform as well. Our approach, as an advertiser on Google, is to try to understand their products the best we can and participate in them as effectively as we can, and that's how we've approached the hotel product in particular. A lot of people are concerned about Google's market power, and whether there could be anything anti-competitive coming out of this and a number of other companies, not including ours by the way, raised comments and criticism of the ITA transaction as part of the anti-trust approval of that transaction. But the transaction was approved.

A number of major industrial parks have been flooded, and people who have been looking at the news have seen primary concern about supply chain for the automotive and tech industries since so much of the manufacturing of components happens in Thailand. The concern was, as the floodwaters move from north to south that they would encroach on Bangkok. And in fact, they have encroached on sections of the city to the north, and it's created a lot of very serious dislocation, human dislocation, people having to move out of their homes and so forth. And there's still a worry that floodwaters might get to the center business district of the city, which would create additional problems. And furthermore, the main international airport in Bangkok remains open. The secondary airport was taken out by floods. If something happened to make the main international airport unavailable, that obviously would pose problems for travel. Even though Thailand is an important tourist destination, a leisure destination for the business of both Agoda and Booking.com in the region, just because of the size and the balance of all the other businesses, the impact to date has not been material to our consolidated results. If that were to worsen, I think it'd be difficult to foresee that being material to our business as a whole, but it certainly could be problematic for our Asian business."

There's been a lot consolidation among the major airlines here in the United States. And one of the consequences of that consolidation is removal of redundant routes and retirement of aircraft and so forth, and I think that's part of it and it's also part and parcel of the airlines' need to keep their fares up, so they have appropriate operating margins. I think most people in the business believe that high airfares and reductions in capacity do have an impact on leisure travel, in particular. And that may generate substitution, although I don't have any data on that. If you look at our business in the United States, it’s been growing at a little bit more than 10% here throughout the course of the year. Certainly, that's higher than the travel space in general. And I think the reason that we're able to do that is because we add new products and improve the website, and launch effective marketing campaigns and are able to drive a little business. But there's no question that higher airfares and less capacity will be a factor for leisure travel demand going forward. With respect to the car rental business, we had, I think, good availability of inventory for all of our businesses around the world in the third quarter. We didn't have a situation where fleet was overly tight and we couldn't get opaque inventory. And we certainly were able to generate enough inventory for significant bookings growth at TravelJigsaw that we mentioned.
