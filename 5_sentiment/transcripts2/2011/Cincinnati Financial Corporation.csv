Our fourth-quarter results were good, the highest quarterly operating income in three years. For the year, we outperformed 2009’s combined ratio",1022,"Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth-quarter and full-year results. Our fourth-quarter results were good, the highest quarterly operating income in three years. For the year, we outperformed 2009’s combined ratio and operating income, covering our shareholder dividend through operating results.
After paying our $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, we grew book value per share $0.11 during the quarter despite a significant decline in bond portfolio valuations for us and others in our industry.
Part of the book value growth was from appreciation of our equity holdings, further demonstrating how our portfolio mix contributes to long-term shareholder value creation. For the year, our value creation ratio was 11.1%. That's within a percentage point of our targeted range for the annual average in any five-year periods.
We believe that several initiatives to improve our insurance profitability and premium growth will drive stronger value creation over the next several quarters. We've increased our shareholder dividend now for 50 consecutive years, and we'll continue working to reward shareholders and other stakeholders for years to come.
Investment income for the fourth-quarter was up 2% compared with the third quarter. Steve will provide more details on that plus portfolio evaluation changes. I'll just note that we expect lower prevailing interest rates to continue pressure investment income trends for us and other companies.
Our relatively higher concentration in stocks means we have additional opportunities for growth of dividend income, an addition to capital appreciation.
Given the pressure on interest income, we recognized the need to continue to execute on strategic initiatives to improve underwriting results and profitably grow our business. We intend to do just that in order to achieve our performance objectives.
We successfully executed our 2010 premium growth initiatives growing net written premiums by 2% after ending 2009 with 3% premium decline. We reached a record high for new business written premiums at $414 million, an increase of $9 million or 2% over 2009.
Personal Lines drove the $9 million increase in new business, contributing $15 million and total net written premiums for Personal Lines grew steadily, ending the year up 9% including 10% in the fourth-quarter.
Personal Lines market conditions have improved, increasing the impact of our initiatives for improved pricing precision, easier to use policy processing technology for our agents and expansion in the new states and agencies.
Targeted rate increases help grow renewal written premiums by 7% for the year. Those increases should continue to improve combined ratios over the next several quarters as the written premium increase is earned.
For our Commercial Lines segment, net written premiums were down 26 million or 1%, which is a nice improvement from the 6% decline in 2009. While we are still seeing commercial renewal pricing declines in the low single-digits, we continue to benefit from entering into new states.
In 2010, net written premiums growth from five states since late 2008 was $29 million. The drag from audit premium returns diminished as the year progressed and the effect was nearly flat by year end. We expect to see positive contributions from audit premiums in future quarters as our general liability and workers’ compensation lines benefit from the recovering economy.
We made very satisfactory progress in developing and delivering several important information technology initiatives. Agents continue to comment favorably on our Commercial Lines policy processing technology
The system now is available in a total of 30 states as we achieved the goal we communicated to you a year ago of deploying to 19 states in 2010. Our excess and surplus lines net written premiums rose 47% to $58 million in 2010.
As the year progress, we saw more standard lines companies running business that was formally in the E&S market. We demonstrated discipline by scaling back on new business, increasing it by only $3 million compared with an $18 million increase the year before. While renewing excess and surplus lines policies we obtained price increases averaging in the low to mid single-digit range.
Our life insurance subsidiary also continued to register growth with earned premiums up 10% and fixed annuity deposit premiums up 11%.
Coming to underwriting results for most of our property casualty lines of business, we maintained a healthy level of profitability. For all lines under the workers' compensation, homeowner and excess and surplus lines, the 2010 combined ratio average 95%.
Net profitable core business represents almost 80% of our property casualty premium volume. On an all lines basis, the 2010 combined ratio improved 2.8 percentage points to 101.7%.
We continue to develop pricing precision tools to keep the healthy lines profitable and to improve the unprofitable ones. We continue to believe the property casualty underwriting performance is our most powerful lever to growing operating earnings.
We are now using predictive modeling tools incorporating pricing analytics to increase pricing precision in our major Personal Lines of businesses after workers' compensation.
We plan to add the remaining major Commercial Lines of business during 2011 and that will support our goal of underwriting each line of business at a profitable level. Existing tools for pricing precision will continue to be improved including further integration into our process existence and workflows.
In late 2010, we implemented another round of significant rate increases for our homeowner lines. We plan similar increases in 2011 to continue moving these lines of profitability as rate increases are earned.
We've previously discussed additional workers' compensation initiatives focusing on claims handing and loss control that we believe are working in approving results to that line of business.
Our excess and surplus lines' 2010 combined ratio improved 40 percentage points and 115.4%. Startup expenses are leveling off and our progress toward the underlining profitability is meeting our expectations.
In summary, we have successfully achieved completion or reached major milestones for several initiatives during the past two years. That builds confidence that we’ll continue to execute our strategy for ongoing profit improvement and growth. You'll hear more in future quarters about new initiatives and our progress on several that are ongoing.
Now, Steve will give you his perspective on results for the fourth-quarter and the year.

The fourth-quarter was profitable with casualty underwriting, life insurance operations and investments, all contributing to strong operating earnings.2010 was noteworthy in that Cincinnati Financial increased our dividend to shareholder",755,"Thank you, Ken. The fourth-quarter was profitable with casualty underwriting, life insurance operations and investments, all contributing to strong operating earnings.
2010 was noteworthy in that Cincinnati Financial increased our dividend to shareholders for the 50th consecutive year. That puts us in an exclusive group with approximately 10 other publicly-traded companies that have a 50-year or longer track record.
The strong fourth-quarter resulted in operating earnings that covered our shareholder dividend both for the quarter and the full-year. Our value creation ratio goal is to average between 12% and 15% annually over a five-year period. For 2010, the VCR was 11.1% and for 2009, it was 19.7%.
The fourth-quarter combined ratio of 93.1% improved the full combined ratio by 2.8 points to 101.7%. Catastrophe losses contributed just 7/10 of the loss ratio point to the quarter and 5.1 points for the full-year.
The full-year underwriting expense ratio was 32.8%, no change from 2009 and slightly better than the estimated range of 33% to 34% target in our first quarter conference call. Property casualty reserves or prior attributes developed very favorably dedicating the fourth-quarter combined ratio by 17.6 points.
For all of 2010 prior accident reserves developed favorably by 10.3 loss ratio points compared with 2009 favorable development of 6.4 points.
Our reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We have a very consistent approach resulting now and in 22 consecutive years of favorable development of prior accident year's reserves.
We continue to target total reserves in the upper half of the actual range and we believe that our shared reserves are in virtually the same position within the actual range at the end of 2010 as they were at the end of 2009.
Nearly, all of the favorable development for accident years 2007 through 2009 with majority of it coming in our commercial casualty line of business.
Our updated loss reserve estimate shows each of these accident years developing favorably by an average of about 7 points. There is no assurance that accident year 2010 will develop similarly, but we can assure that we have been consistent in our reserving practices.
Now for some detail on investments, our diversified approach to investments produced solid results for both the quarter and the year. Pre-tax investment income decreased slightly to $130.1 million for the quarter from $130.9 million a year ago.
For the full-year pre-tax investment income increased $17 million to $518 million. Higher average invested assets due in part to healthy operating cash flow more than offset declining portfolio yields. Unrealized gains before tax for our $3 billion equity portfolio grew 30% during the fourth-quarter to over $750 million.
Considerable attention has been given recently to the health of municipal bond issuers. I’d like to give you a quick profile of our holdings. Our municipal bond portfolio is approximately 63% of shareholders’ equity. It consists of approximately 1,000 securities with 95% rated A, or higher. Approximately two-thirds of the portfolio is general obligation, of which, only $3 million worth are state issued and one-third of the portfolio is in revenue bonds.
Despite the fourth-quarter sell-off, our municipal portfolio was trading at over 103% of book value at year end. Additionally, we have no foreign sovereign debt exposure. As a reminder, our entire portfolio is listed and updated quarterly on our Web site.
Liquidity, the balance sheet and our financial condition continue to strengthen putting us in a solid position to grow profitably. Even after a dividend of $220 million paid to the holding company during 2010, statutory surplus through the property casualty insurance group grew by $129 million to approximately $3.8 billion at year end 2010.
At the holding company level, we continue to have just over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities and our debt to total capital ratio also improved to 14.3%.
Summing everything up, the contributions to book value per share for the quarter are as follows. Property casualty underwriting profits contributed $0.20, life insurance operations added $0.08, investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.47.
The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains from the fixed income portfolios reduced with value per share by $0.99. The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains from the equity portfolio provided growth of $0.75 and we paid to our shareholders $0.40 per share in dividends.
Totaling it all up, book value increased by $0.11 during the fourth-quarter and by $1.66 or 5.7% for the full-year to $30.91 per share.
That concludes my prepared comments, and I'll turn it back over to Ken.

We had 10.4 points of favorable development, 10.4 points on the loss ratio. If you remember a year ago we did some strengthening on workers' comp. If we were to take workers comp out of both years it would have been 10.1 points in favorable development in 2010 and 9.1 points in favorable development in 2009. So I think it's a steady approach.
Commercial casualty led the way this year with about 27 points for the full-year in favorable development. Last year, commercial casualty also led the way with about 22 points of favorable development. I think the key thing to keep in mind is we have a very steady approach here.
Our claims management, some of the things I look at is, one, is the consistency in our claims management. Marty Mullen who just took over 2.5 years ago is only the fourth Head of Claims in the 50 years company history. The senior management in our claims department has over 30 years of experience. The headquarter supervisors have over 20 years of experience on average, and the people in the field average right around 13 years of experience. So, it's a very consistent approach that I don't think would result in changes in claims reporting, patterns or settlement rates, that's one thing I look at it.
Another thing is the position in the actual range. We feel that we are in virtually the same position reserve wide in the actual range at the end of 2010 that we were at the end of 2009, so we feel it's a pretty steady long-term approach to saving reserves.

I think Texas is, as much as anything purely a function of size. The population, we've got 33 locations in Texas now we've appointed. That has been quicker. Two years ago, I probably wouldn't have anticipated perhaps it being that quick we have five territories now, five experienced field reps down there, we'll be adding a sixth territory this upcoming year.
Receptivity in Texas from those agencies has just been excellent. We've done some things pretty aggressively. We placed field claims representatives in the state really before we had any real financial justification to do. We didn't have that many claims, but we wanted to have Cincinnati field claims reps prepared to handle claims from the very beginning of our relationship with our agents there. We have loss control on the ground there.
So, we've ramped up, if you will, our infrastructure, which, for us is our individuals working out of their homes pretty quickly in response to just how responsive the agents were to our model, so, we're pleased with how things have gone there.
Our two territories in Colorado improved this year over the last. We've added a third territory there and are taking the same approach there. We want field claims reps, loss control folks there so that we know what we're writing, and we get great service right from the very beginning. And then our agencies, in an effort to persuade us, not to over-appoint agencies in their area will focus on growing their book of business with our company. So, new states on the drawing board, this year, we hope to see some progress then with the Oregon where we'll have two territories here shortly and then Connecticut. So we’re very pleased with how things have gone in the new states for us and we’ve done nothing special, Cincinnati model all the way.

As far as the case reserving the philosophy it's always been maintained over the 30 years that I’ve been with Cincinnati is first of all, taking the perspective that the majority of our commercial book is in the GL side, close to 50% is on the general liability side. The commercial casualty and then ultimately the umbrella and limits that we write to support our insurers on that umbrella limit.
When we look at claim files from the issues of liability but also take a keen approach to the severity issues that exist in a file, we think it's really important to recognize the severity of the injury and damages at the outset of the case and lay those very heavily in their initial reserving process. That is the safest and the most disciplined way of looking at these large deal cases from a severity perspective.
And I think over the years of our claims staff having the experience in handling those types of cases, they develop positively from a perspective, as the years mature. But there has been no change at all as far as the way we've approached the initial reserving those cases in that general liability line that lead themselves to severity and outlook.

The loss of life and destruction of property caused by a record number of tornadoes, numerous hailstorms and high winds were devastating to families and communities across the United States during the second quarter. While it’s impossible to completely fix the situation, our well-equipped claims professionals gave tremendous effort to settle claims in a prompt, courteous and professional manner and under very difficult circumstances. We handled nearly all of the claims with our own associates.
Over one-third of our field claim staff from various parts of the company left home to perform additional storm duty sometimes more than once to assist in areas hit hard by second quarter catastrophes. And the claims representatives that remained at home worked extra hard to maintain high levels of service in the less affected areas. It was a total team effort and we sincerely thank them.
As an example, their promptness and efficiency was demonstrated by already closing over 80% of more than 21,000 claims from second quarter storms. We are hearing positive reports from our agents and understand that the claims effort is resulting in new business being referred to our agents by satisfied customers. In terms of dollars and cents, the storms clearly hit us where we operate. The record setting catastrophe losses resulted in a second quarter combined ratio of 136.6 in an operating loss. Reflecting on this memorable quarter, our risk management efforts proved effective including prudent use of reinsurance.
Despite incurring the two most costly catastrophe losses in the 60-year history of our company, each with estimated losses before reinsurance that more than doubled our largest prior event Hurricane Ike in 2008. Our shareholders equity and book value per share both increased during the first half of the year. And that was after returning $127 million to shareholders in the form of a cash dividend.
We continue to execute and improve upon our risk management strategies including appropriate use of reinsurance, improved pricing, a diversified investment approach, strong loss reserves and geographic expansion. We reinstated our reinsurance program during the Second Quarter which had the effect of reducing the quarter’s earned premium by approximately $38 million. After the second event, we purchased additional third and fourth event catastrophe cover for the rest of the year. Coverage now attaches at $70 million which means our loss retention level is still relatively low.
Similar to our program in effect at the beginning of the year we retained a share of losses above the attachment point and our share for the third and fourth event catastrophe cover is 15%. The second quarter storms demonstrated the benefits of our reinsurance program as our recovery of losses is now estimated at over $220 million from the April and May storms.
Our diversified investment portfolio contributed gains to the balance sheet and generated higher investment income. Mike Sewell will provide additional investment detail in a couple of minutes. We continue to be confident about the strength of our loss reserves. We maintain a consistent approach and aim to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range which we believe is important for longer term financial performance.
Another positive trend was our premium growth. It was broad based occurring in all three property casualty segments and profitable growth will help increase future earnings more rapidly. We believe there are pricing and improvement initiatives are gaining traction as the effect of higher catastrophes and the associated reinstatement premium more than explains the increase in our second quarter and first half combined ratios.
We continue to rate increases in our personalized segment and our excess and surplus line segment has been able to increase rates for nine consecutive months. While commercialized renewals in total had a net average price decline estimated at 1% approximately 75% of policies were flat or had an increase in our Workers’ Compensation line experienced a solid price increase.
Life insurance earned premiums also grew in the second quarter as did profit. That segment remains an important contributor to operating results and helps smooth out the naturally more variable results from property casualty operations. On May 31st, our new CFO Mike Sewell joined the team and the effects of his contributions are already being felt.
Now Mike will provide some perspective on financial results and our financial position.

I’ll start by highlighting some of the key components of investment performance. Net investment income rose 2% for the second quarter on a pretax basis. For investment portfolio in total, the first half 2011 after tax average yield was down 16 basis points from a year ago and 20 basis points on a pretax basis.
The bond portion of the pretax yield declined by 30 basis points, dividend income from equity securities grew at a double digit pace during the first half of 2011 partially offsetting the decline in the bond portfolio yields. Dividend growth faces a tougher comparison for the second half as you may recall in last year’s third quarter, we completed [inaudible] of holding. [Inaudible] did not pay a dividend in the second half of 2010 dividend income benefited from redeployment proceeds from that sale.
The sum of realized gains plus the change in unrealized investment portfolio gains in the first half of 2011 was 284 million pretax. That total represents a 23% increase over the balance of unrealized gains at the end of 2010 boosting our portfolio’s total return. We ended the quarter with equity securities representing 25.3% of total invested asset fair value, 1.2 percentage points below that measure at the end of March. In part that was due to second quarter bond portfolio gains outpacing our equity portfolio gains.
Our investment approach has not changed. Valuations for our various portfolios in recent quarters have fluctuated at levels within what we consider normal variation.
Moving to insurance operations, let’s take a closer look at the combined ratio components on a consolidated property casualty basis. There are several moving parts to consider. Loss and loss expense reserve development on prior accident years during the first half of 2011 had a favorable effect on our combined ratio by 10.3 percentage points matching the full effect of 2010 ratio effect.
To look at the underlying trends we adjusted to cancel out the effects of catastrophes in the reinstatement premium. On that basis the loss and loss expense ratio for the first six months of accident year 2011 improved 0.2 percentage points compared with accident year 2010 measured as of yearend 2010 and the underlying expense ratio improved 1.0 points.
Controlling expenses remains an important focus throughout the organization. Even as we aim to improve service in selected areas of strategic importance we see the expense ratio benefiting from future growth. We expect to continue realizing policy processing efficiencies over time from our investment and technology along with other process improvements and further deployment of performance metrics.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the first six months of this year was slightly positive but well below last year’s level due to higher paid losses arising mostly from catastrophes. Pay losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance were up 263 million driving our 249 million decline in operating cash flow. We studied various ways to keep fueling investments, steadily supplying our portfolio managers with new cash to invest while also providing for consistent dividends and other corporate needs. We decided in mid-July to tap more of our existing lines of credit for an additional 55 million.
The terms of borrowing are very favorable including a floating interest rate currently just under 60 basis points. If that borrowing had occurred before June 30th the effect of 55 million on our debt to capital capitalization would have raised it modestly to 15.0% compared with the 14.2% we reported.
We ended the second quarter with over one billion in cash and marketable securities at the holding company level and we remain in great shape in terms of capital, liquidity and financial flexibility. The contributions to both value per share for the quarter are as follow property casualty underwriting losses reduced book value by $1.06, the life insurance operations added $0.08, investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.45. The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains from the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.38. The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains from our equity portfolio provided growth of $0.16 and again, we paid $0.40 per share in dividends to shareholders.
In total, book value decreased by $0.39 during the second quarter to $31.01 per share, $0.10 above the year end 2010 level. Adding the $0.40 per share dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter stayed in the positive territory at 0.1%. For the six months of 2011, our value creation ratio was 2.9%. That concludes my prepared comments and I’ll turn it back over to Steve.

I’ll give it a shot and then I’ll turn it over to J.F. to see if he has any additional insights. But in terms of pricing overall, I think on the personalized side we continue to get rate in the homeowner’s area in the upper single digit. After the events of the second quarter we actually went back in some of the states and filed for more additional rate than we had originally planned for this fall. So we feel that we’re getting rate in homeowners and we think our retention is holding up well.
Personal auto, we’re getting rate in the low single digit area so we feel that that is also holding up well as our retention remains high. We are adding the predicted modeling capabilities to personalize now for the third year. So in addition to the rate increases on an average, we’re getting more rate on those risks that we feel need more rate. And we’re also seeing the distribution of our book shift towards the more profitable accounts.
Excess and surplus lines I think has been strong in terms of rate increase. They’re in a tough environment I know because the market is soft. They face competition of E&S riders. Also we here reports of standard companies that they relax their terms and conditions to go after what had previously been E&S business. And through all of that we’ve been able to get rate increase on E&S side now for nine consecutive months.
Moving more into the commercial line segment we are down overall still slightly around 1%. But on most risks, 75% over 75% were either renewing flat or up a little bit. It’s the larger risks that are under pressure and we’re seeing some need to take rate decrease there to hold on to some quality larger risks. And then also in the worker’s comp area, we are getting rate now and we’ve been getting some rate there for some time. J.F. is there anything. I was kind of long winded there, is there anything…?

I think there are some questions relative to property and in particular there have been questions to property increases in the affected areas Steve mentioned in homeowners we’ve been able to refile there. In the commercial lines area just add some color to that. It might stand to reason that because of the significant catastrophes and in the Tuscaloosa area and Joplin area, places like that, that property increases would be quick and easy to get.
The psychology that we experienced there though is that the policy holders in those areas are still if you will traumatized by what happened to them. They are in many cases, a lot of the property that we insure or they have insured isn’t fixed yet or having difficulties getting contractors to take care of a lot of that type of thing. So the psychology of going back to those people right now and in effect saying that we have another property loss for you in the form of an additional premium or increased rates in property isn’t as easy as you might think.
However, having said that, I think that’s temporary in the sense that once the trauma is passed, once people are back on their feet, everyone will expect that rates will go up and we think we’ll be able to get those rates as the months go on.

We see in terms of the quarter, we see the quarter as an income statement event. It hit our income statement hard. The balance sheet though remained largely unscathed.

And we have been successful in all of the new states where we’ve entered.

We continue to write about 85% casualty lines, 15% property. We have added some miscellaneous professional lines to the business. We don’t really feel that we need to expand our appetite aggressively. We have a lot of opportunity within our current agency force to write the E&S business they currently write.
One of the things that we are beginning to do is add field underwriters to our marketing efforts and underwriting efforts for the E&S business. Up to this point, all the ENS business would have funneled in here to headquarters. After having first gone through our standard market field reps, it would come in here for under writing and pricing.
We have individuals who we believe are capable that are now going to move out into the field, call on agencies in person, just as that model has worked beautifully for us on the standard side, we think that will help us continue to write business in our agencies without any aggressive increase in our appetite. Our agencies write somewhere around $2 billion in excess and surplus lines business.
If you were to eliminate half of it as business that would not fit our appetite, we have an opportunity to write a billion dollars with a model that is pretty attractive. And so we think the balance of casualty to property is about where it will be. I think it’s worth mentioning that we’re not trying to write this in big chunks. Our average premium this year is just a little over $4,800. The medium size policy we issued in CSU our excess and surplus line company was just a little over $2,100. So we’re very much a special events conservative writer. Some agencies because they’re pretty comfortable with us, are working real hard at moving a lot of the business our way.

So it’s only appointed Cincinnati insurance agents that write through us. I think it’s worth mentioning also that the premium and losses from excess and surplus lines business is included in or co-mingled with the premiums and losses with their standard business for purposes of the profit sharing we offer to our agencies.
So in addition to the incentive of writing business with us because there is no middle person involved, because our field claims reps will handle claims because our loss control reps will provide lost control services where none is available in the standard excess and surplus lines marketplace. The agency also has an opportunity to earn profit on that business which is an incentive for them not to put poor excess and surplus lines business with us but to be more careful and thoughtful about the business they send our way.
So we think we have a fine model. We do business only with the agencies with whom we have a relationship and we have good knowledge. And so having said that and given the opportunity that exists within our own agencies, we think we can keep our appetite about where it is and grow nicely.

We have many property and casualty agencies as they grow larger, as they see particularly with the soft market on the property and casualty side they’ve been much more open to other revenue strings. They’re putting life insurance specialists in their agencies. Frankly we have good luck with general agencies. Life only shops in the communities in which we operate as well. About 70% of our premiums come from property and casualty distribution the balance from life only distribution. So we have many initiatives in place in try to bolster the life company’s activities. We probably see a fair amount more agency appointments in that area and a bit more cross selling.

It’s no surprise after our recent catastrophe loss announcement that our earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of this year were weak. We see evidence that our initiatives for improving profitability are working and I’ll highlight some of the key indicators.
First and foremost, pricing continues to improve. Specifically, third quarter increases and average renewal pricing occurred in each property casualty segment in total and also for most lines of business within segments. For our commercial lines segment, renewal pricing moved into positive territory. Nearly three quarters of our commercial lines renewing policies had flat or higher pricing compared with the premium for the expiring term.
In our excess and surplus line segment, we have experienced renewal price increases for 13 constitutive months and the rate of increase progress during the quarter to a mid single-digit range. For our September excess and surplus lines renewals, approximately 90% of policies experience price increases.
For personal lines, we are beginning our third conservative year of higher home rental rates. On average, in the high single digit range and our personal auto rate changes also continued to be positive. Our level of commercial and personal pricing position continues to improve with the more thinly price risks getting significantly higher pricing.
Importantly, our agents also tell us that recently they have been able more able to sell pricing increases and that our improved pricing position is a key factor along with some benefit from broad market trends.
Our third quarter and nine month combined ratios are unsatisfactory. Yet, looking beyond the more unusual items, we find validation for our analysis that our pricing improvements are starting to translate into improved underwriting profitability. On the calendar year basis, the nine month combined ratio before catastrophes improved by three tens of a point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property, catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis, the loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses also improved after factoring out the reinstatement premiums and inherent variability of large losses.
We also remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent, aiming to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range, and we believe that is important for longer term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years through three quarters this year continues to trend fairly consistently with our experience during full year 2010.
Another positive we see, is targeted premium growth, resin premium growth again occurred across all segments, including life insurance. For our property casualty operations, agency new business is up 9% for the year, reflecting strong contributions from new agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011. Our goal is to selectively appoint 120 of the best property casualty agencies this year and areas we consider underserved. And we are all well on our way to reaching that goal by achieving 84% in the first nine months. We aim to grow selectively and profitably helping to pure growth in earnings.
Excellent service particularly at the point of sale and at the time of our claim continues to be our best form of advertising. Our team of field claim associates has been a vital part of great service delivery and they have closed 90% of more than 30,000 claims this year that has stem from whether related catastrophes.
We continue to execute risk management strategies, that we believe protect capital and put us in the position to profitably grow the company. One strategy worth highlighting at this time is our reinsurance program which strongly benefiting capital in earnings during this record you of storm losses. As we prepared to work with reinsurers to construct our 2012 reinsurance program, we believe we will successfully balance the risk related benefits and costs. As in the past we will consider data from internal and external models, including the AIR and RMS version 11’ as well as other company information to evaluate various potential changes to our reinsurance treaties in alternative structures. We believe our long-term relationships with our reinsurers and use of multiple data points to estimate risk will help us to effectively shape our 2012 program.
I’ll now to the call over to Chief financial Officer, Mike Sewell for his comments on results during the quarter in our capital position.

My comments will focus on investment performance, expense management and several capital related items. Net investment income rose 2% for the third quarter on a pre-tax basis, bond interest was up 3%, as the higher bond portfolio base offset declining yields. We have expanded the tabular [ph] disclosure in our Form 10-Q that shows that on a nine months basis, our bond portfolio pre-tax yield is 30 basis points lower than a year ago. Dividend income for the third quarter was down slightly, while it grew 5% on a year-to-date basis. In any given quarter, dividend income can vary based on the timing of dividend declarations or ex-dividend dates or due to timing of security sales in reinvestment of proceeds.
It was a rough quarter in terms of common stock market swings. Despite outperforming, the S&P 500 and Index, our equity portfolio fair value ended the quarter down 12% from its level at the end of June. Our bond portfolio had a nice gain in fair value during the quarter up 2%. Evaluations for our equity and bond portfolios in recent quarters have fluctuated of levels within what we consider normal variation and our investment approach remains consistent. Another consistent aspect of our culture, is careful expense management and we continue to invest more resources where it makes business sets including in the areas of field service, technology and data analytics.
Our property casualty expense ratio for the first nine months of 2011 improved by 90 basis points to 32.2%. We see the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future paying premium growth. We also expect to continue realizing policy processing efficiencies over time. As we leverage technology investments and further deploy performance metrics.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the first nine months of this year at $148 million was less than a half the amount of the same period a year ago. That reflected highly paid loss and loss expenses, which were up $321 million net of reinsurance, mostly due to elevated level of catastrophes this year. The relatively low level of cash flow puts added pressure on investment income for us and other companies in our industry.
On the other hand, the industry wide nature of this pressure may help our efforts in sustaining rate increase for our property casualty insurers segments.
During the month of August, we also repurchased over $1 million of our shares for approximately $30 million. The average price we paid was 17% less than the average daily closing price for the first seven months of this year. The repurchase was funded principally through a July borrowing are one of our lines of credit. The terms for borrowing are very favorable including a floating interest rate currently under 1%. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at September 30 was 15.7% well below the 20% upper end of our target range. We ended the third quarter with excellent liquidity totaling nearly $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the holding company level.
On January 1, 2012, we will be required to adopt a new accounting standard related to deferred policy acquisition cost, commonly refer to as DAC, which will have a negative effect on shareholders' equity. We have developed a preliminary estimate but this effect will be less than 1% of the September 30th shareholder’s equity and we anticipate using the retrospective approach upon adoption. Our capital remains strong and well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
Last week, Moody’s Investor Service has performed our A1 financial strength ratings sighting our strong regional franchise, solid risk-adjusted capital position, consistent reserve strength, strong financial flexibility and significant holding company liquidity. Moody’s outlook is negative on concerns about high weather-related losses and weak operating profitability. We share those concerns, but our outlook is decidedly positive. We are confident we can bill build on the progress like our third quarter and nine-month loss ratio improvements and workers compensation and profitability of our excess and surplus lines operation.
I’ll wrap up my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. Property causality underwriting losses reduced book value by $0.32. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance has reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.43. The change in unrealized gains at 9.30, September 30th, plus realized capital gains from fixed-income portfolio increased interest book value per share at $0.31.
The change in unrealized gains at September 30th plus realized capital gains from the equity portfolio reduced book value by $1.53 or nearly 5%. And we paid $0.40 in one quarter per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was the book value decrease of a $1.47 during the third quarter to $29.54 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was negative 3.4%. While, that is clearly not the kind of result we want over the long-term, short term movements in the equity market can cause variability and our strong capital allows us to observe that during any given quarter.
That concludes my prepared comments, and I will turn it back over to Steve.

I think - we think a lot here about all our rate increases keeping pace with loss cost inflation. We discussed a lot internally and it’s really not that simple question, because we’re not taking uniform rate changes across all of our policies, which makes a situation more dynamic one. We’re taking more increases on the policies, we think have the highest expectation for loss and less increase on the policies with the lowest expectation for loss. So in addition to getting more rate. We think we’re changing the distribution of risk towards the last risky policies. And this shifting of the distribution has a favorable impact on the loss constraint. And our other initiatives such as, how the way we’re handling claims, loss control, risk inspection underwriting, we believe that’s also having the favorable impact on our loss cost inflation. So I think what we consider on this, the answer is yes, that we believe that the rate changes we’re putting in right now today will keep pace with our estimate of loss contemplation. And maybe I’ll turn it over to J. F. in terms of a little bit more color on that.

Mike, I’ll just make a little bit more color. I think, one other things in terms of the atmosphere we’re dealing with is that, as Steve mentioned in his opening comments that our agents are responding to us that they are better prepared to deliver rate increases. And that’s a bit of a shift, over the last three or four months, I think the industry in particular Cincinnati insurance with the help of our predicted modeling - integrated predicted modeling. We’ve seen agencies, be more receptive. A good example of what Steve just mentioned would be introduction of our property, liability and auto predicted models. We selected a sample of what we consider to be the most underpriced policies and which represented 3% of our policies. The loss ratio, the historical loss ratio on those policies was 116%. The 97% non-included in that group the historical loss ratio is 50%. And then to add more granularity, of the 3% of the policies that have the 116%, 30% of those accounts are loss free. So the approach that we’re taking is to identify the policies at good model and our experience tells us, we need the most rate and in a somewhat surgical approach, go to our agencies, identify those accounts that we need to be underpriced and take aggressive action.
Price is an important lever, that to pull that as Steve mentioned a lot of the other initiatives that we’re in the middle of that, that we think are going to help us, are going to improve the loss ratio as well. He mentioned in claims and I’m sorry to give long wind [ph] about it, but I think this tells a bigger story. And then on workers comp claims we have a call center now, were claims are called in directly to the company. We’ve reduced in two years, less than two years the number of days between the date of loss and the date of report from 8 to 4. That’s a significant improvement that reduces our cost. We have more claims - workers claims specialist out on the field, our medical bill rate pricing is taking hold, loss control department has grown from 54 individuals to 69, so there are variety of thing that we are doing. Price being one of the important ones that we think we’re going to continue to improve the loss ratio.

It’s no surprise after our recent catastrophe loss announcement that our earnings for the third quarter and first 9 months of this year were weak. We see evidence that our initiatives for improving profitability are working and I’ll highlight some of the key indicators.
First and foremost, pricing continues to improve. Specifically, third quarter increases and average renewal pricing occurred in each property casualty segment in total and also for most lines of business within segments. For our commercial lines segment, renewal pricing moved into positive territory. Nearly 3 quarters of our commercial lines renewing policies had flat or higher pricing compared with the premium for the expiring term.
In our excess and surplus line segment, we have experienced renewal price increases for 13 constitutive months and the rate of increase progress during the quarter to a mid single-digit range. For our September excess and surplus lines renewals, approximately 90% of policies experience price increases.
For personal lines, we are beginning our third conservative year of higher home rental rates. On average, in the high single digit range and our personal auto rate changes also continued to be positive. Our level of commercial and personal pricing position continues to improve with the more thinly price risks getting significantly higher pricing.
Importantly, our agents also tell us that recently they have been able more able to sell pricing increases, and that our improved pricing position is a key factor along with some benefit from broad market trends.
Our third quarter and 9 month combined ratios are unsatisfactory. Yet, looking beyond the more unusual items, we find validation for our analysis that our pricing improvements are starting to translate into improved underwriting profitability. On the calendar year basis, the 9-month combined ratio before catastrophes improved by .3 of a point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property, catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis, the loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses also improved after factoring out the reinstatement premiums and inherent variability of large losses.
We also remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent, aiming to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range, and we believe that is important for longer term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years through three quarters this year continues to trend fairly consistently with our experience during full year 2010.
Another positive we see, is targeted premium growth, resin premium growth again occurred across all segments, including life insurance. For our property casualty operations, agency new business is up 9% for the year, reflecting strong contributions from new agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011. Our goal is to selectively appoint 120 of the best property casualty agencies this year and areas we consider underserved. And we are all well on our way to reaching that goal by achieving 84% in the first nine months. We aim to grow selectively and profitably helping to pure growth in earnings.
Excellent service particularly at the point of sale, and at the time of our claim, continues to be our best form of advertising. Our team of field claim associates has been a vital part of great service delivery and they have closed 90% of more than 30,000 claims this year that has stem from whether related catastrophes.
We continue to execute risk management strategies, that we believe protect capital and put us in the position to profitably grow the company. One strategy worth highlighting at this time is our reinsurance program which strongly benefiting capital in earnings during this record you of storm losses. As we prepared to work with reinsurers to construct our 2012 reinsurance program, we believe we will successfully balance the risk related benefits and costs. As in the past we will consider data from internal and external models, including the AIR and RMS version 11’ as well as other company information to evaluate various potential changes to our reinsurance treaties in alternative structures. We believe our long-term relationships with our reinsurers and use of multiple data points to estimate risk will help us to effectively shape our 2012 program.
I’ll now to the call over to Chief financial Officer, Mike Sewell for his comments on results during the quarter in our capital position."

Net investment income rose 2% for the third quarter on a pre-tax basis, bond interest was up 3%, as the higher bond portfolio base offset declining yie",855,"My comments will focus on investment performance, expense management and several capital related items. Net investment income rose 2% for the third quarter on a pre-tax basis, bond interest was up 3%, as the higher bond portfolio base offset declining yields. We have expanded the tabular [ph] disclosure in our Form 10-Q that shows that on a nine months basis, our bond portfolio pre-tax yield is 30 basis points lower than a year ago. Dividend income for the third quarter was down slightly, while it grew 5% on a year-to-date basis. In any given quarter, dividend income can vary based on the timing of dividend declarations or ex-dividend dates or due to timing of security sales in reinvestment of proceeds.
It was a rough quarter in terms of common stock market swings. Despite outperforming, the S&P 500 and Index, our equity portfolio fair value ended the quarter down 12% from its level at the end of June. Our bond portfolio had a nice gain in fair value during the quarter up 2%. Evaluations for our equity and bond portfolios in recent quarters have fluctuated of levels within what we consider normal variation and our investment approach remains consistent. Another consistent aspect of our culture, is careful expense management and we continue to invest more resources where it makes business sets including in the areas of field service, technology and data analytics.
Our property casualty expense ratio for the first nine months of 2011 improved by 90 basis points to 32.2%. We see the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future paying premium growth. We also expect to continue realizing policy processing efficiencies over time. As we leverage technology investments and further deploy performance metrics.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the first 9 months of this year at $148 million was less than a half the amount of the same period a year ago. That reflected highly paid loss and loss expenses, which were up $321 million net of reinsurance, mostly due to elevated level of catastrophes this year. The relatively low level of cash flow puts added pressure on investment income for us and other companies in our industry.
On the other hand, the industry-wide nature of this pressure may help our efforts in sustaining rate increase for our property casualty insurers segments.
During the month of August, we also repurchased over $1 million of our shares for approximately $30 million. The average price we paid was 17% less than the average daily closing price for the first 7 months of this year. The repurchase was funded principally through a July borrowing are one of our lines of credit. The terms for borrowing are very favorable including a floating interest rate currently under 1%. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at September 30 was 15.7% well below the 20% upper end of our target range. We ended the third quarter with excellent liquidity totaling nearly $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the holding company level.
On January 1, 2012, we will be required to adopt a new accounting standard related to deferred policy acquisition cost, commonly refer to as DAC, which will have a negative effect on shareholders' equity. We have developed a preliminary estimate but this effect will be less than 1% of the September 30th shareholder’s equity and we anticipate using the retrospective approach upon adoption. Our capital remains strong and well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
Last week, Moody’s Investor Service has performed our A1 financial strength ratings sighting our strong regional franchise, solid risk-adjusted capital position, consistent reserve strength, strong financial flexibility and significant holding company liquidity. Moody’s outlook is negative on concerns about high weather-related losses and weak operating profitability. We share those concerns, but our outlook is decidedly positive. We are confident we can bill build on the progress like our third quarter and 9-month loss ratio improvements and workers compensation and profitability of our excess and surplus lines operation.
I’ll wrap up my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. Property causality underwriting losses reduced book value by $0.32. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance has reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.43. The change in unrealized gains at 9.30, September 30th, plus realized capital gains from fixed-income portfolio increased interest book value per share at $0.31.
The change in unrealized gains at September 30th plus realized capital gains from the equity portfolio reduced book value by $1.53 or nearly 5%. And we paid $0.40 in one quarter per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was the book value decrease of a $1.47 during the third quarter to $29.54 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was negative 3.4%. While, that is clearly not the kind of result we want over the long-term, short term movements in the equity market can cause variability and our strong capital allows us to observe that during any given quarter.
That concludes my prepared comments, and I will turn it back over to Steve."

I think - we think a lot here about all our rate increases keeping pace with loss cost inflation. We discussed a lot internally and it’s really not that simple question, because we’re not taking uniform rate changes across all of our policies, which makes a situation more dynamic one. We’re taking more increases on the policies, we think have the highest expectation for loss and less increase on the policies with the lowest expectation for loss. So in addition to getting more rate. We think we’re changing the distribution of risk towards the last risky policies. And this shifting of the distribution has a favorable impact on the loss constraint. And our other initiatives such as, how the way we’re handling claims, loss control, risk inspection underwriting, we believe that’s also having the favorable impact on our loss cost inflation. So I think what we consider on this, the answer is yes, that we believe that the rate changes we’re putting in right now today will keep pace with our estimate of loss contemplation. And maybe I’ll turn it over to J. F., in terms of a little bit of more color on that."

Mike, I’ll just make a little bit more color. I think, one other things in terms of the atmosphere we’re dealing with is that, as Steve mentioned in his opening comments that our agents are responding to us that they are better prepared to deliver rate increases. And that’s a bit of a shift, over the last 3 or 4 months, I think the industry in particular Cincinnati insurance with the help of our predicted modeling -- integrated predicted modeling. We’ve seen agencies, be more receptive. A good example of what Steve just mentioned would be introduction of our property, liability and auto predicted models. We selected a sample of what we consider to be the most underpriced policies and which represented 3% of our policies. The loss ratio, the historical loss ratio on those policies was 116%. The 97% non-included in that group the historical loss ratio is 50%. And then to add more granularity, of the 3% of the policies that have the 116%, 30% of those accounts are loss free. So the approach that we’re taking is to identify the policies at good model and our experience tells us, we need the most rate and in a somewhat surgical approach, go to our agencies, identify those accounts that we need to be underpriced and take aggressive action.
Price is an important lever, that to pull that as Steve mentioned a lot of the other initiatives that we’re in the middle of that, that we think are going to help us, are going to improve the loss ratio as well. He mentioned in claims and I’m sorry to give long-winded [ph] about it, but I think this tells a bigger story. And then on workers comp claims we have a call center now, were claims are called in directly to the company. We’ve reduced in two years, less than 2 years the number of days between the date of loss and the date of report from 8 to 4. That’s a significant improvement that reduces our cost. We have more claims -- workers claims specialist out on the field, our medical bill rate pricing is taking hold, loss control department has grown from 54 individuals to 69, so there are variety of thing that we are doing. Price being one of the important ones that we think we’re going to continue to improve the loss ratio."

It’s no surprise after our recent catastrophe loss announcement that our earnings for the third quarter and first 9 months of this year were weak.

It’s no surprise after our recent catastrophe loss announcement that our earnings for the third quarter and first 9 months of this year were weak. We see evidence that our initiatives for improving profitability are working and I’ll highlight some of the key indicators.
First and foremost, pricing continues to improve. Specifically, third quarter increases and average renewal pricing occurred in each property casualty segment in total and also for most lines of business within segments. For our commercial lines segment, renewal pricing moved into positive territory. Nearly 3 quarters of our commercial lines renewing policies had flat or higher pricing compared with the premium for the expiring term.
In our excess and surplus line segment, we have experienced renewal price increases for 13 constitutive months and the rate of increase progress during the quarter to a mid single-digit range. For our September excess and surplus lines renewals, approximately 90% of policies experience price increases.
For personal lines, we are beginning our third conservative year of higher home rental rates. On average, in the high single digit range and our personal auto rate changes also continued to be positive. Our level of commercial and personal pricing position continues to improve with the more thinly price risks getting significantly higher pricing.
Importantly, our agents also tell us that recently they have been able more able to sell pricing increases, and that our improved pricing position is a key factor along with some benefit from broad market trends.
Our third quarter and 9 month combined ratios are unsatisfactory. Yet, looking beyond the more unusual items, we find validation for our analysis that our pricing improvements are starting to translate into improved underwriting profitability. On the calendar year basis, the 9-month combined ratio before catastrophes improved by 0.3 points. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property, catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis, the loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses also improved after factoring out the reinstatement premiums and inherent variability of large losses.
We also remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent, aiming to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range, and we believe that is important for longer term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years through three quarters this year continues to trend fairly consistently with our experience during full year 2010.
Another positive we see, is targeted premium growth, resin premium growth again occurred across all segments, including life insurance. For our property casualty operations, agency new business is up 9% for the year, reflecting strong contributions from new agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011. Our goal is to selectively appoint 120 of the best property casualty agencies this year and areas we consider underserved. And we are all well on our way to reaching that goal by achieving 84% in the first nine months. We aim to grow selectively and profitably helping to pure growth in earnings.
Excellent service particularly at the point of sale, and at the time of our claim, continues to be our best form of advertising. Our team of field claim associates has been a vital part of great service delivery and they have closed 90% of more than 30,000 claims this year that has stem from whether related catastrophes.
We continue to execute risk management strategies, that we believe protect capital and put us in the position to profitably grow the company. One strategy worth highlighting at this time is our reinsurance program which strongly benefiting capital in earnings during this record year of storm losses. As we prepared to work with reinsurers to construct our 2012 reinsurance program, we believe we will successfully balance the risk related benefits and costs. As in the past we will consider data from internal and external models, including the AIR and RMS version 11’ as well as other company information to evaluate various potential changes to our reinsurance treaties in alternative structures. We believe our long-term relationships with our reinsurers and use of multiple data points to estimate risk will help us to effectively shape our 2012 program.
I’ll now to the call over to Chief financial Officer, Mike Sewell for his comments on results during the quarter in our capital position."

Net investment income rose 2% for the third quarter on a pre-tax basis, bond interest was up 3%, as the higher bond portfolio base offset declining yields. We have expanded the tabular [ph] disclosure in our Form 10-Q that shows that on a nine months basis, our bond portfolio pre-tax yield is 30 basis points lower than a year ago. Dividend income for the third quarter was down slightly, while it grew 5% on a year-to-date basis. In any given quarter, dividend income can vary based on the timing of dividend declarations or ex-dividend dates or due to timing of security sales in reinvestment of proceeds.
It was a rough quarter in terms of common stock market swings. Despite outperforming, the S&P 500 and Index, our equity portfolio fair value ended the quarter down 12% from its level at the end of June. Our bond portfolio had a nice gain in fair value during the quarter up 2%. Evaluations for our equity and bond portfolios in recent quarters have fluctuated of levels within what we consider normal variation and our investment approach remains consistent. Another consistent aspect of our culture, is careful expense management and we continue to invest more resources where it makes business sets including in the areas of field service, technology and data analytics.
Our property casualty expense ratio for the first nine months of 2011 improved by 90 basis points to 32.2%. We see the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future paying premium growth. We also expect to continue realizing policy processing efficiencies over time. As we leverage technology investments and further deploy performance metrics.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the first 9 months of this year at $148 million was less than a half the amount of the same period a year ago. That reflected highly paid loss and loss expenses, which were up $321 million net of reinsurance, mostly due to elevated level of catastrophes this year. The relatively low level of cash flow puts added pressure on investment income for us and other companies in our industry.
On the other hand, the industry-wide nature of this pressure may help our efforts in sustaining rate increase for our property casualty insurers segments.
During the month of August, we also repurchased over $1 million of our shares for approximately $30 million. The average price we paid was 17% less than the average daily closing price for the first 7 months of this year. The repurchase was funded principally through a July borrowing are one of our lines of credit. The terms for borrowing are very favorable including a floating interest rate currently under 1%. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at September 30 was 15.7% well below the 20% upper end of our target range. We ended the third quarter with excellent liquidity totaling nearly $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the holding company level.
On January 1, 2012, we will be required to adopt a new accounting standard related to deferred policy acquisition cost, commonly refer to as DAC, which will have a negative effect on shareholders' equity. We have developed a preliminary estimate but this effect will be less than 1% of the September 30th shareholder’s equity and we anticipate using the retrospective approach upon adoption. Our capital remains strong and well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
Last week, Moody’s Investor Service has performed our A1 financial strength ratings sighting our strong regional franchise, solid risk-adjusted capital position, consistent reserve strength, strong financial flexibility and significant holding company liquidity. Moody’s outlook is negative on concerns about high weather-related losses and weak operating profitability. We share those concerns, but our outlook is decidedly positive. We are confident we can bill build on the progress like our third quarter and 9-month loss ratio improvements and workers compensation and profitability of our excess and surplus lines operation.
I’ll wrap up my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. Property causality underwriting losses reduced book value by $0.32. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance has reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.43. The change in unrealized gains at 9.30, September 30th, plus realized capital gains from fixed-income portfolio increased interest book value per share at $0.31.
The change in unrealized gains at September 30th plus realized capital gains from the equity portfolio reduced book value by $1.53 or nearly 5%. And we paid $0.40 in one quarter per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was the book value decrease of a $1.47 during the third quarter to $29.54 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was negative 3.4%. While, that is clearly not the kind of result we want over the long-term, short term movements in the equity market can cause variability and our strong capital allows us to observe that during any given quarter.
That concludes my prepared comments, and I will turn it back over to Steve."

I think - we think a lot here about all our rate increases keeping pace with loss cost inflation. We discussed a lot internally and it’s really not that simple question, because we’re not taking uniform rate changes across all of our policies, which makes a situation more dynamic one. We’re taking more increases on the policies, we think have the highest expectation for loss and less increase on the policies with the lowest expectation for loss. So in addition to getting more rate, we think we’re changing the distribution of risk towards the last risky policies. And this shifting of the distribution has a favorable impact on the loss constraint. And our other initiatives such as, how the way we’re handling claims, loss control, risk inspection underwriting, we believe that’s also having the favorable impact on our loss cost inflation. So I think what we consider on this, the answer is yes, that we believe that the rate changes we’re putting in right now today will keep pace with our estimate of loss contemplation. And maybe I’ll turn it over to J. F., in terms of a little bit of more color on that."

I think, one other things in terms of the atmosphere we’re dealing with is that, as Steve mentioned in his opening comments that our agents are responding to us that they are better prepared to deliver rate increases. And that’s a bit of a shift, over the last 3 or 4 months, I think the industry in particular Cincinnati insurance with the help of our predicted modeling -- integrated predicted modeling. We’ve seen agencies, be more receptive. A good example of what Steve just mentioned would be introduction of our property, liability and auto predicted models. We selected a sample of what we consider to be the most underpriced policies and which represented 3% of our policies. The loss ratio, the historical loss ratio on those policies was 116%. The 97% non-included in that group the historical loss ratio is 50%. And then to add more granularity, of the 3% of the policies that have the 116%, 30% of those accounts are loss free. So the approach that we’re taking is to identify the policies at good model and our experience tells us, we need the most rate and in a somewhat surgical approach, go to our agencies, identify those accounts that we need to be underpriced and take aggressive action.
Price is an important lever, that to pull that as Steve mentioned a lot of the other initiatives that we’re in the middle of that, that we think are going to help us, are going to improve the loss ratio as well. He mentioned in claims and I’m sorry to give long-winded [ph] about it, but I think this tells a bigger story. And then on workers comp claims we have a call center now, were claims are called in directly to the company. We’ve reduced in two years, less than 2 years the number of days between the date of loss and the date of report from 8 to 4. That’s a significant improvement that reduces our cost. We have more claims -- workers claims specialist out on the field, our medical bill rate pricing is taking hold, loss control department has grown from 54 individuals to 69, so there are variety of things that we are doing. Price being one of the important ones that we think we’re going to continue to improve the loss ratio."

We did introduce early in the third quarter, right in the second quarter, we predicted modeling and pricing guidance in our casualty property and auto lines.
