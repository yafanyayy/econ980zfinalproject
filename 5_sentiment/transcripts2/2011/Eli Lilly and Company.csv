Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly Company's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Limburg; and Ronika Pletcher; and Gail from Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Form 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
We accomplished a great deal in 2010 while rapidly adapting to significant external and internal challenges. Here are some highlights.  For the full year, we again delivered strong financial performance, generating 6% revenue growth and we were able to leverage the 6% revenue growth into 8% non-GAAP net income growth as we made substantial progress reducing headcount and containing costs.
Our strong operating performance, along with prudent management of working capital generated nearly $7 billion of operating cash flow, easily covering capital expenditures of about $700 million, and our dividend of roughly $2.2 billion.
During the year, we did experience pipeline disappointments and to. However, our scientists remain focused on speeding innovation to patients, making significant pipeline progress. Advancing 16 new molecules into Phase I testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules into Phase III testing.
We also concluded a number of business development with a biased towards those that provide current or potential near-term revenues.
Our strong financial performance, focus on speeding innovation to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully navigating our upcoming patent explorations and emerging with an even greater strength and capacity to drive future growth.
Since our last earnings call, we've made significant progress on a number of fronts. In clinical news, we began Phase III trials of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Based on an interim review of long-term safety data, and after complication with the FDA, we made the decision to begin Phase III trials later this year of md three monotherapy treatment for schizophrenia. And along with our partner Insights Pharmaceuticals we disclosed promising Phase IIa data in rheumatoid arthritis for our jack one jack two inhibitor.
In regulatory news, we received FDA approval of Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Based on its clinical trials in patients with chronic back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. And we'll begin active promotion for this syndication next week.
We also received FDA approval for Ask as replacement therapy e-mails for conditions so see with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. And we expect to launch the product midyear after building sufficient launch quantities.
Health Canada approved Ada to improve glycemic control in patients with type two diabetes and we also submitted SMDAs for by Ada used in combination with basal insulin and for sial us for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
On the legal front, the U.S. Mr. Corporate mold ruled that judgment will be in Lily's favor to do something patent challenge. Including our recently updated six-month pediatric exclusivity, this patent provides protection for lift until January 17. In the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard our appeal for the U.S. District Court's ruling in validating our Strattera method of use patent. As argued at the appeal hearing, we feel there is a strong basis for the CAFC to overturn the district court ruling. We are awaiting a decision by the CAFC and in the meantime an injunction from the CAFC provides generics from launching.
Finally in business development news, we announced and completed the acquisition of Abbott Radiopharmaceuticals. Abbott's lead asset for the. Was assigned for priority review by the FDA and just last week an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta amyloid imaging agent if certain conditions are met related to physician training and re-reading of existing brain scans.
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we draw strategic alliance with commercial alliance two oral diabetes compounds from DBI and to basal analogue insulins from Lily. As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe brought insights to some underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
On Slide 7, you can see the revenue grew 4% in Q4 to nearly $6.2 billion. As I'll show more detail in a minute, volume continued to be the major driver of our revenue growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points from 75.9% to 80.1%. Roughly 2/3 of this increase was due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventory sold. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar substantially increased cost of sales in Q4 2009 but slightly decreased cost of sales in Q4 2010. The remaining improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue was due to lower manufacturing costs, a tangible result of our ongoing productivity improvement efforts.
This quarter's total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew 8%. Within operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 2% as higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative expenses and a company-wide cost containment efforts. R&D expense on the other hand grew 18%. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was due to higher than normal charges related to business development committees and terminations determination of clinical trials. Other income and deductions improved due to primarily to lower miscellaneous other expense and to a lesser extent, lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate fell by four percentage points largely due to the recognition in Q4 of the full year impact of the extension of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share increased 24% in 22% respectively.
For the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and net income as revenue grew 6% while net income grew 8%. We achieved this leverage between revenue and net income despite foreign exchange being a drag on our gross margin percent for the full year, higher than normal charges flowing through R&D in 2010 and a 1.6 percentage point increase in the full year tax rate largely due to the $85 million tax charge taken in Q1, 2010 as a result of U.S. healthcare reform.
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported in non-GAAP earnings per share. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
As you can see on Slide 10, for both the fourth quarter and the full year, foreign exchange had little effect on revenue growth as a weaker euro was offset by strength in other foreign currencies including the Japanese yen.
Consequently, performance growth and total revenue of 5% for both the quarter and the year was driven by 3% volume growth and a favorable 2% impact from price. In both periods, we saw robust double-digit volume growth in our Japanese chemo Pharmaceutical business and our global animal health business. Now, let's look at the rest of the income statement.
Slide 11 shows the year on year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement with and without the effective changes of foreign exchange rate. The numbers in the first column by the same as those you saw earlier on our non-GAAP income statement. If you look at the top of the second column of numbers, you'll see the 5% performance growth in revenue I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see the cost of sales actually decreased 2% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. As a result, gross margin grew 7%. Operating expenses grew faster than revenue this quarter. The larger than normal R&D charge is mentioned earlier drove the majority of the 9% performance growth in operating expenses. As a result of this increase in operating expenses, our 5% performance growth in revenue translated into 3% performance growth in operating income while the lower tax rate this quarter boosted growth in EPS to 10%.
Finally, you'll see that in the last column and for the year, we've leveraged 5% performance growth in revenue to 7% and 8% growth in operating income and earnings per share respectively. We achieved this leverage due primarily to lower manufacturing costs. For your information, Slide 12, we provided the year on year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Next, I'll briefly cover some highlights from our quarterly pipeline update.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of January 24, and highlights changes since our last earnings call on her October 21. Movement of molecules to the next phase of development are shown by green arrows of additions from business development additions are shown by green stars. They both demonstrate our focus on addressing our upcoming patent expirations through innovation both that coming from our own lives as well as those from outside our walls. You can see that we added two compounds under regulatory review, that beta amyloid imaging agent from Abbott and litigate the oral DPP for an inhibitor for diabetes from PI. The BI alliance also brought a Phase III compound BI 10773 and oral SGL to inhibitor. We also saw significant movement in the pipeline as sarong was approved. We began Phase III testing of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. For molecules began Phase II testing. Three new molecules began Phase I testing and we terminated development of five molecules and sold one molecule to a third-party. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events we anticipate in 2011 and a detailed discussion of our 2011 financial guidance. Derica?"

Having received FDA approvals late last year, we're preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency. We have a large number of potential regulatory approvals including Bydureon in the EU and a number pending here in the U.S. Linagliptin for type 2 diabetes in collaboration with BI; the liprotamase our recombinant pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, Cialis for BPH and Byetta in combination with basal insulin.
Expected regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA complete response letter from Bydureon and sBLAs for Erbitux, a first-line colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In terms of Phase III trials, we'll complete the DURATION 6-trial comparing Bydureon to Victoza. We also expect the present initial results from the Phase III trials  and advance non small cell lung cancer of Alimta induction followed by Alimta maintenance therapy. Following the initiation of Phase III trials late last year for both and depression and our antibac and antibody RA and lupus, Phase III trials are slated to begin this year for mGlu2/3 in schizophrenia, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and potentially for our anti-IL 17 antibody in RA.
Now as I move on to guidance, I'm going to take a bit more time today and I have in the past to walk you through it. As I want to make sure you understand how we expect some of the more substantial drivers to effect our results in 2011. Now clearly, more sales of the parks in a Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to global patent expiration as well as the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform will have a significant negative impact on our 2011 results. In addition, we'll face some near-term earnings dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011 including the counter cyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time. Japan, emerging markets and animal health, as well as in a number of our patent-protected products in the U.S. and in Europe.
In addition, we expect to see continued benefit from our cost reduction and productivity efforts. I want to make sure you have good visibility into this growth within our business. 
I'll start with a discussion of our bottom-line EPS expectations and then review our individual line item guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range is $0.23 lower due to the estimated IP R&D charge from the BI alliance. On a non-GAAP basis, this represents a decline of between 9% and 12% when compared to 2010. So how does this 9% to 12% EPS decline break out between the negative EPS impact of the items I mentioned earlier and the continued growth in the rest of our business? I'll start with the latter. The underlying EPS growth we expect to see from our business before factoring in expected sales decline in the parks in a Gemzar outside Japan due primarily to patent expirations and U.S. healthcare and the BI Alliance. Now as we've discussed before, we've been making targeted investments in Japan, our emerging markets and animal health and more broadly in our remaining patent protected products. And also we've been aggressively reducing headcount and controlling expenses as we re-base the size of our business. We've seen these efforts pay off in 2010 and expect to see the same in 2011 and beyond. In fact, our 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.15 to $4.30 implies a growth contribution of roughly 15% from these parts of our business.
In Japan, our sales growth has been outstanding in recent years fueled by the launch of products and indications that we're launching more earlier in the U.S. and Europe. On a local currency basis, sales in Japan grew 15% in 2009 and 25% in 2010. As reported by IMS, currently we are far away the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this major market and we or seeing strong growth from a host of products in Japan. Please note that going forward, I'll be citing local currency growth for certain products in Japan as well as in Europe. The effect of foreign exchange for any individual product is similar to that shown on Slide 10 for that relevant something.
Now Zyprexa, our largest-selling product grew 8% on a local currency basis for 2010 and we expect continued growth. In Q4 last year, Zyprexa became the first a typical antipsychotic approved in Japan for bipolar mania. And later this year, we plan to submit for approval in bipolar depression. The remember, we maintain exclusivity in Japan for Zyprexa until September of 2016 and we expect Japan to help drive what we hope will be a significant sail of the Zyprexa sales post in 2011.
Alimta was approved for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan in Q2 of 2009 and achieved the best share of market uptick in the first line non-squamous segment of any market in the world. It is now our second-largest product in Japan and we see continued growth room for growth as we believe more patients with non-squamous cell histology can benefit from treatment with Alimta. 
We've also been driving increased market share with Humalog. This product has been growing at roughly twice the insulin market growth rate and registered 14% growth in local currency in 2010. We are focused on continuing the strong momentum. And we expect to see significant growth contributions from Cymbalta which was launched in Q2 of last year; and for state Byetta both launched this past quarter.
Now turning to emerging markets. Revenue grew 10% in 2010 on a local currency basis. As we've shared with you in the past, we've been making targeted investments in six markets: China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico. In these investments are paying off. Volume growth has accelerated in each of these markets with the exception of Brazil. From 2009 to 2010, volume growth accelerated from 18% to 21% in China from a minus 7% to a positive 21% in Russia, from 4% to 20% in Turkey and from a minus 2% to a positive 19% in Korea, and from 1% to 7% in Mexico.
More broadly, for the 12 months ending September 2010, IMS showed that Lily ranked first in sales growth at 12% among the 10 leading multinational countries across five emerging markets: China, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in emerging markets. We see significant opportunities to do so with our core assets, including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog and Alimta. While the majority of our efforts will be concentrated on maximizing opportunities from our core assets, we will continue to look to supplement this organic growth with targeted business development. 
On a local currency basis, our ALICO animal health business grew 12% in 2009 and 14% in 2010 significantly outpacing overall industry growth. This solid growth was driven by our food animal business and by come for this, our oral flea control products for controlling pain in animals which is a strong update here in the United States.
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of comport to including in the EU this quarter.
In addition, our information has built a robust innovation pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years would launch is expected for multiple products targeting high-value markets such as livestock immune enhancement, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. This quarter in the U.S., we'll launch Assurity, a couple seek treatment for cats and Trizec this, an oral flea and heartworm treatment for dogs. We've also build a substantial development capability in animal health vaccine and have demonstrated willingness to drive the growth in this business via business development. Apart from continued strength in these three countercyclical growth engines, we also see opportunities for growth in the number of patent protected product outside of the emerging markets in Japan.
Now let me cite a few examples. On a local currency basis, Cymbalta grew 15% in Europe last year. Here in the U.S., Cymbalta continues to fare well existing mood and pain indications in a market dominated by generics. And we'll begin active promotional efforts next week for Cymbalta's latest FDA-approved indication, management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.
2010 local currency growth of Alimta was 20% in Europe and 17% in the U.S. This year, we anticipate submitting the results of our S1 2/4 study the FDA for approval of Alimta-induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
In our diabetes business, Humalog registered solid 6% local currency growth in Europe in 2010. Now while sales in the U.S. were essentially flat, in the second half of the year, we saw sustained growth in our new prescription share of rapid and middle realtime analog market for the first time in years. We've also improved Humalog access which should reinforce the positive sharemarket trend as we began in 2011.
Now for Cialis, in Europe we have continue to extend our leading DOT and can sharemarket. While in the U.S., Cialis continued to gain market share and a declining the market.
At the end of last year, we've submitted Cialis for the treatment of benign hyperplasia for the FDA and could have an action before the end of this year. Finally, we continue to see consistent growth and sheriff market for F. yet in the U.S. and in Europe. 2010 sales totaled 150 million and sales in the fourth quarter were $47 million. We remain committed to this product and based on the clinical data we've generated along with we believe FDA has an important role to play in the treatment of patients undergoing PCI.
In addition to maximizing opportunities to drive topline revenue growth for the company, we've also been focused on driving greater productivity. Through deliberate and determine actions, we are tracking to achieve the headcount and cost containment goals we laid out in September of 2009. As of December 312010, excluding strategic headcount additions in key emerging markets in Japan and business development, we have reduced headcount by 3,450 or nearly 2/3 of our goal of 5,500. And we're on track to meet or exceed our goal of reducing our project 2011 cost by $1 billion. We saw some of those benefits of these efforts in the leverage we've generated in 2010 between revenue growth in net income growth, and we expect to see an even greater benefit in 2011. Now hopefully, the information I've shared blisters the opportunities we see for many areas of our company to generate future top line growth and to deliver on our productivity improvement goal. It is through these opportunities and efforts that we expect to generate mid-teens earnings per share growth excluding the impact of the Zyprexa and Gemzar sales reductions outside of Japan. U.S. healthcare U.S. healthcare and the BL Alliance.
Now let me turn to those other items. Outside of Japan, we estimate that Zyprexa and Gemzar sales will decline significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by patent explorations. In total, we anticipate this for EPS growth by approximately 15 to 17 percentage points. We are already seeing rapid erosion of Gemzar to see some continued erosion on interaction international sales where we long patent protection in many markets in early 2009. We also Zyprexa sales to decline rapidly post patent expiration which occurs in April for some International Markets and September for most major European countries, and in October and the United States.
Compared to 2010, U.S. by healthcare reform by an incremental $170 to $270 million and add an additional $150 million to $250 million in non-tax-deductible operating commitments through the Pharmaceutical industry fee. Combined, we estimate this could reduce 2011 EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points.
Finally, we expect our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim to reduce 2011 non-GAAP ATSG to increase SG&A and R&D expenses. Specifically, we expect this alliance to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 4.5% to 5.5 percentage points. However, we view this near-term earnings dilution very differently than that from patent expirations or governmental actions. Clearly, we've anticipated that the near-term earnings dilution is a precursor to longer term EPS accretion and that this alliance adds economic value to Lily and its shareholders and is thus a good investment for the business.
So while we face major headwinds in 2011, we've taken a number of actions designed to significantly mitigate this negative impact and position the company to continue to invest in our long-term growth potential, while funding our dividends, capital expenditures and targeted business development. 
Now, I'll provide some color commentary for our guidance. In terms of the top line, we anticipate 2011 revenue will be flat to slightly increasing compared to 2010. Excluding the anticipated decline of that Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan and the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we expect 2011 revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline approximately two percentage points due to the negative effect of patent losses, the Puerto Rican export tax, and the anticipated negative effect of foreign exchange on international inventory sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid- single-digits. Now it is important to note that the new pharmaceutical industry fee will be booked in this line item of our income statement. In addition, we expect to have substantial additional marketing and selling expenses as a result of the lines for BI. Excluding anticipated expenses from the pharmaceutical industry fee and the BI Alliance, we would anticipate marketing, selling and administrative expenses to be essentially flat. Research and development expenses are expected to be relatively flat. This growth rate is affected by the higher than normal charges in 2010 that flowed through R&D. Excluding these charges from the base period, R&D expenses would be expected to grow in the mid-single-digits with much of this growth driven by our portion of the anticipated clinical trials spent for BI's DPP4 and SGL2 inhibitors.
For the year, other income and deductions are expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million driven largely by net interest expense. The tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 21.5% for the year while the IRS has not provided a final ruling on U.S. tax treatment of the Puerto Rican export tax, for the purposes of our guidance, we have assumed that this export tax will be creditable in the U.S.
Finally, we expect operating cash flow to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of $800 to $900 million as well as the dividend and continued business development.
Slide 19 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2011 guidance. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll take questions. Operator, first caller please."

With respect insulins, I think it really remains to be seen how big of a threat so-called generic versions of insulins will be. We're not blind to this year? Or keeping a careful eye on it, as you know, insulins are a different kind of biologic product. Their production outputs are in the thousands of kilos as supposed to molecule like APO and others. The capital investments required, the complexity of the technology around insulins, I think, serve as more of a barrier to entry perhaps for would be competitors and is going to be the case and other therapeutic categories. But obviously, we're going to stay very plugged into this. I think it's very important to keep in mind that we believe the world can benefit from new and improved insulins which is why we're excited about our two insulin analogues that we disclosed.

In addition, delivery technology has moved a considerable ways since the era of the violent syringe and the something going to continue to pioneer more and more new and innovative ways to administer insulin as part of our value proposition for all those products going forward."

As always, we appreciate your continued interest in our company. We thought, and for the most part, overcame significant headwinds to post strong financial performance in 2010. This was highlighted by volume driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We gain leverage between revenue and operating income growth and posted a robust 8% net income growth. We prudently manage working capital and capital expenditures. And once again generated strong operating cash flow. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2010. We're excited about the opportunities before us in 2011.
As Derica discussed, we entered this year with a keen wariness of the challenges posed by the patent expirations since we face in the YZ period ahead. But we have a focused strategy vote centered on innovation that we're aggressively pursuing. Over the last year, we advanced 16 new molecules into Phase I clinical testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing; and two molecules nearing depression and hour and feedback antibac antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus was into Phase III testing. We concluded the number of business development deals with a bias towards those that provide current or potential near-term revenues. We acquired forbid up here with our acquisition of Abbot radiopharmaceuticals. And just last week on FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta amyloid imaging agent if we provide appropriate physician training and successfully reread existing brain scans. And our strategic alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim includes the development and commercialization of two oral diabetes compounds from BI including Linagliptin which could be approved this year and two basal analogue insulins from Lilly. 
In addition, we are prepared to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency and have a number of potential regulatory approvals including Bydureon in the EU and several pending here in the U.S. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011, including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time. Lily is, today, the fastest-growing pharma company in Japan and the fastest-growing among the top 10 multinational companies in key emerging markets.
While Alinco animal health is outpacing its industries growth as well. We'll continue to take advantage of this counter cyclical growth as well as the growth in the number of our patent protected products in the U.S. and Europe. Our strong financial performance, our focus on speeding innovations to patients, and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully traversing years YZ. and emerging with even greater strength and the capacity to drive future growth.

Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly and Company's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
We accomplished a great deal in 2010, while rapidly adapting to significant external and internal challenges. Here are some highlights.  For the full year, we again delivered strong financial performance, generating 6% revenue growth, and we were able to leverage this 6% revenue growth into 8% non-GAAP net income growth, as we made substantial progress reducing headcount and containing costs.
Our strong operating performance, along with prudent management of working capital generated nearly $7 billion of operating cash flow, easily covering capital expenditures of about $700 million, and our dividend of roughly $2.2 billion.
During the year, we did experience pipeline disappointments with  [ph] teplizumab and tasisulam. However, our scientists remain focused on speeding innovation to patients, making significant pipeline progress. Advancing 16 new molecules into Phase I testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules into Phase III testing.
We also concluded a number of business development deals with a bias towards those that provide current or potential near-term revenues.
Our strong financial performance, focus on speeding innovation to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully navigating our upcoming patent explorations and emerging with an even greater strength and capacity to drive future growth.
Since our last earnings call, we've made significant progress on a number of fronts. In clinical news, we began Phase III trials of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Based on an interim review of long-term safety data, and after complication with the FDA, we made the decision to begin Phase III trials later this year of mGlu2/3 of monotherapy treatment for schizophrenia. And along with our partner, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, we disclosed promising Phase IIa data in rheumatoid arthritis for our JACK1/JACK2 inhibitor.
In regulatory news, we received FDA approval of Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain based on clinical trials in patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. And we'll begin active promotion for this indication next week.
We also received FDA approval for Axiron as replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. And we expect to launch the product midyear after building sufficient launch quantities.
Health Canada approved Byetta to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. And we also submitted sNDAs for Byetta used in combination with basal insulin and for Cialis for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
On the legal front, the U.S. District Court ruled that judgment will be entered in Lilly's favor in the Alimta compound patent challenge. Including a recently obtained six-month pediatric exclusivity, this patent provides protection for Alimta until January 17. And the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard our appeal of the U.S. District Court's ruling invalidating our Strattera method-of-use patent. As argued at the appeal hearing, we feel there is a strong basis for the CAFC to overturn the district court ruling. We are awaiting a decision by the CAFC. And in the meantime, an injunction from the CAFC prevents generics from launching.
Finally in business development news, we announced and completed the acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. Avid's lead asset, florbetapir, was assigned a priority review by the FDA. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if certain conditions are met related to physician training and re-reading of existing brain scans.
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced a broad strategic alliance to develop and commercialize two oral diabetes compounds from BI and two basal analog insulins from Lily. As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe brought insights in some underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
On Slide 7, you can see the revenue grew 4% in Q4 to nearly $6.2 billion. As I'll show more detail in a minute, volume continue to be the major driver of our revenue growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points from 75.9% to 80.1%. Roughly 2/3 of this increase was due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventory sold. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar substantially increased cost of sales in Q4 2009 but slightly decreased cost of sales in Q4 2010. The remaining improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue was due to lower manufacturing costs, a tangible result of our ongoing productivity improvement efforts.
This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 8%. Within operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 2% as higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative expenses and a company-wide cost containment efforts. R&D expense, on the other hand, grew 18%. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was due to higher than normal charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. Other income and deductions improved due to primarily to lower miscellaneous other expense and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate fell by four percentage points largely due to the recognition in Q4 of the full year impact of the extension of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share increased 24% and 22% respectively.
For the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and net income, as revenue grew 6% while net income grew 8%. We achieved this leverage between revenue and net income despite foreign exchange being a drag on our gross margin percent for the full year, higher than normal charges flowing through R&D in 2010 and a 1.6 percentage point increase in the full year tax rate, largely due to the $85 million tax charge taken in Q1 2010 as a result of U.S. healthcare reform.
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP earnings per share. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
As you can see on Slide 10, for both the fourth quarter and the full year, foreign exchange had little effect on revenue growth as a weaker euro was offset by strength in other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen.
Consequently, performance growth and total revenue of 5% for both the quarter and the year was driven by 3% volume growth and a favorable 2% impact from price. In both periods, we saw robust, double-digit volume growth in our Japanese Human Pharmaceutical business and our Global Animal Health business. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.
Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw earlier on our non-GAAP income statement. If you look at the top of the second column of numbers, you'll see the 5% performance growth in revenue I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see the cost of sales actually decreased 2% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. As a result, gross margin grew 7%. Operating expenses grew faster than revenue this quarter. The larger than normal R&D charge, as mentioned earlier, drove the majority of the 9% performance growth in operating expenses. As a result of this increase in operating expenses, our 5% performance growth in revenue translated into 3% performance growth in operating income, while the lower tax rate this quarter boosted growth in EPS to 10%.
Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we've leveraged 5% performance growth in revenue into 7% and 8% growth in operating income and earnings per share, respectively. We achieved this leverage due primarily to lower manufacturing costs. For your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Next, I'll briefly cover some highlights from our quarterly pipeline update.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of January 24 and highlights changes since our last earnings call on October 21. Movement of molecules to the next phase of development are shown by green arrows and additions from business development are shown by green stars. They both demonstrate our focus on addressing our upcoming patent expirations through innovation, both that coming from our own labs, as well as from outside our walls. You can see that we added two compounds under regulatory review: florbetapir, the beta-amyloid imaging agent from Avid and linagliptin, the oral DPP-4 inhibitor for diabetes from BI. The BI alliance also brought a Phase III compound, BI 10773, an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor. We also saw significant movement in the pipeline as Axiron was approved. We began Phase III testing of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Four molecules began Phase II testing, three new molecules began Phase I testing, and we terminated development of five molecules and sold one molecule to a third-party. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events we anticipate in 2011 and a detailed discussion of our 2011 financial guidance. Derica?"

Expected regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA complete response letter for Bydureon and sBLAs for Erbitux, a first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In terms of Phase III trials, we'll complete the DURATION 6 trial comparing Bydureon to Victoza. We also expect to present initial results from the Phase III trial and advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer of Alimta induction followed by Alimta maintenance therapy. Following the initiation of Phase III trials late last year for both NERI and depression and our antibac antibody in RA and lupus, Phase III trials are slated to begin this year for mGlu2/3 in schizophrenia, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and potentially for our anti-IL 17 antibody in RA.
Now as I move on to guidance, I'm going to take a bit more time today than I have in the past to walk you through it, as I want to make sure you understand how we expect some of the more substantial drivers to effect our results in 2011. Now clearly, more sales of Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to global patent expiration as well as the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform will have a significant negative impact on our 2011 results. In addition, we'll face some near-term earnings dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011 including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time, Japan, Emerging Markets and Animal Health, as well as and a number of our patent-protected products in the U.S. and in Europe.
In addition, we expect to see continued benefit from our cost reduction and productivity efforts. I want to make sure you have good visibility into this growth within our business. 
I'll start with a discussion of our bottom line EPS expectations and then review our individual line item guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range is $0.23 lower due to the estimated IP R&D charge from the BI alliance. On a non-GAAP basis, this represents a decline of between 9% and 12% when compared to 2010. So how does this 9% to 12% EPS decline break out between the negative EPS impact of the items I mentioned earlier and the continued growth in the rest of our business? I'll start with the latter. The underlying EPS growth we expect to see from our business before factoring in expected sales decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to patent expirations and U.S. healthcare reform and the BI Alliance. Now as we've discussed before, we've been making targeted investments in Japan, our Emerging Markets and Animal Health and more broadly in our remaining patent protected products. And also, we've been aggressively reducing headcount and controlling expenses as we re-base the size of our business. We've seen these efforts pay off in 2010 and expect to see the same in 2011 and beyond. In fact, our 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.15 to $4.30 implies a growth contribution of roughly 15% from these parts of our business.
In Japan, our sales growth has been outstanding at recent years fueled by the launch of products and indications that we're launching more earlier in the U.S. and Europe. On a local currency basis, sales in Japan grew 15% in 2009 and 25% in 2010. As reported by IMS, currently we are far and away  [ph] the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market. And we're seeing strong growth from a host of products in Japan. Please note that, going forward, I'll be citing local currency growth for certain products in Japan, as well as in Europe. The effect of foreign exchange for any individual product is similar to that shown on Slide 10 for that relevant geography.
Now Zyprexa, our largest-selling product, grew 8% on a local currency basis in 2010, and we expect continued growth. In Q4 last year, Zyprexa became the first atypical antipsychotic approved in Japan for bipolar mania. And later this year, we plan to submit for approval in bipolar depression. Now remember, we maintain exclusivity in Japan for Zyprexa until December of 2015, and we expect Japan to help drive what we hope will be a significant tail of Zyprexa sales post 2011.
Alimta was approved for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan in Q2 of 2009 and achieved the best share of market uptick in the first line nonsquamous segment of any market in the world. It is now our second-largest product in Japan, and we see continued room for growth, as we believe more patients with nonsquamous cell histology can benefit from the treatment with Alimta. 
We've also been driving increased market share with Humalog. This product has been growing at roughly twice the insulin market growth rate and registered 14% growth in local currency in 2010. We are focused on continuing the strong momentum. And we expect to see significant growth contributions from Cymbalta, which was launched in Q2 of last year, and Forteo and Byetta, both launched this past quarter.
Now turning to emerging markets. Revenue grew 10% in 2010 on a local currency basis. As we've shared with you in the past, we've been making targeted investments in six markets: China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico. And these investments are paying off. Volume growth has accelerated in each of these markets with the exception of Brazil. From 2009 to 2010, volume growth accelerated from 18% to 21% in China, from a minus 7% to a positive 21% in Russia, from 4% to 20% in Turkey and from a minus 2% to a positive 19% in Korea, and from 1% to 7% in Mexico.
More broadly, for the 12 months ending September 2010, IMS showed that Lily ranked first in sales growth at 12% among the 10 leading multinational countries across five emerging markets: China, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in emerging markets. We see significant opportunities to do so with our core assets, including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog and Alimta. While the majority of our efforts will be concentrated on maximizing opportunities from our core assets, we will continue to look to supplement this organic growth with targeted business development. 
On a local currency basis, our Elanco Animal Health business grew 12% in 2009 and 14% in 2010, significantly outpacing overall industry growth. This solid growth was driven by our Food Animal business and by Comfortis, our oral flea control products for companion animals, which has had a strong uptake here in the United States.
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Comfortis, including in the EU this quarter.
In addition, Elanco has built a robust innovation pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launched expected for multiple products targeting high-value markets, such as livestock immune enhancement, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. This quarter in the U.S., we'll launch Assurity, a topical flea treatment for cats, and Trifexis, an oral flea and heartworm treatment for dogs. We've also built a substantial development capability in animal health vaccine and have demonstrated a willingness to drive the growth to this business via business development. Apart from continued strength in these three countercyclical growth engines, we also see opportunities for growth in a number of patent-protected product outside of the emerging markets in Japan.
Now let me cite a few examples. On a local currency basis, Cymbalta grew 15% in Europe last year. Here in the U.S., Cymbalta continues to fare well in its existing mood and pain indications in a market dominated by generics. And we'll begin active promotional efforts next week for Cymbalta's latest FDA-approved indication, management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.
2010 local currency growth of Alimta was 20% in Europe and 17% in the U.S. This year, we anticipate submitting the results of our S1 2/4 study to the FDA for approval of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
In our Diabetes business, Humalog registered solid 6% local currency growth in Europe in 2010. Now while sales in the U.S. were essentially flat, in the second half of the year, we saw sustained growth in our new prescription share of rapid and middle time analog market for the first time in years. We've also improved Humalog access, which should reinforce the positive sharemarket trend as we begin 2011.
Now for Cialis, in Europe we have continued to extend our leading DOT and cash share market. While in the U.S., Cialis has continued to gain market share in a declining ED market.
At the end of last year, we've submitted Cialis for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to the FDA and could have an action before the end of this year. Finally, we continue to see consistent growth in shared market for Effient in the U.S. and in Europe. 2010 sales total $115 million, and sales in the fourth quarter were $47 million. We remain committed to this product, and based on the clinical data we've generated along with Daichi Sankyo, we believe Effient has an important role to play in the treatment of ACS patients undergoing PCI.
In addition to maximizing opportunities to drive top line revenue growth for the company, we've also been focused on driving greater productivity. Through deliberate and determined actions, we're tracking to achieve the headcount and cost containment goals we laid out in September of 2009. As of December 31, 2010, excluding strategic headcount additions in key emerging markets in Japan and business development, We had reduced headcount by 3,450 or nearly 2/3 of our goal of 5,500. And we're on track to meet or exceed our goal of reducing our projected 2011 cost by $1 billion. We saw some of those benefits of these efforts in the leverage we generated in 2010 between revenue growth and net income growth, and we expect to see an even greater benefit in 2011. Now hopefully, the information I've shared illustrates the opportunities we see for many areas of our company to generate future top line growth and to deliver on our productivity improvement goal. It is through these opportunities and efforts that we expect to generate mid-teens earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of the Zyprexa and Gemzar sales reductions outside of Japan, U.S. healthcare reform and the BI alliance.
Now let me turn to those other items. Outside of Japan, we estimate that Zyprexa and Gemzar sales will decline significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by patent expirations. In total, we anticipate this will lower EPS growth by approximately 15 to 17 percentage points. We are already seeing rapid erosion of Gemzar sales in the US and expect to see some continued erosion in international sales where we lost patent protection in many markets in early 2009. We also anticipate Zyprexa sales to decline rapidly post patent expiration, which occurs in April for some International Markets and September for most major European countries, and in October, in the United States.
Compared to 2010, U.S. healthcare reform could lower 2011 revenue by an incremental $170 to $270 million and add an additional $150 million to $200 million in non-tax-deductible operating commitments through the pharmaceutical industry fee. Combined, we estimate this could reduce 2011 EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points.
Finally, we expect our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS to increase SG&A and R&D expenses. Specifically, we expect this alliance to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points. However, we view this near-term earnings dilution very differently than that from patent expirations or governmental actions. Clearly, we've anticipated that the near-term earnings dilution is a precursor to longer term EPS accretion. And that this alliance adds economic value to Lily and its shareholders and is thus a good investment for the business.
So while we face major headwinds in 2011, we've taken a number of actions designed to significantly mitigate this negative impact and position the company to continue to invest in our long-term growth potential, while funding our dividends, capital expenditures and targeted business development. 
Now I'll provide some color commentary on our [ph] guidance. In terms of the top line, we anticipate 2011 revenue will be flat to slightly increasing compared to 2010. Excluding the anticipated decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan and the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we would expect 2011 revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline approximately two percentage points due to the negative effect of patent losses, the Puerto Rican export tax and the anticipated negative effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid- single-digits. Now it is important to note that the new pharmaceutical industry fee will be booked in this line item of our income statement. In addition, we expect to have substantial additional marketing and selling expenses as a result of the alliance with BI. Excluding anticipated expenses from the pharmaceutical industry fee and the BI alliance, we would anticipate marketing, selling and administrative expenses to be essentially flat. Research and development expenses are expected to be relatively flat. This growth rate is affected by the higher than normal charges in 2010 that flowed through R&D. Excluding these charges from the base period, R&D expenses would be expected to grow in the mid-single-digits with much of this growth driven by our portion of the anticipated clinical trials spent for BI's DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors.
For the year, other income and deductions are expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million driven largely by net interest expense. The tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 21.5% for the year, while the IRS has not provided a final ruling on U.S. tax treatment of the Puerto Rican export tax. For the purposes of our guidance, we have assumed that this export tax will be creditable in the U.S.
Finally, we expect operating cash flow to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 to $900 million, as well as the dividend and continued business development.
Slide 19 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2011 guidance. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll take your questions. Operator, first caller, please."

I'm not, right now, at liberty to discuss the range of tactics, et cetera. But it's obviously a very important new indication for, as you know, for a molecule that now has five or six approved indications in different countries around the world. It's going to be Cymbalta, as Derica pointed out. It's going to be an important growth driver for us in this beginning of this Y-Z period. With respect to insulins, I think it really remains to be seen how big of a threat so-called generic versions of insulins will be. We're not blind to this? We're keeping a careful eye on it, as you know. Insulins are a different kind of biologic product. Their production outputs are in the thousands of kilos, as opposed to molecules like EPO and others. The capital investments required, the complexity of the technology around insulins, I think, serve as more of a barrier to entry perhaps for would-be competitors, then it's going to be the case in other therapeutic categories. But obviously, we're going to stay very plugged in to this. I think it's very important to keep in mind that we believe the world can benefit from new and improved insulins, which is why we're excited about our two insulin analogs that we disclosed. We were now partnering with BI to bring to the market. In addition, delivery technology has moved a considerable ways since the era of the violent syringe. And Lilly going to continue to pioneer new and more convenient ways to administer insulin as part of our value proposition for all those products going forward."

Well, actually it's 10% performance, a very robust growth. We did have a spike in Q3 that came down a little bit in Q4 due to timing of orders. Specifically in Q4, we had about percent total growth, nearly all of which was from performance despite -- we have references that compares to 18% growth in Q3, 16% of which was performance. Some of the things that we saw, for example, Tim, to give some color. There would've been some Zyprexa orders, for example, in Brazil but would have expected to come through in Q4. They did not come through in Q4. They did come through early this Q1. So again, we think, by looking at that full-year number gives you a better trend for how the emerging markets are growing. And again that's 10% performance."

And when you break that down, you really saw even in Europe where we are already in some YZ aspect in terms of Gemzar erosion, we still were able to drive good volume growth. And so when we look forward, we really see those markets, like the emerging market in Japan, really acting in a countercyclical manner compared to what we're going to see in the U.S. in 2011, as well as in Europe major markets in 2011 with the Zyprexa effect.

As always, we appreciate your continued interest in our company. We fought, and for the most part, overcame significant headwinds to post strong financial performance in 2010. This was highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We gained leverage between revenue and operating income growth and posted a robust 8% net income growth. We prudently managed working capital and capital expenditures, and once again generated strong operating cash flow. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2010. We're excited about the opportunities before us in 2011.
As Derica discussed, we entered this year with a keen awareness of the challenges posed by the patent expirations since we faced in the YZ period ahead. But we have a focused strategy centered on innovation that we're aggressively pursuing. Over the last year, we advanced 16 new molecules into Phase I clinical testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules ready for depression and our antibac antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus into Phase III testing. We concluded a number of business development deals with a bias toward those that provide current or potential near-term revenues. We acquired florbetapir with our acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if we provide appropriate physician training and successfully re-read existing brain scans. And our strategic alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim includes the development and commercialization of two oral diabetes compounds from BI, including linagliptin, which could be approved this year and two basal analog insulins from Lilly. 
In addition, we are preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency and have a number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU and several pending here in the U.S. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011, including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time. Lily is, today, the fastest-growing pharma company in Japan and the fastest-growing among the top 10 multinational companies in key emerging markets, while Elanco Animal Health is outpacing its industries growth, as well. We'll continue to take advantage of this countercyclical growth, as well as the growth in the number of our patent protected products in the U.S. and Europe. Our strong financial performance, our focus on speeding innovations to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully traversing Years YZ and emerging with even greater strength and the capacity to drive future growth. We'll continue to act with urgency and purpose to overcome the challenges we face. And as always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Thanks again for joining us. Have a great day."

Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly and Company's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
We accomplished a great deal in 2010, while rapidly adapting to significant external and internal challenges. Here are some highlights.  For the full year, we again delivered strong financial performance, generating 6% revenue growth, and we were able to leverage this 6% revenue growth into 8% non-GAAP net income growth, as we made substantial progress reducing headcount and containing costs.
Our strong operating performance, along with prudent management of working capital generated nearly $7 billion of operating cash flow, easily covering capital expenditures of about $700 million, and our dividend of roughly $2.2 billion.
During the year, we did experience pipeline disappointments with semagacestat, teplizumab and tasisulam. However, our scientists remain focused on speeding innovation to patients, making significant pipeline progress. Advancing 16 new molecules into Phase I testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules into Phase III testing.
We also concluded a number of business development deals with a bias towards those that provide current or potential near-term revenues.
Our strong financial performance, focus on speeding innovation to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully navigating our upcoming patent explorations and emerging with an even greater strength and capacity to drive future growth.
Since our last earnings call, we've made significant progress on a number of fronts. In clinical news, we began Phase III trials of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Based on an interim review of long-term safety data, and after complication with the FDA, we made the decision to begin Phase III trials later this year of mGlu2/3 of monotherapy treatment for schizophrenia. And along with our partner, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, we disclosed promising Phase IIa data in rheumatoid arthritis for our JAK-1/JAK-2 inhibitor.
In regulatory news, we received FDA approval of Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain based on clinical trials in patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. And we'll begin active promotion for this indication next week.
We also received FDA approval for Axiron as replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. And we expect to launch the product midyear after building sufficient launch quantities.
Health Canada approved Byetta to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. And we also submitted sNDAs for Byetta used in combination with basal insulin and for Cialis for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
On the legal front, the U.S. District Court ruled that judgment would be entered in Lilly's favor in the Alimta compound patent challenge. Including a recently obtained six-month pediatric exclusivity, this patent provides protection for Alimta until January 2017. And the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard our appeal of the U.S. District Court's ruling invalidating our Strattera method-of-use patent. As argued at the appeal hearing, we feel there is a strong basis for the CAFC to overturn the district court ruling. We are awaiting a decision by the CAFC. And in the meantime, an injunction from the CAFC prevents generics from launching.
Finally in business development news, we announced and completed the acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. Avid's lead asset, florbetapir, was assigned a priority review by the FDA. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if certain conditions are met related to physician training and re-reading of existing brain scans.
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced a broad strategic alliance to develop and commercialize two oral diabetes compounds from BI and two basal analog insulins from Lilly. As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe brought insights in some underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
On Slide 7, you can see the revenue grew 4% in Q4 to nearly $6.2 billion. As I'll show more detail in a minute, volume continue to be the major driver of our revenue growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points from 75.9% to 80.1%. Roughly 2/3 of this increase was due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventory sold. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar substantially increased cost of sales in Q4 2009 but slightly decreased cost of sales in Q4 2010. The remaining improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue was due to lower manufacturing costs, a tangible result of our ongoing productivity improvement efforts.
This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 8%. Within operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 2% as higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative expenses and a company-wide cost containment efforts. R&D expense, on the other hand, grew 18%. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was due to higher than normal charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. Other income and deductions improved due to primarily to lower miscellaneous other expense and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate fell by four percentage points largely due to the recognition in Q4 2010 of the full year impact of the extension of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share increased 24% and 22% respectively.
For the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and net income, as revenue grew 6% while net income grew 8%. We achieved this leverage between revenue and net income despite foreign exchange being a drag on our gross margin percent for the full year, higher than normal charges flowing through R&D in 2010 and a 1.6 percentage point increase in the full year tax rate, largely due to the $85 million tax charge taken in Q1 2010 as a result of U.S. healthcare reform.
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP earnings per share. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
As you can see on Slide 10, for both the fourth quarter and the full year, foreign exchange had little effect on revenue growth as a weaker euro was offset by strength in other foreign currencies, including the Japanese Yen.
Consequently, performance growth and total revenue of 5% for both the quarter and the year was driven by 3% volume growth and a favorable 2% impact from price. In both periods, we saw robust, double-digit volume growth in our Japanese Human Pharmaceutical business and our Global Animal Health business. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.
Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw earlier on our non-GAAP income statement. If you look at the top of the second column of numbers, you'll see the 5% performance growth in revenue I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see the cost of sales actually decreased 2% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. As a result, gross margin grew 7%. Operating expenses grew faster than revenue this quarter. The larger than normal R&D charge, as mentioned earlier, drove the majority of the 9% performance growth in operating expenses. As a result of this increase in operating expenses, our 5% performance growth in revenue translated into 3% performance growth in operating income, while the lower tax rate this quarter boosted growth in EPS to 10%.
Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we've leveraged 5% performance growth in revenue into 7% and 8% growth in operating income and earnings per share, respectively. We achieved this leverage due primarily to lower manufacturing costs. For your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Next, I'll briefly cover some highlights from our quarterly pipeline update.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of January 24 and highlights changes since our last earnings call on October 21. Movement of molecules to the next phase of development are shown by green arrows and additions from business development are shown by green stars. They both demonstrate our focus on addressing our upcoming patent expirations through innovation, both that coming from our own labs, as well as from outside our walls. You can see that we added two compounds under regulatory review: florbetapir, the beta-amyloid imaging agent from Avid and linagliptin, the oral DPP-4 inhibitor for diabetes from BI. The BI alliance also brought a Phase III compound, BI 10773, an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor. We also saw significant movement in the pipeline as Axiron was approved. We began Phase III testing of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Four molecules began Phase II testing, three new molecules began Phase I testing, and we terminated development of five molecules and sold one molecule to a third-party. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events we anticipate in 2011 and a detailed discussion of our 2011 financial guidance. Derica?"

Having received FDA approvals late last year, we're preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency. We have a large number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU",2549,"Thanks, Phil. Having received FDA approvals late last year, we're preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency. We have a large number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU and a number pending here in the U.S.; linagliptin for type 2 diabetes in collaboration with BI; liprotamase, our recombinant pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and florbetapir, Cialis for BPH and Byetta in combination with basal insulin.
Expected regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA complete response letter for Bydureon and sBLAs for Erbitux, a first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In terms of Phase III trials, we'll complete the DURATION 6 trial comparing Bydureon to Victoza. We also expect to present initial results from the Phase III trial and advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer of Alimta induction followed by Alimta maintenance therapy. Following the initiation of Phase III trials late last year for both NERI and depression and our antibac antibody in RA and lupus, Phase III trials are slated to begin this year for mGlu2/3 in schizophrenia, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and potentially for our anti-IL 17 antibody in RA.
Now as I move on to guidance, I'm going to take a bit more time today than I have in the past to walk you through it, as I want to make sure you understand how we expect some of the more substantial drivers to affect our results in 2011. Now clearly, more sales of Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to global patent expiration as well as the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform will have a significant negative impact on our 2011 results. In addition, we'll face some near-term earnings dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011 including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time, Japan, Emerging Markets and Animal Health, as well as and a number of our patent-protected products in the U.S. and in Europe.
In addition, we expect to see continued benefit from our cost reduction and productivity efforts. I want to make sure you have good visibility into this growth within our business. 
I'll start with a discussion of our bottom line EPS expectations and then review our individual line item guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range is $0.23 lower due to the estimated IP R&D charge from the BI alliance. On a non-GAAP basis, this represents a decline of between 9% and 12% when compared to 2010. So how does this 9% to 12% EPS decline break out between the negative EPS impact of the items I mentioned earlier and the continued growth in the rest of our business? I'll start with the latter. The underlying EPS growth we expect to see from our business before factoring in expected sales decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to patent expirations and U.S. healthcare reform and the BI Alliance. Now as we've discussed before, we've been making targeted investments in Japan, our Emerging Markets and Animal Health and more broadly in our remaining patent protected products. And also, we've been aggressively reducing headcount and controlling expenses as we re-base the size of our business. We've seen these efforts pay off in 2010 and expect to see the same in 2011 and beyond. In fact, our 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.15 to $4.30 implies a growth contribution of roughly 15% from these parts of our business.
In Japan, our sales growth has been outstanding at recent years fueled by the launch of products and indications that we're launch more earlier in the U.S. and Europe. On a local currency basis, sales in Japan grew 15% in 2009 and 25% in 2010. As reported by IMS, currently we are far and away the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market. And we're seeing strong growth from a host of products in Japan. Please note that, going forward, I'll be citing local currency growth for certain products in Japan, as well as in Europe. The effect of foreign exchange for any individual product is similar to that shown on Slide 10 for that relevant geography.
Now Zyprexa, our largest-selling product, grew 8% on a local currency basis in 2010, and we expect continued growth. In Q4 last year, Zyprexa became the first atypical antipsychotic approved in Japan for bipolar mania. And later this year, we plan to submit for approval in bipolar depression. Now remember, we maintain exclusivity in Japan for Zyprexa until December of 2015, and we expect Japan to help drive what we hope will be a significant tail of Zyprexa sales post 2011.
Alimta was approved for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan in Q2 of 2009 and achieved the best share of market uptake in the first line nonsquamous segment of any market in the world. It is now our second-largest product in Japan, and we see continued room for growth, as we believe more patients with nonsquamous cell histology can benefit from the treatment with Alimta. 
We've also been driving increased share of market with Humalog. This product has been growing at roughly twice the insulin market growth rate and registered 14% growth in local currency in 2010. We are focused on continuing the strong momentum. And we expect to seek significant growth contributions from Cymbalta, which was launched in Q2 of last year, and FORTEO and Byetta, both launched this past quarter.
Now turning to emerging markets. Revenue grew 10% in 2010 on a local currency basis. As we've shared with you in the past, we've been making targeted investments in six markets: China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico. And these investments are paying off. Volume growth has accelerated in each of these markets with the exception of Brazil. From 2009 to 2010, volume growth accelerated from 18% to 21% in China, from a minus 7% to a positive 21% in Russia, from 4% to 20% in Turkey and from a minus 2% to a positive 19% in Korea, and from 1% to 7% in Mexico.
More broadly, for the 12 months ending September 2010, IMS showed that Lilly ranked first in sales growth at 12% among the 10 leading multinational companies across five emerging markets: China, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in emerging markets. We see significant opportunities to do so with our core assets, including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog and Alimta. While the majority of our efforts will be concentrated on maximizing opportunities from our core assets, we will continue to look to supplement this organic growth with targeted business development. 
On a local currency basis, our Elanco Animal Health business grew 12% in 2009 and 14% in 2010, significantly outpacing overall industry growth. This solid growth was driven by our Food Animal business and by Comfortis, our oral flea control products for companion animals, which has had a strong uptake here in the United States.
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Comfortis, including in the EU this quarter.
In addition, Elanco has built a robust innovation pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launch as expected for multiple products targeting high-value markets, such as livestock immune enhancement, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. This quarter in the U.S., we'll launch Assurity, a topical flea treatment for cats, and Trifexis, an oral flea and heartworm treatment for dogs. We've also built a substantial development capability in animal health vaccine and have demonstrated a willingness to drive the growth to this business via business development. Apart from continued strength in these three countercyclical growth engines, we also see opportunities for growth in a number of patent-protected product outside of the emerging markets in Japan.
Now let me cite a few examples. On a local currency basis, Cymbalta grew 15% in Europe last year. Here in the U.S., Cymbalta continues to fare well in its existing mood and pain indications in a market dominated by generics. And we'll begin active promotional efforts next week for Cymbalta's latest FDA-approved indication, management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.
2010 local currency growth of Alimta was 20% in Europe and 17% in the U.S. This year, we anticipate submitting the results of our S124 study to the FDA for approval of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
In our Diabetes business, Humalog registered solid 6% local currency growth in Europe in 2010. Now while sales in the U.S. were essentially flat, in the second half of the year, we saw sustained growth in our new prescription share of rapid and middle time analog market for the first time in years. We've also improved Humalog access, which should reinforce the positive sharemarket trend as we begin 2011.
Now for Cialis, in Europe we have continued to extend our leading DOT and cash share market. While in the U.S., Cialis has continued to gain market share in a declining ED market.
At the end of last year, we've submitted Cialis for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to the FDA and could have an action before the end of this year. Finally, we continue to seek consistent growth in shared market for Effient in the U.S. and in Europe. 2010 sales total $115 million, and sales in the fourth quarter were $47 million. We remain committed to this product, and based on the clinical data we've generated along with Daichi Sankyo, we believe Effient has an important role to play in the treatment of ACS patients undergoing PCI.
In addition to maximizing opportunities to drive top line revenue growth for the company, we've also been focused on driving greater productivity. Through deliberate and determined actions, we're tracking to achieve the headcount and cost containment goals we laid out in September of 2009. As of December 31, 2010, excluding strategic headcount additions in key emerging markets in Japan and business development, we had reduced headcount by 3,450 or nearly 2/3 of our goal of 5,500. And we're on track to meet or exceed our goal of reducing our projected 2011 cost by $1 billion. We saw some of those benefits of these efforts in the leverage we generated in 2010 between revenue growth and net income growth, and we expect to see an even greater benefit in 2011. Now hopefully, the information I've shared illustrates the opportunities we see for many areas of our company to generate future top line growth and to deliver on our productivity improvement goal. It is through these opportunities and efforts that we expect to generate mid-teens earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of the Zyprexa and Gemzar sales reductions outside of Japan, U.S. healthcare reform and the BI alliance.
Now let me turn to those other items. Outside of Japan, we estimate that Zyprexa and Gemzar sales will decline significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by patent expirations. In total, we anticipate this will lower EPS growth by approximately 15 to 17 percentage points. We are already seeing rapid erosion of Gemzar sales in the US and expect to see some continued erosion in international sales where we lost patent protection in many markets in early 2009. We also anticipate Zyprexa sales to decline rapidly post patent expiration, which occurs in April for some international markets and September for most major European countries, and in October, in the United States.
Compared to 2010, U.S. healthcare reform could lower 2011 revenue by an incremental $170 to $270 million and add an additional $150 million to $200 million in non-tax-deductible operating commitments through the pharmaceutical industry fee. Combined, we estimate this could reduce 2011 EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points.
Finally, we expect our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS to increase SG&A and R&D expenses. Specifically, we expect this alliance to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points. However, we view this near-term earnings dilution very differently than that from patent expirations or governmental actions. Clearly, we've anticipated that the near-term earnings dilution is a precursor to longer term EPS accretion. And that this alliance adds economic value to Lilly and its shareholders and is thus a good investment for the business.
So while we face major headwinds in 2011, we've taken a number of actions designed to significantly mitigate this negative impact and position the company to continue to invest in our long-term growth potential, while funding our dividends, capital expenditures and targeted business development. 
Now I'll provide some color commentary on our [ph] guidance. In terms of the top line, we anticipate 2011 revenue will be flat to slightly increasing compared to 2010. Excluding the anticipated decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan and the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we would expect 2011 revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline approximately two percentage points due to the negative effect of patent losses, the Puerto Rican export tax and the anticipated negative effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid- single-digits. Now it is important to note that the new pharmaceutical industry fee will be booked in this line item of our income statement. In addition, we expect to have substantial additional marketing and selling expenses as a result of the alliance with BI. Excluding anticipated expenses from the pharmaceutical industry fee and the BI alliance, we would anticipate marketing, selling and administrative expenses to be essentially flat. Research and development expenses are expected to be relatively flat. This growth rate is affected by the higher than normal charges in 2010 that flowed through R&D. Excluding these charges from the base period, R&D expenses would be expected to grow in the mid-single-digits with much of this growth driven by our portion of the anticipated clinical trials spent for BI's DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors.
For the year, other income and deductions are expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million driven largely by net interest expense. The tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 21.5% for the year, while the IRS has not provided a final ruling on U.S. tax treatment of the Puerto Rican export tax. For the purposes of our guidance, we have assumed that this export tax will be creditable in the U.S.
Finally, we expect operating cash flow to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $900 million, as well as the dividend and continued business development.
Slide 19 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2011 guidance.

I'm not, right now, at liberty to discuss the range of tactics, et cetera. But it's obviously a very important new indication for, as you know, for a molecule that now has five or six approved indications in different countries around the world. It's going to be Cymbalta, as Derica pointed out. It's going to be an important growth driver for us in this beginning of this YZ period. With respect to insulins, I think it really remains to be seen how big of a threat so-called generic versions of insulins will be. We're not blind to this. We're keeping a careful eye on it, as you know. Insulins are a different kind of biologic product. Their production outputs are in the thousands of kilos, as opposed to molecules like EPO and others. The capital investments required, the complexity of the technology around insulins, I think, serve as more of a barrier to entry perhaps for would-be competitors, then it's going to be the case in other therapeutic categories. But obviously, we're going to stay very plugged in to this. I think it's very important to keep in mind that we believe the world can benefit from new and improved insulins, which is why we're excited about our two insulin analogs that we disclosed. We were now partnering with BI to bring to the market. In addition, delivery technology has moved a considerable ways since the era of the violent syringe. And Lilly going to continue to pioneer new and more convenient ways to administer insulin as part of our value proposition for all those products going forward."

And then second question on 2014 guidance that you've given before. I got on the call late, but I'm not sure if you've talked about 2014 or not. Is that still on track?

First of all, with the patent expirations with Zyprexa and Gemzar, the mix effect of that create upward pressure on our tax rate. Also, the second factor affecting our tax rate, which also creates upward pressure, is the pharmaceutical industry fee, which is non-tax-deductible. What's creating a lowering pressure on our effective tax rate is the assumption that we'll be able to credit the Puerto Rico excise tax. So that's how we get to the tax rate that you saw. In regards to the 2014 guidance, Tim, we did not discuss that on the call today. And we still look forward to update that at our June Analyst Meeting in New York."

That will not be recurring in our 2011 or going forward numbers. And then in terms of the emerging market, as we've said in the call, the full year growth rate was 14% total. Well, actually it's 10% performance, a very robust growth. We did have a spike in Q3 that came down a little bit in Q4 due to timing of orders. Specifically in Q4, we had about 6% total growth, nearly all of which was from performance despite -- we have references that compares to 18% growth in Q3, 16% of which was performance. Some of the things that we saw, for example, Tim, to give some color. There would've been some Zyprexa orders, for example, in Brazil but would have expected to come through in Q4. They did not come through in Q4. They did come through early this Q1. So again, we think, by looking at that full-year number gives you a better trend for how the emerging markets are growing. And again that's 10% performance."

As always, we appreciate your continued interest in our company. We fought, and for the most part, overcame significant headwinds to post strong financial performance in 2010. This was highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We gained leverage between revenue and operating income growth and posted a robust 8% net income growth. We prudently managed working capital and capital expenditures, and once again generated strong operating cash flow. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2010. We're excited about the opportunities before us in 2011.
As Derica discussed, we entered this year with a keen awareness of the challenges posed by the patent expirations we faced in the YZ period ahead. But we have a focused strategy centered on innovation that we're aggressively pursuing. Over the last year, we advanced 16 new molecules into Phase I clinical testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules NERI for depression and our antibac antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus into Phase III testing. We concluded a number of business development deals with a bias toward those that provide current or potential near-term revenues. We acquired florbetapir with our acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if we provide appropriate physician training and successfully re-read existing brain scans. And our strategic alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim includes the development and commercialization of two oral diabetes compounds from BI, including linagliptin, which could be approved this year and two basal analog insulins from Lilly. 
In addition, we are preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency and have a number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU and several pending here in the U.S. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011, including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time. Lilly is, today, the fastest-growing pharma company in Japan and the fastest-growing among the top 10 multinational companies in key emerging markets, while Elanco Animal Health is outpacing its industries growth, as well. We'll continue to take advantage of this countercyclical growth, as well as the growth in a number of our patent protected products in the U.S. and Europe. Our strong financial performance, our focus on speeding innovations to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully traversing   and emerging with even greater strength and the capacity to drive future growth. We'll continue to act with urgency and purpose to overcome the challenges we face. And as always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Thanks again for joining us. Have a great day."

Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly and Company's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
We accomplished a great deal in 2010, while rapidly adapting to significant external and internal challenges. Here are some highlights.  For the full year, we again delivered strong financial performance, generating 6% revenue growth, and we were able to leverage this 6% revenue growth into 8% non-GAAP net income growth, as we made substantial progress reducing headcount and containing costs.
Our strong operating performance, along with prudent management of working capital generated nearly $7 billion of operating cash flow, easily covering capital expenditures of about $700 million, and our dividend of roughly $2.2 billion.
During the year, we did experience pipeline disappointments with semagacestat, teplizumab and tasisulam. However, our scientists remain focused on speeding innovation to patients, making significant pipeline progress. Advancing 16 new molecules into Phase I testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules into Phase III testing.
We also concluded a number of business development deals with a bias towards those that provide current or potential near-term revenues.
Our strong financial performance, focus on speeding innovation to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully navigating our upcoming patent explorations and emerging with an even greater strength and capacity to drive future growth.
Since our last earnings call, we've made significant progress on a number of fronts. In clinical news, we began Phase III trials of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Based on an interim review of long-term safety data, and after complication with the FDA, we made the decision to begin Phase III trials later this year of mGlu2/3 of monotherapy treatment for schizophrenia. And along with our partner, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, we disclosed promising Phase IIa data in rheumatoid arthritis for our JAK-1/JAK-2 inhibitor.
In regulatory news, we received FDA approval of Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain based on clinical trials in patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. And we'll begin active promotion for this indication next week.
We also received FDA approval for Axiron as replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. And we expect to launch the product midyear after building sufficient launch quantities.
Health Canada approved Byetta to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. And we also submitted sNDAs for Byetta used in combination with basal insulin and for Cialis for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
On the legal front, the U.S. District Court ruled that judgment would be entered in Lilly's favor in the Alimta compound patent challenge. Including a recently obtained six-month pediatric exclusivity, this patent provides protection for Alimta until January 2017. And the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard our appeal of the U.S. District Court's ruling invalidating our Strattera method-of-use patent. As argued at the appeal hearing, we feel there is a strong basis for the CAFC to overturn the district court ruling. We are awaiting a decision by the CAFC. And in the meantime, an injunction from the CAFC prevents generics from launching.
Finally in business development news, we announced and completed the acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. Avid's lead asset, florbetapir, was assigned a priority review by the FDA. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if certain conditions are met related to physician training and re-reading of existing brain scans.
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced a broad strategic alliance to develop and commercialize two oral diabetes compounds from BI and two basal analog insulins from Lilly. As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe brought insights in some underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
On Slide 7, you can see the revenue grew 4% in Q4 to nearly $6.2 billion. As I'll show more detail in a minute, volume continue to be the major driver of our revenue growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points from 75.9% to 80.1%. Roughly 2/3 of this increase was due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventory sold. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar substantially increased cost of sales in Q4 2009 but slightly decreased cost of sales in Q4 2010. The remaining improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue was due to lower manufacturing costs, a tangible result of our ongoing productivity improvement efforts.
This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 8%. Within operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 2% as higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative expenses and a company-wide cost containment efforts. R&D expense, on the other hand, grew 18%. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was due to higher than normal charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. Other income and deductions improved due to primarily to lower miscellaneous other expense and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate fell by four percentage points largely due to the recognition in Q4 2010 of the full year impact of the extension of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share increased 24% and 22% respectively.
For the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and net income, as revenue grew 6% while net income grew 8%. We achieved this leverage between revenue and net income despite foreign exchange being a drag on our gross margin percent for the full year, higher than normal charges flowing through R&D in 2010 and a 1.6 percentage point increase in the full year tax rate, largely due to the $85 million tax charge taken in Q1 2010 as a result of U.S. healthcare reform.
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP earnings per share. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
As you can see on Slide 10, for both the fourth quarter and the full year, foreign exchange had little effect on revenue growth as a weaker euro was offset by strength in other foreign currencies, including the Japanese Yen.
Consequently, performance growth and total revenue of 5% for both the quarter and the year was driven by 3% volume growth and a favorable 2% impact from price. In both periods, we saw robust, double-digit volume growth in our Japanese Human Pharmaceutical business and our Global Animal Health business. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.
Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw earlier on our non-GAAP income statement. If you look at the top of the second column of numbers, you'll see the 5% performance growth in revenue I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see the cost of sales actually decreased 2% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. As a result, gross margin grew 7%. Operating expenses grew faster than revenue this quarter. The larger than normal R&D charge, as mentioned earlier, drove the majority of the 9% performance growth in operating expenses. As a result of this increase in operating expenses, our 5% performance growth in revenue translated into 3% performance growth in operating income, while the lower tax rate this quarter boosted growth in EPS to 10%.
Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we've leveraged 5% performance growth in revenue into 7% and 8% growth in operating income and earnings per share, respectively. We achieved this leverage due primarily to lower manufacturing costs. For your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Next, I'll briefly cover some highlights from our quarterly pipeline update.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of January 24 and highlights changes since our last earnings call on October 21. Movement of molecules to the next phase of development are shown by green arrows and additions from business development are shown by green stars. They both demonstrate our focus on addressing our upcoming patent expirations through innovation, both that coming from our own labs, as well as from outside our walls. You can see that we added two compounds under regulatory review: florbetapir, the beta-amyloid imaging agent from Avid and linagliptin, the oral DPP-4 inhibitor for diabetes from BI. The BI alliance also brought a Phase III compound, BI 10773, an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor. We also saw significant movement in the pipeline as Axiron was approved. We began Phase III testing of our antibac antibody for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Four molecules began Phase II testing, three new molecules began Phase I testing, and we terminated development of five molecules and sold one molecule to a third-party. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events we anticipate in 2011 and a detailed discussion of our 2011 financial guidance. Derica?"

Having received FDA approvals late last year, we're preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency. We have a large number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU",2549,"Thanks, Phil. Having received FDA approvals late last year, we're preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency. We have a large number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU and a number pending here in the U.S.; linagliptin for type 2 diabetes in collaboration with BI; liprotamase, our recombinant pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and florbetapir, Cialis for BPH and Byetta in combination with basal insulin.
Expected regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA complete response letter for Bydureon and sBLAs for Erbitux, a first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In terms of Phase III trials, we'll complete the DURATION 6 trial comparing Bydureon to Victoza. We also expect to present initial results from the Phase III trial and advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer of Alimta induction followed by Alimta maintenance therapy. Following the initiation of Phase III trials late last year for both NERI and depression and our antibac antibody in RA and lupus, Phase III trials are slated to begin this year for mGlu2/3 in schizophrenia, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and potentially for our anti-IL 17 antibody in RA.
Now as I move on to guidance, I'm going to take a bit more time today than I have in the past to walk you through it, as I want to make sure you understand how we expect some of the more substantial drivers to affect our results in 2011. Now clearly, more sales of Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to global patent expiration as well as the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform will have a significant negative impact on our 2011 results. In addition, we'll face some near-term earnings dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011 including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time, Japan, Emerging Markets and Animal Health, as well as and a number of our patent-protected products in the U.S. and in Europe.
In addition, we expect to see continued benefit from our cost reduction and productivity efforts. I want to make sure you have good visibility into this growth within our business. 
I'll start with a discussion of our bottom line EPS expectations and then review our individual line item guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range is $0.23 lower due to the estimated IP R&D charge from the BI alliance. On a non-GAAP basis, this represents a decline of between 9% and 12% when compared to 2010. So how does this 9% to 12% EPS decline break out between the negative EPS impact of the items I mentioned earlier and the continued growth in the rest of our business? I'll start with the latter. The underlying EPS growth we expect to see from our business before factoring in expected sales decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar outside of Japan due primarily to patent expirations and U.S. healthcare reform and the BI Alliance. Now as we've discussed before, we've been making targeted investments in Japan, our Emerging Markets and Animal Health and more broadly in our remaining patent protected products. And also, we've been aggressively reducing headcount and controlling expenses as we re-base the size of our business. We've seen these efforts pay off in 2010 and expect to see the same in 2011 and beyond. In fact, our 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.15 to $4.30 implies a growth contribution of roughly 15% from these parts of our business.
In Japan, our sales growth has been outstanding at recent years fueled by the launch of products and indications that we're launch more earlier in the U.S. and Europe. On a local currency basis, sales in Japan grew 15% in 2009 and 25% in 2010. As reported by IMS, currently we are far and away the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market. And we're seeing strong growth from a host of products in Japan. Please note that, going forward, I'll be citing local currency growth for certain products in Japan, as well as in Europe. The effect of foreign exchange for any individual product is similar to that shown on Slide 10 for that relevant geography.
Now Zyprexa, our largest-selling product, grew 8% on a local currency basis in 2010, and we expect continued growth. In Q4 last year, Zyprexa became the first atypical antipsychotic approved in Japan for bipolar mania. And later this year, we plan to submit for approval in bipolar depression. Now remember, we maintain exclusivity in Japan for Zyprexa until December of 2015, and we expect Japan to help drive what we hope will be a significant tail of Zyprexa sales post 2011.
Alimta was approved for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan in Q2 of 2009 and achieved the best share of market uptake in the first line nonsquamous segment of any market in the world. It is now our second-largest product in Japan, and we see continued room for growth, as we believe more patients with nonsquamous cell histology can benefit from the treatment with Alimta. 
We've also been driving increased share of market with Humalog. This product has been growing at roughly twice the insulin market growth rate and registered 14% growth in local currency in 2010. We are focused on continuing the strong momentum. And we expect to seek significant growth contributions from Cymbalta, which was launched in Q2 of last year, and FORTEO and Byetta, both launched this past quarter.
Now turning to emerging markets. Revenue grew 10% in 2010 on a local currency basis. As we've shared with you in the past, we've been making targeted investments in six markets: China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico. And these investments are paying off. Volume growth has accelerated in each of these markets with the exception of Brazil. From 2009 to 2010, volume growth accelerated from 18% to 21% in China, from a minus 7% to a positive 21% in Russia, from 4% to 20% in Turkey and from a minus 2% to a positive 19% in Korea, and from 1% to 7% in Mexico.
More broadly, for the 12 months ending September 2010, IMS showed that Lilly ranked first in sales growth at 12% among the 10 leading multinational companies across five emerging markets: China, Turkey, Korea, Brazil and Mexico.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in emerging markets. We see significant opportunities to do so with our core assets, including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog and Alimta. While the majority of our efforts will be concentrated on maximizing opportunities from our core assets, we will continue to look to supplement this organic growth with targeted business development. 
On a local currency basis, our Elanco Animal Health business grew 12% in 2009 and 14% in 2010, significantly outpacing overall industry growth. This solid growth was driven by our Food Animal business and by Comfortis, our oral flea control products for companion animals, which has had a strong uptake here in the United States.
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Comfortis, including in the EU this quarter.
In addition, Elanco has built a robust innovation pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launch as expected for multiple products targeting high-value markets, such as livestock immune enhancement, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. This quarter in the U.S., we'll launch Assurity, a topical flea treatment for cats, and Trifexis, an oral flea and heartworm treatment for dogs. We've also built a substantial development capability in animal health vaccine and have demonstrated a willingness to drive the growth to this business via business development. Apart from continued strength in these three countercyclical growth engines, we also see opportunities for growth in a number of patent-protected product outside of the emerging markets in Japan.
Now let me cite a few examples. On a local currency basis, Cymbalta grew 15% in Europe last year. Here in the U.S., Cymbalta continues to fare well in its existing mood and pain indications in a market dominated by generics. And we'll begin active promotional efforts next week for Cymbalta's latest FDA-approved indication, management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.
2010 local currency growth of Alimta was 20% in Europe and 17% in the U.S. This year, we anticipate submitting the results of our S124 study to the FDA for approval of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
In our Diabetes business, Humalog registered solid 6% local currency growth in Europe in 2010. Now while sales in the U.S. were essentially flat, in the second half of the year, we saw sustained growth in our new prescription share of rapid and middle time analog market for the first time in years. We've also improved Humalog access, which should reinforce the positive sharemarket trend as we begin 2011.
Now for Cialis, in Europe we have continued to extend our leading DOT and cash share market. While in the U.S., Cialis has continued to gain market share in a declining ED market.
At the end of last year, we've submitted Cialis for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to the FDA and could have an action before the end of this year. Finally, we continue to seek consistent growth in shared market for Effient in the U.S. and in Europe. 2010 sales total $115 million, and sales in the fourth quarter were $47 million. We remain committed to this product, and based on the clinical data we've generated along with Daichi Sankyo, we believe Effient has an important role to play in the treatment of ACS patients undergoing PCI.
In addition to maximizing opportunities to drive top line revenue growth for the company, we've also been focused on driving greater productivity. Through deliberate and determined actions, we're tracking to achieve the headcount and cost containment goals we laid out in September of 2009. As of December 31, 2010, excluding strategic headcount additions in key emerging markets in Japan and business development, we had reduced headcount by 3,450 or nearly 2/3 of our goal of 5,500. And we're on track to meet or exceed our goal of reducing our projected 2011 cost by $1 billion. We saw some of those benefits of these efforts in the leverage we generated in 2010 between revenue growth and net income growth, and we expect to see an even greater benefit in 2011. Now hopefully, the information I've shared illustrates the opportunities we see for many areas of our company to generate future top line growth and to deliver on our productivity improvement goal. It is through these opportunities and efforts that we expect to generate mid-teens earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of the Zyprexa and Gemzar sales reductions outside of Japan, U.S. healthcare reform and the BI alliance.
Now let me turn to those other items. Outside of Japan, we estimate that Zyprexa and Gemzar sales will decline significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by patent expirations. In total, we anticipate this will lower EPS growth by approximately 15 to 17 percentage points. We are already seeing rapid erosion of Gemzar sales in the US and expect to see some continued erosion in international sales where we lost patent protection in many markets in early 2009. We also anticipate Zyprexa sales to decline rapidly post patent expiration, which occurs in April for some international markets and September for most major European countries, and in October, in the United States.
Compared to 2010, U.S. healthcare reform could lower 2011 revenue by an incremental $170 to $270 million and add an additional $150 million to $200 million in non-tax-deductible operating commitments through the pharmaceutical industry fee. Combined, we estimate this could reduce 2011 EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points.
Finally, we expect our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS to increase SG&A and R&D expenses. Specifically, we expect this alliance to reduce 2011 non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points. However, we view this near-term earnings dilution very differently than that from patent expirations or governmental actions. Clearly, we've anticipated that the near-term earnings dilution is a precursor to longer term EPS accretion. And that this alliance adds economic value to Lilly and its shareholders and is thus a good investment for the business.
So while we face major headwinds in 2011, we've taken a number of actions designed to significantly mitigate this negative impact and position the company to continue to invest in our long-term growth potential, while funding our dividends, capital expenditures and targeted business development. 
Now I'll provide some color commentary on our [ph] guidance. In terms of the top line, we anticipate 2011 revenue will be flat to slightly increasing compared to 2010. Excluding the anticipated decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan and the incremental impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we would expect 2011 revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline approximately two percentage points due to the negative effect of patent losses, the Puerto Rican export tax and the anticipated negative effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid- single-digits. Now it is important to note that the new pharmaceutical industry fee will be booked in this line item of our income statement. In addition, we expect to have substantial additional marketing and selling expenses as a result of the alliance with BI. Excluding anticipated expenses from the pharmaceutical industry fee and the BI alliance, we would anticipate marketing, selling and administrative expenses to be essentially flat. Research and development expenses are expected to be relatively flat. This growth rate is affected by the higher than normal charges in 2010 that flowed through R&D. Excluding these charges from the base period, R&D expenses would be expected to grow in the mid-single-digits with much of this growth driven by our portion of the anticipated clinical trials spent for BI's DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors.
For the year, other income and deductions are expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million driven largely by net interest expense. The tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 21.5% for the year, while the IRS has not provided a final ruling on U.S. tax treatment of the Puerto Rican export tax. For the purposes of our guidance, we have assumed that this export tax will be creditable in the U.S.
Finally, we expect operating cash flow to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $900 million, as well as the dividend and continued business development.
Slide 19 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2011 guidance.

But it's obviously a very important new indication for, as you know, for a molecule that now has five or six approved indications in different countries around the world. It's going to be Cymbalta, as Derica pointed out. It's going to be an important growth driver for us in this beginning of this YZ period. With respect to insulins, I think it really remains to be seen how big of a threat so-called generic versions of insulins will be. We're not blind to this. We're keeping a careful eye on it, as you know. Insulins are a different kind of biologic product. Their production outputs are in the thousands of kilos, as opposed to molecules like EPO and others. The capital investments required, the complexity of the technology around insulins, I think, serve as more of a barrier to entry perhaps for would-be competitors, then it's going to be the case in other therapeutic categories. But obviously, we're going to stay very plugged in to this. I think it's very important to keep in mind that we believe the world can benefit from new and improved insulins, which is why we're excited about our two insulin analogs that we disclosed. We were now partnering with BI to bring to the market. In addition, delivery technology has moved a considerable ways since the era of the violent syringe. And Lilly going to continue to pioneer new and more convenient ways to administer insulin as part of our value proposition for all those products going forward."

That will not be recurring in our 2011 or going forward numbers. And then in terms of the emerging market, as we've said in the call, the full year growth rate was 14% total. Well, actually it's 10% performance, a very robust growth. We did have a spike in Q3 that came down a little bit in Q4 due to timing of orders. Specifically in Q4, we had about 6% total growth, nearly all of which was from performance despite -- we have references that compares to 18% growth in Q3, 16% of which was performance. Some of the things that we saw, for example, Tim, to give some color. There would've been some Zyprexa orders, for example, in Brazil but would have expected to come through in Q4.

As always, we appreciate your continued interest in our company. We fought, and for the most part, overcame significant headwinds to post strong financial performance in 2010. This was highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We gained leverage between revenue and operating income growth and posted a robust 8% net income growth. We prudently managed working capital and capital expenditures, and once again generated strong operating cash flow. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2010. We're excited about the opportunities before us in 2011.
As Derica discussed, we entered this year with a keen awareness of the challenges posed by the patent expirations we faced in the YZ period ahead. But we have a focused strategy centered on innovation that we're aggressively pursuing. Over the last year, we advanced 16 new molecules into Phase I clinical testing, nine molecules into Phase II testing, and two molecules NERI for depression and our antibac antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus into Phase III testing. We concluded a number of business development deals with a bias toward those that provide current or potential near-term revenues. We acquired florbetapir with our acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. And just last week, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of the beta-amyloid imaging agent if we provide appropriate physician training and successfully re-read existing brain scans. And our strategic alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim includes the development and commercialization of two oral diabetes compounds from BI, including linagliptin, which could be approved this year and two basal analog insulins from Lilly. 
In addition, we are preparing to launch Cymbalta for chronic musculoskeletal pain and Axiron for testosterone deficiency and have a number of potential regulatory approvals, including Bydureon in the EU and several pending here in the U.S. At the same time, we expect continued strong performance in the rest of our business in 2011, including the three countercyclical growth engines we've discussed for some time. Lilly is, today, the fastest-growing pharma company in Japan and the fastest-growing among the top 10 multinational companies in key emerging markets, while Elanco Animal Health is outpacing its industries growth, as well. We'll continue to take advantage of this countercyclical growth, as well as the growth in a number of our patent protected products in the U.S. and Europe. Our strong financial performance, our focus on speeding innovations to patients and targeted use of business development all support our goal of successfully traversing   and emerging with even greater strength and the capacity to drive future growth. We'll continue to act with urgency and purpose to overcome the challenges we face. And as always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Thanks again for joining us. Have a great day."

I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Joining me are our President, CEO and
Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan
Lundberg; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations.
Today's Q1 earnings call coincides with our annual shareholder meeting. As a result, our CEO, John Lechleiter is not available to participate in today's call. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is to the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for describing decisions.
Since the Q4 earnings call in late January, we've continued to bolster our operations through business development, to leverage our marketing products and to advance our pipeline. We announced our offer to acquire the Animal Health business of Janssen Pharmaceutica from Johnson & Johnson. This business is primarily European focused targeting disease segments and combating animals and livestock, with special emphasis on swine and poultry. The deal closing, which is expected by mid-year, we would maintain a portfolio of roughly 50 marketed animal health products. 
Here in the U.S., we began active promotion for Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. And we launched Axiron, the first and only testosterone replacement therapy applied to the underarm. On the regulatory front, we submitted our response to the FDA's complete response letter for the use of Erbitux in the first-line head and neck cancer. 
We receive a complete response letter from the FDA for florbetapir, our PET imaging agent being studies for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque. We are working closely with the FDA to address their questions on the reader training program to ensure reading accuracy and consistency of interpretations of beta-amyloid plaque images. 
Late last week, we also received the complete response letter from the FDA for the proteomics, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and we'll be working diligently to address the agency's questions.
In Europe, we submitted our application for the use of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advance, non-squamos, non-small cell lung cancer. And also in Europe, we recently received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Based on this recommendation, we anticipate receiving easy approval by late June.
On the clinical front, we disclosed positive top line results on the Phase II trial of the once monthly formulation of exenatide. We plan to met with regulatory authorities to determine next steps for this program. We also disclosed top line results for the Phase III duration six trial comparing Bydureon to the highest approved dose of Victoza. Bydureon demonstrated a robust reduction on HbA1c baseline, however, it did not meet the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to Victoza 1.8 milligram in the reduction HbA1c. Additional data from the trial is plan to be disclosed at a later date. And we began the first Phase III trial for our mGlu2/3 prodrug for schizophrenia. 
Lastly, on the legal front, while we received a favorable ruling on the Cymbalta patent challenge. Lockhart voluntarily consented to entery of judgment in favor of Lilly on all pending issues, which the judge so ordered. The judge asked the remaining parties to indicate if they intend to proceed to trial and all nine defendants failed to indicate that they intend to proceed. As a result, we remain that there'll be no generic costs in product coming to market until the Cymbalta patent expires. However, a trial date remain on the court's docket for June of this year. A meeting with the court, Lilly and the defendants will be held later this month to determine next steps in this litigation.
While not specific to Lilly, perhaps one of the most notable events since our last earnings call is the disaster Japan caused by the March 11 earthquake and its aftermath. Because Japan is such a big part of our growth strategy, I'd like to provide you with some details. First and foremost, we were relieved that within hours, we were able to account for the safety of all Lilly Japan employees. We're also proud of the support, both monetary and product donations that Lilly Japan, the Lilly Foundation and Eli Lilly and Co. have provided to help those affected by this strategy. 
From a business perspective, our Japanese affiliate headquarters and development center of excellence are located in Kobe, and we have a manufacturing plant in Seshing just outside of Kobe. These operations are approximately 500 miles southwest of the disaster zone. As a result, we had no damages or other issues at these sites.
In terms of product supply, we've encountered no issues getting manufacturing products into or out of Japan. And we have not had and do not anticipate having any issues with the supplier of raw materials, intermediate or finished products from our Japanese suppliers. 
Prior to the earthquake, we had robust inventory levels throughout our supply chain for materials sourced from Japan. In terms of domestic sales, we did receive what appeared to have been precautionary orders from customers totaling $30 million to $35 million in the quarter. We expect that this will wash out in future quarters. 
Our thoughts are with the Japanese people and what will surely be a long and difficult recovery. We will continue to provide them our support, and we'll continue to ensure that Lilly products reach the patients who need them. 
Now at this background, Veronica will discuss our Q1 results and provide our pipeline update and Derek will cover key events for the remainder of 2011 and financial guidance for the year. Veronica?"
285467,97242184,115441,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2011",2011-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.

As we've done on our previous calls, we'll focused our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 7 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement.
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated solid revenue growth of 6% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effect of the U.S. healthcare reform, revenue would have grown 10%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 79.5% to 79.8%. 
Operating expenses defined as a sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. Drivers for the increase included: higher administrative expenses, driven by the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with the U.S. Healthcare Reform and higher litigation expenses. Higher marketing and selling expenses driven by o-U.S. investments primarily in the emerging markets and higher R&D expense due primarily to increased late stage clinical trial expenses.
In addition, both SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to the BI alliance. Excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would have grown 7%. Other income and deductions was a net expense this year compared to net income last year. You may remember that we had substantial in coming Q1 2010 related to the recovery of damages from generic Atlanta premarketers in Germany and from gains on the sales of securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter considerably lower than 27.3% from last year's Q1. Last year's Q1 rate included an $85.1 million charge related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy and did not benefit from the R&D tax credit as it left. This year, we did benefit from the R&D tax credit, as well, as from the resolution of certain IFRS tax matters. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased 5% to $1.24. As indicated, Lilly provided the 2011 guidance in January, we felt robust EPS growth in our business in Q1 excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effect of the Gemzar patent exploration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would have grown low double digit. 
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement while Slide 9 provides reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 revenue. As you can see on Slide 10, total revenue growth of 6% was driven by solid volume growth of 5% and foreign exchange contributing the remaining 1%. Price had no impact on the worldwide revenue growth. We continue to see strong volume growth from our three countercyclical growth engines: Japan, Elanco Animal Health and emerging markets. 
Volume growth in Japan was 34% driven by recent launches of Cymbalta and Forteo as well as continued strong growth of Alimta, Gemzar and Humalog. In addition, roughly a quarter of the Q1 volume growth was attributable to precautionary buying Phil mentioned earlier. 
Elanco Animal Health volume growth of 25% in Q1 driven by the increased demand for food animal products globally, as well, as by the launch of Trifexis in the U.S. and the acquisition of certain European Animal Health assets from Pfizer. 
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Trifexis. In addition, Elanco has build a robust innovative pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launch as expected in multiple products targeting high-value markets such as livestock immune enhancement, control of parasites in companion animals and pain controls.
We also built a substantial development capability in animal health vaccine, and as demonstrated by our recent offer to acquire Genesis Animal Health business, we will continue to look externally for opportunities to drive growth in this business. 
Finally, you'll see strong 14% volume growth from our human pharma products in the rest of the world line. Emerging market countries represented about three quarters of the sales in Q1, and as a group also registered 14% volume growth. In terms of products, growth in emerging markets countries was driven by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog and Humulin. In terms of geographies, we saw robust growth across the host of geographies in Asia, Latin America and of course, China. 
Given a very small effect of foreign exchange on our results this quarter, we provided our summarized non-GAAP and reported income statements within and without the effect of foreign exchange in our supplementary slides.
Now before I turn the call over to Derek, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. On Slide 11, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of April 11, inclusive of changes since our January 27 earnings call. 
Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 69 to state maybe including 31 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotechnologies represent nearly half of our late stage Phase II and Phase III assets in over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority, as reflected by the arrows on Slide 11 since our January update we have began Phase III testing of  HbA1c for schizophrenia. Bringing our total Phase III portfolio to nine entities. We continue to be on track to meet our goal of having 10 entities in Phase III by the end of the year. Other molecules that could begin Phase III in 2011 include our novel base insulin analogs, our new insulin like products and our IL-17 antibody. 
We also advanced two molecules into Phase II and two in Phase I. Finally, both sBLAs and io-beta antibodies continue early stage development after we terminated clinical trials in their lead indications, and we terminated one molecule in Phase I development.
With this current pipeline and our continued business development effort, our goal is still to launch on average two molecular entities per year beginning in 2013 providing a foundation for future growth. Derica?"

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key pipeline events for the remainder of the year. Having now receive the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon, we look forward to launching the product in Europe later this year. We have a number of other potential regulatory approval this year including: Linagliptin in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And here in the U.S., sBLAs for BPH, Byetta in combination with basal insulin and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer.
Expected regulatory submissions include: our response to the FDA complete response letter for Bydureon; sBLA for Erbitux and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer; and for first-line, non-small cell lung cancer. Byetta in combination with basal insulin in Europe and our response to the FDA complete response letter for Amyvid. 
Upcoming clinical trials data disclosures include: Initial results from the Phase III trial of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advance nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer at ASCO. At the UR Meeting in London in May, we will present data on the two Phase II trials of our vast antibody and rheumatoid arthritis. And lastly, data from a study assessing the safety of Cialis when administered with alpha blockers will be presented in May at the American Association of Neurology Meeting in Washington. 
Just late last month, data from the clinical trial evaluating Dialycell in bandwidth EDN and with signs and symptoms of BPH was presented at the European Association of Eurology.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, Phase III trials could begin this year for our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin Larkin product and for our own anti-IL-17 antibody. 
In terms of our 2011 financial guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we still expect 2011's non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.86 to $4.01 reflects a $0.23 IPR in charge from the BI alliance and $0.06 restructuring charge. The business fundamentals underlying our guidance are essentially unchanged since our last update in January. However, a number of foreign currencies, in particular, the euro, have appreciated in recent months. 
As a result, we're updating our revenue growth and growth margin percentage guidance. Assuming rates remain at current levels, we now expect 2011 revenue to grow in the low single digits. And we expect 2011 gross margins, as a percent of revenues to decline by approximately 3 percentage points. Also, we're now estimating that the 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 21% on a reported basis. Both of these rates reflected benefit from the resolution of certain IRS audit matters. In addition, the reported tax rate for the full year reflect the tax benefit of the in-process R&D charge associated with the BI alliance. All other elements of our line item guidance remain unchanged.
Now Slide 14 provides a consolation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010. And the associated growth rate from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. Now in summary, so far, 2011 is playing out as anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial results. With the initiation of Phase III trials for mGlu2/3 for schizophrenia, we now have nine molecules in Phase III development, putting us on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year, with more coming behind. Along with continued business development, this pipeline serves as the foundation of our growth post years.
During Q1, we also made progress on our productivity goals and are in tract to meet our 2011 headcount and expense containment goals. When we discuss our 2011 guidance in detail on the January call, I shared that we faced a number of headwinds this year, as patent exploration, lower sales outside of Japan for first for Gemzar, and later for Zyprexa. U.S. healthcare reform will exact a higher cost this year than it did in 2010, and we'll face some near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. 
I also shared that we expect to see continued strong performance in the rest of our business. We did see the negative impact in Q1 of these items, and we delivered strong growth in the rest of our business as promised. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 10%, operating expense growth of 7% and low double-digit EPS growth. We saw robust revenue growth from our three countercyclical growth engines with Japan growing 41%, Elanco growing 28% and emerging markets growing 15%.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline and on speeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post years YZ. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please?"

And then in terms of pricing, do keep in mind that the DURATION-6 trial was against the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza. Rough numbers in many of the European numbers it would appear that the 1.2 was launched out roughly parity to Byetta, which means that the 1.8 would be the substantial premium. So as we enter those discussions with pricing authorities in Europe, we'll be looking at the full and half duration trials that we have very strong data against insulin enlarging, against lactose, against ingenuity and against Byetta, all of which have a price that's out in the marketplace. Then as you mentioned, Jami, we'll also have the DURATION-6 data against the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza that we enter in both discussions as well.

So at current rate, if you have a very unfavorable compare until the Q3 number. And then actually we've put them to having a modest division booked to cost of sales in the fourth quarter. Hope that helps. Brad, next call please."

So we're slightly off from the bottom line. So the industry average is somewhere on the margin line between 20% and 25%. So Janssen is in that lower on in that range. We would be in that range as well. When you step back and look at the business though, I think why we're quite excited about going forward. First, Janssen does give us more of a global footprint, gives us more capability inside of Europe. As well, as we got a hundred pending registrations so different products across all the countries internationally. It was a very or can business we're going to take global. And then kind of a macro level, how we're going to continue to see margin improvement and above industry growth rate in Elanco is just looking at the three big areas in animal health, there's higher margin, companion animals, we're about 10%, the industry is at 40%; Europe, we're about 10%, 11% exactly. And the industry is about 30%; and vaccines we're very small with our Pfizer acquisition and the industry is about 25%. So we see tremendous upside at higher-margin areas in these three segments. So that's what gives us a lot of optimism and growth as we go forward the next three to five years in Animal Health."

Joining me today are our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; our President of Elanco Animal Health, Jeff Simmons; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations. 
Today's Q1 earnings call coincides with our annual shareholder meeting. As a result, our CEO, John Lechleiter is not available to participate in today's call. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Since the Q4 earnings call in late January, we've continued to bolster our operations through business development, to leverage our marketed products and to advance our pipeline. We announced our offer to acquire the Animal Health business of Janssen Pharmaceutica from Johnson & Johnson. This business is primarily European-focused, targeting disease segments in companion animals and livestock, with special emphasis on swine and poultry. Upon deal closing, which is expected by mid-year, we would obtain a portfolio of roughly 50 marketed Animal Health products. 
Here in the U.S., we began active promotion for Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and we launched Axiron, the first and only testosterone replacement therapy applied to the underarm. On the regulatory front, we submitted our response to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for the use of Erbitux in first-line head and neck cancer. 
We received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for florbetapir, our PET imaging agent being studied for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque. We are working closely with the FDA to address their questions on the reader training program to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of beta-amyloid plaque images. 
Late last week, we also received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for liprotamase, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and we'll be working diligently to address the agency's questions.
In Europe, we submitted our application for the use of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer. And also in Europe, we recently received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Based on this recommendation, we anticipate receiving EC approval by late June.
On the clinical front, we disclosed positive top line results for the Phase II trial of the once-monthly formulation of exenatide. We plan to meet with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps for this program. We also disclosed top line results of the Phase III DURATION-6 trial comparing Bydureon to the highest approved dose of Victoza. Bydureon demonstrated a robust reduction on HbA1c from baseline. However, it did not meet the primary endpoint of noninferiority to Victoza 1.8 milligram in the reduction of HbA1c. Additional data from the trial is planned to be disclosed at a later date. And we began the first Phase III trial for our mGlu2/3 prodrug for schizophrenia. 
Lastly, on the legal front, Lilly received a favorable ruling on the Cymbalta patent challenge. Wockhardt voluntarily consented to entry of judgment in favor of Lilly on all pending issues, which the judge so ordered. The judge asked the remaining parties to indicate if they intend to proceed to trial and all nine defendants failed to indicate that they intend to proceed. As a result, we remain of the view that there will be no generic duloxetine product coming to market until the Cymbalta patent expires. However, a trial date remained on the court's docket for June of this year. A meeting with the court, Lilly and the defendants will be held later this month to determine next steps in this litigation.
While not specific to Lilly, perhaps one of the most notable events since our last earnings call was the disaster in Japan caused by the March 11 earthquake and its aftermath. Because Japan is such a big part of our growth strategy, I'd like to provide you with some details. First and foremost, we were relieved that within hours we were able to account for the safety of all Lilly Japan employees. We're also proud of the support, both monetary and product donations that Lilly Japan, the Lilly Foundation and Eli Lilly & Co. have provided to help those affected by this strategy. 
From a business perspective, our Japanese affiliate headquarters and development center of excellence are located in Kobe, and we have a manufacturing plant in Seishin just outside of Kobe. These operations are approximately 500 miles southwest of the disaster zone. As a result, we had no damages or other issues at these sites.
In terms of product supply, we've encountered no issues getting manufacturing products into or out of Japan. And we have not had and do not anticipate having any issue with the supply of raw materials, intermediate or finished product from our Japanese suppliers. Prior to the earthquake, we had robust inventory levels throughout our supply chain for materials sourced from Japan. 
In terms of domestic sales, we did receive what appeared to have been precautionary orders from customers totaling $30 million to $35 million in the quarter. We expect that this will wash out in future quarters. 
Our thoughts are with the Japanese people in what will surely be a long and difficult recovery. We'll continue to provide them our support, and we'll continue to ensure that Lilly products reach the patients who need them. 
Now at this background, Ronika will discuss our Q1 financial results and provide our pipeline update, and Derica will cover key events for the remainder of 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"
285467,97242184,115502,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2011",2011-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As we've done on our previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment",1027,"Thanks, Phil. As we've done on our previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 7 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement.
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated solid revenue growth of 6% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effect of the U.S. health care reform, revenue would have grown 10%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 79.5% to 79.8%. 
Operating expenses defined as a sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. Drivers for the increase included: higher administrative expenses, driven by the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with the U.S. health care reform and higher litigation expenses; higher marketing and selling expenses driven by o U.S. investments primarily in the emerging markets; and higher R&D expense due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trials expenses.
In addition, both SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to the BI [Boehringer Ingelheim] alliance. Excluding the effect of U.S. health care reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would have grown 7%. Other income and deductions was a net expense this year compared to net income last year. You may remember that we had substantial income in Q1 2010 related to the recovery of damages from generic olanzapine marketers in Germany and from gains on the sales of securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter, considerably lower than 27.3% from last year's Q1. Last year's Q1 rate included an $85.1 million charge related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy and did not benefit from the R&D tax credit as it had left. This year, we did benefit from the R&D tax credit, as well as from the resolution of certain IRS tax matters. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased 5% to $1.24. As indicated, Lilly provided the 2011 guidance in January, we felt robust EPS growth in our business in Q1 excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of the Gemzar patent exploration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would have grown low double digits. 
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement while Slide 9 provides reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 revenue. As you can see on Slide 10, total revenue growth of 6% was driven by solid volume growth of 5% and foreign exchange contributing the remaining 1%. Price had no impact on the worldwide revenue growth. We continue to see strong volume growth from our three countercyclical growth engines: Japan, Elanco Animal Health and Emerging Markets. 
Volume growth in Japan was 34% driven by recent launches of Cymbalta and FORTEO, as well as continued strong growth of Alimta, Zyprexa, Gemzar and Humalog. In addition, roughly 1/4 quarter of the Q1 volume growth was attributable to precautionary buying Phil mentioned earlier; Elanco Animal Health volume growth of 25% in Q1 driven by the increased demand for food animal products globally, as well as by the launch of Trifexis in the U.S. and the acquisition of certain European Animal Health assets from Pfizer. 
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Comfortis. In addition, Elanco has a robust innovative pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launches expected in multiple products targeting high-value markets such as livestock immune enhancements, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. We also built a substantial development capability in Animal Health vaccines, and as demonstrated by our recent offer to acquire Janssen's Animal Health business, we will continue to look externally for opportunities to drive growth in this business. 
Finally, you'll see strong 14% volume growth from our Human Pharma [Human Pharmaceuticals] products in the rest of the world lines. Emerging market countries represented about 3/4 of the sales in Q1, and as a group also registered 14% volume growth. In terms of products, growth in emerging market countries was driven by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog and Humulin. In terms of geographies, we saw robust growth across the host of geographies in Asia, Latin America and of course, China. 
Given the very small effect of foreign exchange on our results this quarter, we provided our summarized non-GAAP and reported income statements with and without the effect of foreign exchange in our supplementary slides.
Now before I turn the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. On Slide 11, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of April 11, inclusive of changes since our January 27 earnings call. 
Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 69 distinct NMEs including 31 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotechnology will represent nearly half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets in over 1/3 of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority, as reflected by the arrows on Slide 11. Since our January update, we have began Phase III testing of mGlu2/3 for schizophrenia, bringing our total Phase III portfolio to nine NMEs. We continue to be on track to meet our goal of having 10 NMEs in Phase III by the end of the year. Other molecules that could begin Phase III in 2011 include our novel basal insulin analogs, our new insulin glargine product and our IL-17 antibody. 
We also advanced two molecules into Phase II and two into Phase I. Finally, both tasisulam and IL-1ß antibodies continued earlier stage development after we terminated clinical trials in their lead indications, and we terminated one molecule in Phase I development.
With this current pipeline and our continued business development effort, our goal is still to launch on average two molecular entities per year beginning in 2013 providing a foundation for future growth. Derica?"

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key pipeline events for the remainder of the year. Having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon, we look forward to launching the product",839,"Thanks, Ronika. To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key pipeline events for the remainder of the year. Having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon, we look forward to launching the product in Europe later this year. We have a number of other potential regulatory approvals this year including: linagliptin in the U.S., Europe and Japan; and here in the U.S., Cialis for DPH, Byetta in combination with basal insulin and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer.
Expected regulatory submissions include: our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Bydureon; sBLA for Erbitux in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer and for first-line, non-small cell lung cancer; Byetta in combination with basal insulin in Europe; and our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Amyvid. 
Upcoming clinical trial data disclosures include initial results from the Phase III trial of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer at ASCO. At the EULAR meeting in London in May, we will present data on the two Phase II trials of our BAFF antibody and rheumatoid arthritis. And lastly, data from a study assessing the safety of Cialis when co-administered with alpha blockers will be presented in May at the American Association of Urology meeting in Washington. 
Just late last month, data from the clinical trial evaluating tadalafil in men with ED and with signs and symptoms of BPH was presented at the European Association of Urology.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, Phase III trials could begin this year for our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and for our own anti-IL-17 antibody. 
In terms of our 2011 financial guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we still expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.86 to $4.01 reflects a $0.23 IPR&D charge from the BI alliance and the $0.06 restructuring charge. 
The business fundamentals underlying our guidance are essentially unchanged since our last update in January. However, a number of foreign currencies, in particular, the euro, have appreciated in recent months. As a result, we're updating our revenue growth and gross margin percent guidance. Assuming rates remain at current levels, we now expect 2011 revenue to grow in the low single digits. And we expect 2011 gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by approximately 3 percentage point. 
Also, we're now estimating that the 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. Both of these rates reflected benefit from the resolution of certain IRS audit matters. In addition, the reported tax rate for the full year reflects the tax benefit of the in-process R&D charge associated with the BI alliance. All other elements of our line item guidance remain unchanged.
Now Slide 14 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 And the associated growth rate from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. 
Now in summary, so far, 2011 is playing out as anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial results. With the initiation of Phase III trials for mGlu2/3 for schizophrenia, we now have nine molecules in Phase III development, putting us on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year, with more coming behind. Along with continued business development, this pipeline serves as the foundation of our growth post years ZY.
During Q1, we also made progress on our productivity goals and are in tract to meet our 2011 headcount and expense containment goals. When we discussed our 2011 guidance in detail on the January call, I shared that we face a number of headwinds this year, as patent expirations will lower sales outside of Japan for first for Gemzar and later for Zyprexa. U.S. health care reform will exact a higher cost this year than it did in 2010, and we'll face some near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. 
I also shared that we expect to see continued strong performance in the rest of our business. We did see the negative impact in Q1 of these items, and we delivered strong growth in the rest of our business as promised. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 10%, operating expense growth of 7% and low double-digit EPS growth. We saw robust revenue growth from our three countercyclical growth engines with Japan growing 41%, Elanco growing 28% and Emerging Markets growing 15%.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on: delivering strong financial results, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline, and on speeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post Years YZ. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please?"

And then in terms of pricing, do keep in mind that the DURATION-6 trial was against the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza. Rough numbers in many of the European numbers, it would appear that the 1.2 was launched at roughly parity to Byetta, which means that the 1.8 would be the substantial premium. So as we enter those discussions with pricing authorities in Europe, we'll be looking at the full raft of DURATION trials where we have very strong data against insulin glargine, against ACTOS, against Januvia and against Byetta, all of which have a price that's out in the marketplace.

In the U.S., we did see a level of destocking on the part of wholesalers. And as best as we can tell, even at the retail level as well in the first quarter. So that destocking served to dampen our revenue growth in the U.S. in Q1. At the same time, given the disaster that we all witnessed in Japan, we saw a buy-in on the part of wholesalers or distributors there in the case of emergency. And that buy-in Japan was probably in the range of around $30 million to $35 million in the quarter. So it was -- of the 41% of Japan growth that we saw in the quarter, about 25% of that was related to this buy-in. As it relates to your third question around the Avid acquisition -- just a reminder to everyone, when we did the Avid acquisition, it was solely based upon the prospect of that compound itself.

Having these three agents, it's actually an opportunity, not a problem. First of all, the oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor partnered with Incyte could be I think a very competitive agent in relation to Pfizer's recent Phase III agent which have received so much attention, tofacitinib, with a positive recent data. We are currently exploring them, the JAK1/JAK2 component Phase IIb in relation to those safety and efficacy. Oral agents will be placed earlier most likely than in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, completing with methotrexate as a key initial agent. Our two biologicals, the anti-BAFF and IL-17 represents very novel agents with new mechanism to influence then the immune system; the BAFF against that B-cells and the IL-17 more as an inflammatory cytokine that is released. And both of these agents have positive Phase II data in rheumatoid arthritis, and they will be positioned then in patients that actually are failing to TNF. And we know that there is substantial proportion of patients, up to 50%, that don't respond well enough to TNF blockers. And even if you then can switch to another TNF agent, the efficacy goes away with time.

We based this on our Phase I data but also, we're actually at the clause of the competitor molecules both from Merck and Roche, as you know are moving ahead with Phase III trials. We feel we have a competitive agent based on what we have seen so far, what area is then to avoid the problems that Pfizer had with the torcetrapib, mainly the increasing blood pressure. We have not seen this for our compound, and we are enthusiastically moving it forward, I think, we can say currently.

I think if you look in the Q, you'll actually find it was $62.4 million was the number. So it turned about 1 percentage point off of the U.S. revenue growth rate, about 0.5 percentage point off of the worldwide growth rate for the quarter. And then in terms of the doughnut hole, I think there may be different practices at the various companies. You may; want to check on this. But essentially for the doughnut hole, we've done our best to try to model. We think we'll actually be occurring. In other words, the charge that we would have recognized in Q1 would assume that a whole host of people would not yet have hit the doughnut hole during this quarter. And if you look at approximately $90 million for the year and compared to $400 million to $500 million for the year, you'll see that assumes a bump-up in Q2 through 4 compared to Q1. That bump-up is due to the higher expected charge that we'll be recognizing for the doughnut hole, as more seniors and Medicare hit that part of the benefit from U.S. health care reform."

We'll have probably late this year, at the best maybe early next year, the opportunity to present the 12-month safety data from that trial. So that's sort of would be the next major data readout that I would point you to for mGlu2/3. And then in terms of the gross margin percent dynamics. With the strengthening of foreign currency here in the first quarter particularly of the euro, we would expect that for the full year, we have a substantial additional cost booked to cost of sales from this FX impact on international inventories sold. If you recall, there were some pretty different dynamics last year, quarter-by-quarter. Probably the best thing I can do is point you to Slide 17 in the supplemental portion of our slide deck for the day, where at the bottom you'll see for each discreet quarter how much FX affected gross margin in those particular quarters for the year. At a high level, we had a modest benefit to cost of sales booked Q2 last year, a significant benefit to cost of sales booked in Q3, so at current rates, you have a very unfavorable compare to the Q3 number. And then actually we've flipped then to having a modest addition booked to cost of sales in the fourth quarter. Hope that helps."

So Janssen's on the lower end of that range, and we would be in that range as well. When you step back and look at the business though, I think why we're quite excited about going forward: First, Janssen does give us more of a global footprint, gives us more capability inside of Europe, as well as we've got a hundred pending registrations of different products across all the countries internationally. So it was a very European business we're going to take global. And then at kind of a macro level, how we're going to continue to see margin improvement. And above industry growth rates in Elanco is just looking at the three big areas: in Animal Health, where there's higher margin; companion animals, we're at about 10%, the industry is at 40%; Europe, we're at about 10%, 11% exactly, and the industry is about 30%; and vaccines we're very small with our Pfizer acquisition and the industry is about 25%. So we see tremendous upside at higher-margin areas in these three segments.

Joining me today are our Chief Financial officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; our President of Elanco Animal Health, Jeff Simmons; and Ronika Pletcher; and Jill Thoren from Investor Relations. 
Today's Q1 earnings call coincides with our annual shareholder meeting. As a result, our CEO, John Lechleiter is not available to participate in today's call. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Since the Q4 earnings call in late January, we've continued to bolster our operations through business development, to leverage our marketed products and to advance our pipeline. We announced our offer to acquire the Animal Health business of Janssen Pharmaceutica from Johnson & Johnson. This business is primarily European-focused, targeting disease segments in companion animals and livestock, with special emphasis on swine and poultry. Upon deal closing, which is expected by mid-year, we would obtain a portfolio of roughly 50 marketed Animal Health products. 
Here in the U.S., we began active promotion for Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and we launched Axiron, the first and only testosterone replacement therapy applied to the underarm. On the regulatory front, we submitted our response to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for the use of Erbitux in first-line head and neck cancer. 
We received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for florbetapir, our PET imaging agent being studied for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque. We are working closely with the FDA to address their questions on the reader training program to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of beta-amyloid plaque images. 
Late last week, we also received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for liprotamase, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and we'll be working diligently to address the agency's questions.
In Europe, we submitted our application for the use of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer. And also in Europe, we recently received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Based on this recommendation, we anticipate receiving EC approval by late June.
On the clinical front, we disclosed positive top line results for the Phase II trial of the once-monthly formulation of exenatide. We plan to meet with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps for this program. We also disclosed top line results of the Phase III DURATION-6 trial comparing Bydureon to the highest approved dose of Victoza. Bydureon demonstrated a robust reduction in HbA1c from baseline. However, it did not meet the primary endpoint of noninferiority to Victoza 1.8 milligram in the reduction of HbA1c. Additional data from the trial is planned to be disclosed at a later date. And we began the first Phase III trial for our mGlu2/3 prodrug for schizophrenia. 
Lastly, on the legal front, Lilly received a favorable ruling on the Cymbalta patent challenge. Wockhardt voluntarily consented to entry of judgment in favor of Lilly on all pending issues, which the judge so ordered. The judge asked the remaining parties to indicate if they intend to proceed to trial and all nine defendants failed to indicate that they intend to proceed. As a result, we remain of the view that there will be no generic duloxetine product coming to market until the Cymbalta patent expires. However, a trial date remained on the court's docket for June of this year. A meeting with the court, Lilly and the defendants will be held later this month to determine next steps in this litigation.
While not specific to Lilly, perhaps one of the most notable events since our last earnings call was the disaster in Japan caused by the March 11 earthquake and its aftermath. Because Japan is such a big part of our growth strategy, I'd like to provide you with some details. First and foremost, we were relieved that within hours we were able to account for the safety of all Lilly Japan employees. We're also proud of the support, both monetary and product donations that Lilly Japan, the Lilly Foundation and Eli Lilly & Co. have provided to help those affected by this strategy. 
From a business perspective, our Japanese affiliate headquarters and development center of excellence are located in Kobe, and we have a manufacturing plant in Seishin just outside of Kobe. These operations are approximately 500 miles southwest of the disaster zone. As a result, we had no damages or other issues at these sites.
In terms of product supply, we've encountered no issues getting manufacturing products into or out of Japan. And we have not had and do not anticipate having any issue with the supply of raw materials, intermediate or finished product from our Japanese suppliers. Prior to the earthquake, we had robust inventory levels throughout our supply chain for materials sourced from Japan. 
In terms of domestic sales, we did receive what appeared to have been precautionary orders from customers totaling $30 million to $35 million in the quarter. We expect that this will wash out in future quarters. 
Our thoughts are with the Japanese people in what will surely be a long and difficult recovery. We'll continue to provide them our support, and we'll continue to ensure that Lilly products reach the patients who need them. 
Now with this background, Ronika will discuss our Q1 financial results and provide our pipeline update, and Derica will cover key events for the remainder of 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"

This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 7 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement.
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated solid revenue growth of 6% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effect of U.S. health care reform, revenue would have grown 10%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 79.5% to 79.8%. 
Operating expenses defined as a sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. Drivers for the increase included: higher administrative expenses, driven by the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform and higher litigation expenses; higher marketing and selling expenses driven by o U.S. investments primarily in the emerging markets; and higher R&D expense due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trials expenses.
In addition, both SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to the BI [Boehringer Ingelheim] alliance. Excluding the effect of U.S. health care reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would have grown 7%. Other income and deductions was a net expense this year compared to net income last year. You may remember that we had substantial income in Q1 2010 related to the recovery of damages from generic olanzapine marketers in Germany and from gains on the sales of securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter, considerably lower than 27.3% from last year's Q1. Last year's Q1 rate included an $85.1 million charge related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy and did not benefit from the R&D tax credit as it had lapsed. This year, we did benefit from the R&D tax credit, as well as from the resolution of certain IRS tax matters. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased 5% to $1.24. As indicated, Lilly provided the 2011 guidance in January, we felt robust EPS growth in our business in Q1 excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of the Gemzar patent exploration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would have grown low double digits. 
Slide 8 shows our reported income statement while Slide 9 provides reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 revenue. As you can see on Slide 10, total revenue growth of 6% was driven by solid volume growth of 5% and foreign exchange contributing the remaining 1%. Price had no impact on the worldwide revenue growth. We continue to see strong volume growth from our three countercyclical growth engines: Japan, Elanco Animal Health and Emerging Markets. 
Volume growth in Japan was 34% driven by recent launches of Cymbalta and FORTEO, as well as continued strong growth of Alimta, Zyprexa, Gemzar and Humalog. In addition, roughly 1/4 quarter of the Q1 volume growth was attributable to precautionary buying Phil mentioned earlier; Elanco Animal Health volume growth of 25% in Q1 driven by the increased demand for food animal products globally, as well as by the launch of Trifexis in the U.S. and the acquisition of certain European Animal Health assets from Pfizer. 
Going forward, we expect Animal Health revenue growth to benefit from international launches of Comfortis. In addition, Elanco has a robust innovative pipeline and is poised to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years with launches expected in multiple products targeting high-value markets such as livestock immune enhancements, control of parasites in companion animals and pain control. We also built a substantial development capability in Animal Health vaccines, and as demonstrated by our recent offer to acquire Janssen's Animal Health business, we will continue to look externally for opportunities to drive growth in this business. 
Finally, you'll see strong 14% volume growth from our Human Pharma [Human Pharmaceuticals] products in the rest of the world lines. Emerging market countries represented about 3/4 of the sales in Q1, and as a group also registered 14% volume growth. In terms of products, growth in emerging market countries was driven by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog and Humulin. In terms of geographies, we saw robust growth across the host of geographies in Asia, Latin America and of course, China. 
Given the very small effect of foreign exchange on our results this quarter, we provided our summarized non-GAAP and reported income statements with and without the effect of foreign exchange in our supplementary slides.
Now before I turn the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. On Slide 11, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of April 11, inclusive of changes since our January 27 earnings call. 
Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 69 distinct NMEs including 31 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotech molecules represent nearly half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets in over 1/3 of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority, as reflected by the arrows on Slide 11. Since our January update, we have began Phase III testing of mGlu2/3 for schizophrenia, bringing our total Phase III portfolio to nine NMEs. We continue to be on track to meet our goal of having 10 NMEs in Phase III by the end of the year. Other molecules that could begin Phase III in 2011 include our novel basal insulin analogs, our new insulin glargine product and our IL-17 antibody. 
We also advanced two molecules into Phase II and two into Phase I. Finally, both tasisulam and IL-1ß antibodies continued earlier stage development after we terminated clinical trials in their lead indications, and we terminated one molecule in Phase I development.
With this current pipeline and our continued business development efforts, our goal is still to launch on average two molecular entities per year beginning in 2013 providing a foundation for future growth. Derica?"

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key pipeline events for the remainder of the year. Having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon, we look forward to launching the product",839,"Thanks, Ronika. To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key pipeline events for the remainder of the year. Having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of Bydureon, we look forward to launching the product in Europe later this year. We have a number of other potential regulatory approvals this year including: linagliptin in the U.S., Europe and Japan; and here in the U.S., Cialis for BPH, Byetta in combination with basal insulin and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer.
Expected regulatory submissions include: our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Bydureon; sBLA for Erbitux in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer and for first-line, non-small cell lung cancer; Byetta in combination with basal insulin in Europe; and our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Amyvid. 
Upcoming clinical trial data disclosures include initial results from the Phase III trial of Alimta induction treatment followed by Alimta maintenance treatment in advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer at ASCO. At the EULAR meeting in London in May, we will present data on the two Phase II trials of our BAFF antibody and rheumatoid arthritis. And lastly, data from a study assessing the safety of Cialis when co-administered with alpha blockers will be presented in May at the American Association of Urology meeting in Washington. 
Just late last month, data from the clinical trial evaluating tadalafil in men with ED and with signs and symptoms of BPH was presented at the European Association of Urology.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, Phase III trials could begin this year for our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product and for our own anti-IL-17 antibody. 
In terms of our 2011 financial guidance. As you've seen in our press release, we still expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.30. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.86 to $4.01 reflects a $0.23 IPR&D charge from the BI alliance and the $0.06 restructuring charge. 
The business fundamentals underlying our guidance are essentially unchanged since our last update in January. However, a number of foreign currencies, in particular, the euro, have appreciated in recent months. As a result, we're updating our revenue growth and gross margin percent guidance. Assuming rates remain at current levels, we now expect 2011 revenue to grow in the low single digits. And we expect 2011 gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by approximately 3 percentage point. 
Also, we're now estimating that the 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. Both of these rates reflected benefit from the resolution of certain IRS audit matters. In addition, the reported tax rate for the full year reflects the tax benefit of the in-process R&D charge associated with the BI alliance. All other elements of our line item guidance remain unchanged.
Now Slide 14 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. 
Now in summary, so far, 2011 is playing out as anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial results. With the initiation of Phase III trials for mGlu2/3 for schizophrenia, we now have nine molecules in Phase III development, putting us on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year, with more coming behind. Along with continued business development, this pipeline serves as the foundation of our growth post years YZ.
During Q1, we also made progress on our productivity goals and are in tract to meet our 2011 headcount and expense containment goals. When we discussed our 2011 guidance in detail on the January call, I shared that we face a number of headwinds this year, as patent expirations will lower sales outside of Japan for first for Gemzar and later for Zyprexa. U.S. health care reform will exact a higher cost this year than it did in 2010, and we'll face some near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. 
I also shared that we expect to see continued strong performance in the rest of our business. We did see the negative impact in Q1 of these items, and we delivered strong growth in the rest of our business as promised. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 10%, operating expense growth of 7% and low double-digit EPS growth. We saw robust revenue growth from our three countercyclical growth engines with Japan growing 41%, Elanco growing 28% and Emerging Markets growing 15%.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on: delivering strong financial results, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline, and on speeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post years YZ. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please?"

And then in terms of pricing, do keep in mind that the DURATION-6 trial was against the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza. Rough numbers in many of the European markets, it would appear that the 1.2 was launched at roughly parity to Byetta, which means that the 1.8 would be the substantial premium. So as we enter those discussions with pricing authorities in Europe, we'll be looking at the full raft of DURATION trials where we have very strong data against insulin glargine, against ACTOS, against Januvia and against Byetta, all of which have a price that's out in the marketplace. And then as you're mentioning, Jami, we'll also have the DURATION-6 data against the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza that we'll enter into those discussions as well.

Having these three agents, it's actually an opportunity, not a problem. First of all, the oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor partnered with Incyte could be I think a very competitive agent in relation to Pfizer's recent Phase III agent which have received so much attention, tofacitinib, with a positive recent data. We are currently exploring them, the JAK1/JAK2 component Phase IIb in relation to dose safety and efficacy. Oral agents will be placed earlier most likely than in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, competing with methotrexate as a key initial agent. Our two biologicals, the anti-BAFF and IL-17 represents very novel agents with new mechanist to influence then the immune system; the BAFF against that B-cells and the IL-17 more as an inflammatory cytokine that is released. And both of these agents have positive Phase II data in rheumatoid arthritis, and they will be positioned then in patients that actually are failing to TNF. And we know that there is substantial proportion of patients, up to 50%, that don't respond well enough to TNF blockers. And even if you then can switch to another TNF agent, the efficacy goes away with time. So we see both the BAFF and the IL-17 as potential new treatment options in actually quite a large patient population that have been failing TNF agents."

So it turned about 1 percentage point off of the U.S. revenue growth rate and about 0.5 percentage point off of our worldwide growth rate for the quarter. And then in terms of the doughnut hole, I think there may be different practices at the various companies. You may want to check on this. But essentially for the doughnut hole, we've done our best to try to model. We think will actually be occurring. In other words, the charge that we would have recognized in Q1 would assume that a whole host of people would not yet have hit the doughnut hole during this quarter. And if you look at the approximately $90 million for the year and compare it to $400 million to $500 million for the full year, you'll see that assumes a bump-up in Q2 through 4 compared to Q1.

I guess, based on your new guidance, it looks like you have an average somewhere between 77%, 78% for the remainder of this year. I guess is there any one quarter that's going to be seeing a disproportionate hit from FX? And then also, just going -- it's an earlier question, are you anticipating a meaningful drop in fourth quarter gross margins as the generic Zyprexa impact ramps? Second question just was -- can you also just, with the mGlu, walk through the timeline and the scope of that Phase III program? And in that answer, would you also touch on any incremental data that might be requested by the FDA to address some of the basic earlier seizure data points the products saw that might be included in that Phase III program?

The one thing I would highlight is Ronika had mentioned, the presentation earlier this year of the 6-month safety data. We'll have probably late this year, at the best maybe early next year, the opportunity to present the 12-month safety data from that trial. So that will sort of be the next major data readout that I would point you to for mGlu2/3. And then in terms of the gross margin percent dynamics. With the strengthening of foreign currencies here in the first quarter particularly of the euro, we would expect for the full year, we would have a substantial additional cost booked to cost of sales from this FX impact on international inventories sold. If you recall, there were some pretty different dynamics last year, quarter-by-quarter. Probably the best thing I can do is point you to Slide 17 in the supplemental portion of our slide deck for today, where at the bottom you'll see for each discreet quarter how much FX affected gross margin in those particular quarters for the year. At a high level, we had a modest benefit to cost of sales booked Q2 last year, a significant benefit to cost of sales booked in Q3, so at current rates, you have a very unfavorable compare to the Q3 number. And then actually we've flipped then to having a modest addition booked to cost of sales in the fourth quarter. Hope that helps."

So we're slightly off from the bottom line. So the industry average is somewhere on the margin line between 20% and 25%. So Janssen's on the lower end of that range, and we would be in that range as well. When you step back and look at the business though, I think why we're quite excited about going forward: First, Janssen does give us more of a global footprint, gives us more capability inside of Europe, as well as we've got a hundred pending registrations of different products across all the countries internationally. So it was a very European business we're going to take global. And then at kind of a macro level, how we're going to continue to see margin improvement and above industry growth rates in Elanco is just looking at the three big areas: in Animal Health, where there's higher margin; companion animals, we're at about 10%, the industry is at 40%; Europe, we're at about 10%, 11% exactly, and the industry is about 30%; and vaccines we're very small with our Pfizer acquisition and the industry is at about 25%. So we see tremendous upside at higher-margin areas in these three segments. So that's what gives us some -- a lot of optimism and growth as we go forward the next three to five years in Animal Health."

Since we just provided a comprehensive overview of our business at our investment community meeting on June 30, today, we'll limit our prepared remarks leaving more time for the Q&A session. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Since the Q1 earnings call in April, we've had a number of significant events, many of them in our diabetes business. On the regulatory front, we had important news for Bydureon. The European commission granted final approval of Bydureon, the long acting formula of and the first treatment for adults with Type 2 Diabetes. We launched in the U.K. last week and launches in other European countries expected over the course of 2011 in the first half of 2012. We submitted Bydureon to regulatory authorities in Japan and along with Amylin, we completed thorough Q3 study to support the U.S. M.B.A. for Bydureon. In this study, when administered at and above therapeutic levels, except I did not prolong the expected QT interval in healthy individuals. Further, the study found no relationship between QTc interval and plasma exenatide concentrations. we've had to submit our reply to the FDA Complete Response Letter in Q3.
We also had quite a bit of regulatory news on the. The FDA approval under the training project for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the product here in the U.S. in May. Presenting the first DPP4 inhibitor to be approved at 1 dosage strength with no those adjusted recommended for patients with kidney or liver impairment.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and welfare approved linagliptin under the trade name. Along with the eye, we expect to launch the product in Japan later this quarter.
Continuing the string of rapid approvals, regulatory authorities in Mexico and Brazil also proved linagliptin known there as Trayenta. and launches in these countries are also expected in Q3.
In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of agenda and we expect final EC  approval later this quarter. Clearly, we're very pleased with the significant progress achieved during Q2 in our diabetes business.
In non-diabetes regulatory news, along with Bristol-Myers Squib, we submitted the SPLA for Erbitux and first-line non-small cell lung cancer. On the clinical content at ASCO, we presented positive data from PARAMOUNT, the second study to evaluate the use of Alimta's maintenance therapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And the first study to evaluate the use of continuation maintenance with Alimta following first-line Alimta platinum therapy. Based on data from PARAMOUNT, we submitted our dossier in Europe earlier this year and we plan to submit here in the U.S. once we have more mature overall survival data.
On the Business Development front, we received final EC approval for and finally closed on our acquisition of animal health business. We signed an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with since these on which the 2 companies will jointly develop site-specific bone healing products. The companies will also conduct and fund the evaluation of additional orthopedic uses for Forteo. In addition to the development component of the agreement, the collaboration includes the co-promotion of Forteo to orthopedic surgeons in the U.S. and in select U.S. countries.
We signed agreements with private investors to establish  BioCritica. Based in Indianapolis, BioCritica initially focus in the development of
Diacritical acquired the U.S. development commercialization rights to Xigris and will also receive the rights to potentially acquire several critical care compounds currently in pre-something developer. The collaboration of the agreement also includes an option for BioCritica to acquire the development and commercialization rights to Xigris outside the U.S. at a later date.
We entered into a collaboration with Medtronic to research and development new approach to treating Parkinson's disease that involves delivering a potential new medicine to the brain using implantable drug delivery system. Specifically, the goal of the collaboration is to develop a therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease that combines the strengths of Lily's biologic, a modified form of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor with Medtronic's implantable drug infusion system technology. Lastly on the legal front, the Supreme Court denied release petition to reconsider a federal appeals court ruling invalidated something GEMZAR abuse patent. And to judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ordered all generic drug manufacturers challenging the validity of the compound for Cymbalta to sell a generic version of until the patent expires. As a result, we do not expect to market duloxetine in the market until patent expires in June 2013th or December 2013 if we're successful in obtaining the six-month pediatric exclusivity.
Now as a background, Veronica will discuss our Q2 financial results and provide our pipeline update; and Derica will then cover key events to our major 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"

As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comment to non-GAAP results underlined Henson our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 6 wi",1171,"Thanks, Phil. As we've done in previous calls, we'll focus our comment to non-GAAP results underlined Henson our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q2 income statement. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth of 9% this quarter. Excluding GEMZAR outside of Japan and the effective view of health reform, revenue would've grown 13%. Compared to Q2 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points, but were are still strong at 80.4%. This decrease is entirely due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on inventories international inventories sold. Operating expenses defined as a sum of R&D and SG&A grew 12% this quarter. This increase is driven primarily by SG&A which increased 15% over increasing R&D was 6%. Drivers of the increase in operating expense included expenses related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rate, higher sales and marketing expenses to support launches of new products and new indications as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. healthcare reform which was roughly $45 million.
Excluding the effective healthcare reform in the BIL alliance, operating expenses would've grown 7%.
Other income and deductions was in net expense of $58 million this quarter which was higher than it was last year. The higher net expense was due to a write-down of the value of the proteinase assets as a result of the FDA Complete Response Letter we received in April in which the agency requested additional clinical data. Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter, or 1.6 percentage points lower than in Q2 2010. This reduction is primarily due to the R&D tax credit that was not in effect during Q2 2010 but was in effect during Q2 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 5% from $1.24 to $1.18.
Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw robust EPS growth in our business in Q2 excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effect of GEMZAR patent expiration should outside of Japan and investments related to the DI diabetes alliance.
Excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
Slide 7 shows our purported income statement while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at foreign exchange in and its effect in our Q2 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 5%. This quarter, foreign exchange contributed to remain 4% while price had virtually no impact on worldwide revenue growth.
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 counter cyclical growth drivers: Japan, Animal Health and emerging markets. Volume growth in Japan was 15% driven by the recent launches of Cymbalta and Forteo. Recall that the Q1 precautionary buying as a result of the Japanese earthquake and its aftermath increased Q1 sales by about $30 million to $35 million. As expected, this was largely worse in Q2 trimming Japan's volume growth this quarter by about 6 percentage points.
Going to Animal Health volume growth were 16% in Q2 driven by the increase of demand for food animal products globally as well as the launch of something in the U.S., the continued expense expansion of our animal business globally and the acquisition of certain European Animal Health assets from Pfizer.
Finally, embedded within the Rest of World line is our emerging markets revenue growth of 11% in volume and 13% over overall. Particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 20% volume and 26% overall.
This quarter, it is worth reviewing the effect of foreign exchange and the rest of our income statement. While FX did not have large effect on EPS growth, it did affect individual line items.
Slide 10 shows the year on year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange currency. The numbers in the first column are the same as those used on the last call on Slide 6. Let's focus on the second column of the numbers which groups out the effect of foreign exchange rate. First you'll see the 5% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that come you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin also grew 5%. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was entirely due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.
In total, operating expenses grew 9% excluding FX. This increase was driven by the DI deal, the launch of new products and indications, and the pharmaceutical industry fees. Since increasing operating Spence exceeded increase in gross margin, operating income declined 3% and EPS declined 4%. You can see that while FX had a material impact on revenue, cost of sales and operating expense, it really almost had no impact on operating income for the EPS of this quarter. So while FX didn't have much of an impact on EPS growth, U.S. healthcare reform, the effect of expiry outside of Japan and the investments related to the DI something certainly did. As mentioned earlier, excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year your growth of these same items in our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new modular and something clinical development as of July 11 inclusive of changes since our April date. Our clinical phase portfolio now stands at 70 including 33 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotech molecules represent over 40% of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as our overall clinical portfolio.
Advancing our pipeline remains our number 1 priority. As reflected by the arrows, you can see that since our April date we received FDA approval for and launched Tadjenta. We've something to assets and phase testing. We advanced an additional 3 assets in the Phase I testing including our basil we expect to begin pivotal trials for this molecule before your ends and we terminated develop of 1 Phase I asset.
As Doctor Lundberg shared during our investment community meeting on June 3rd, we are very pleased with the progress we've made over in a robust, high-quality pipeline with many potential opportunities to advance patient care and diseases with large unmet needs as well as commercial opportunities. We're on track to meet or exceed our goal of having 10 enemies by Phase III of believe that our that our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lily to return to growth post 2014.

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key events for the remainder of the year. As mentioned earlier, having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of linagliptin, we look forward to the European commission approval later this quarter and then launching the product in Europe later this year.
In addition to our successes so far this year, we have a number of other potential regulatory approvals in the U.S. this year including Cialis for BPH; by aide in combination with basal insulin; and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer.
Expect the regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA complete response letter for Bydureon. The FBL 8 for Erbitux and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and our response to the FDA complete response letter for Amyvid.
We continue to expect a chewing of our mid to late stage pipeline as Phase III trials could begin this year for 1, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin something product as well as our anti-IL 17 monoclonal antibody.
Finally, on the legal front, at anytime, we could have rulings from the CAFC on the Strattera patent challenge and from the District Court in Delaware on the Alimta patent challenge. Now you may recall that in the Alimta case, the judge had indicated from the bench that a ruling would be issued in Lily's favor. 
Now in terms of our 2011 financial guidance, we updated the guidance issued in April for a number of factors including: Continued strong volume growth in revenue-driven by our 3 counter cyclical growth engines in our patent protected brands; secondly, stronger foreign currencies which drives up the expected growth rates of revenue, SG&A and R&D; thirdly, very prompt approvals to linagliptin in most markets which driving an increase in expected SG&A spend in 2011 as well as some additional expected revenue; and fourthly, the write-down of the intangible value of liprotamase which is driving higher expected net other expense for the year.
In total, these changes result in an increase in narrowing of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.25 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.85 to $3.95 reflects the $0.23 I charge from the DI alliance and $0.17 in restructuring charges for the first half of the year.
Now these changes resulted in updates that most of the individual line items as well. Revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single-digits while we expect the gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. SG&A growth is now expected to be in the high-single-digits and R&D growth is now expected to be the low-single-digits.
Other income is now forecasted to be a net loss in the range of $100 million to $175 million. We still expect our 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million.
Now Slide 15 provides insulation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011 and the associated with growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance.
In summary, 2011 continues to play out as we had anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline and we're delivering solid financial results. We remain on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year. And as John articulated on June 30, we're seeing promising signs that in addition to increasing in numbers, our mid to late stage pipeline is increasing in quality as well. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation to return to growth post years YZ
We also remain on track to meet our 2011 headcount as expense containment goals helping to create the financial flexibility to invest in our pipeline, our counter cyclical growth engines in current brands, as well as maintain the dividend. In Q2, we saw this impact of the headwinds that we had anticipated when we issued our 2011 financial guidance in January. And when we updated that guidance on our Q1 earnings call in April. These headwinds are: Patent expirations that are lowering sales of GEMZAR outside of Japan; U.S. healthcare reform which is exacting a higher cost this year than it did in 2010; and near-term dilution for our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. While we did see the negative impact in Q2 of these items, we again delivered strong growth in the remainder of our business.
Excluding those 3 items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 13%, operating expense growth of 7%, and high teens EPS growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering solid financial results, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investments in our patent-protected products and our pipeline, and out-speeding the next generation of Lily molecules for the market to provide growth post YZ. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks and we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

As you all know, FE is a universal, once daily anti-platelet while Brilinta is a reversible price daily agent.

But if the U.S. patients in the Effiant an studies did better than. For some, still unclear reason in Brilinta to the U.S. patients actual actually did better on it's a discrepancy for Brilinta to do the whole world data. There is also some dyspnea some of side effects with Brilinta that Effiant doesn't have. So for the moment, I think we have here to effective anti-platelet agents in the whole world populations while in the U.S. population, Effiant did better. And the FTA I think to that interpretation into actually saying that Brilinta should not be used to have a high aspirin dose which clearly Effiant could be used when you have I think the U.S. treatment paradigm today has a high number of high aspirin in combinations. It's actually with Effiant. But overall on your own we need head-to-head studies to really direct comparison. In relation to futility analysis that will come later this year, this is the judgment of the DNC of the benefits risk component they will look clearly at safety as well as futility on efficacy. And this is their judgment. But my interpretation is that since Alzheimer's disease is a very serious disease, there is no real treatment to stop progression of the disease and we don't really know today when would the potential effect start of preventing that amyloid.

So much of the action that you saw in 2010 even was really directed against reducing prices generics and setting up situations where once they stopped at a branded product goes generic, the initial price for those generics will come out lower. You probably permission this in detail but many press in the past, branded price have been lower in Europe than here in the U.S. But actually the generic price will be substantially higher in Europe than here in the U.S. So again, think you're going to see a stronger push to use generics more quickly and more fully as of the markets in the past may have been slow erosion markets."

Since we just provided a comprehensive overview of our business at our investment community meeting on June 30, today, we'll limit our prepared remarks, leaving more time for the Q&A session. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision.
Since the Q1 earnings call in April, we've had a number of significant event, many of them in our diabetes business. On the regulatory front, we had important news for Bydureon. The European Commission granted final approval of BYDUREON, the long-acting formulation of exenatide and the first once-weekly treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. We launched in the U.K. last week, with launches in other European countries expected over the course of 2011 in the first half of 2012. 
We submitted BYDUREON to regulatory authorities in Japan and, along with Amylin, we completed the thorough QT study to support the U.S. NDA for BYDUREON. In the study, when administered at and above therapeutic levels, exenatide did not prolong the corrected QT interval in healthy individuals. Further, the study found no relationship between QTc interval and plasma exenatide concentrations. We intend to submit our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter in Q3.
We also had quite a bit of regulatory news on the linagliptin, the FDA approval of linagliptin, under the trade name Tradjenta, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the product here in the U.S. in May. Presented as the first DPP4 inhibitor to be approved at one dosage strength, with no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with kidney or liver impairment.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (sic) [Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare] approved linagliptin under the trade name Trazenta. Along with the eye [ph], we expect to launch the product in Japan later this quarter. Continuing the string of rapid approvals, regulatory authorities in Mexico and Brazil also approved linagliptin, known there as Trayenta, and launches in these countries are also expected in Q3. In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of Trajenta, and we expect final EC approval later this quarter. Clearly, we're very pleased with the significant progress achieved during Q2 in our diabetes business.
In non-diabetes regulatory news, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we submitted the sBLA for Erbitux in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer. On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented positive data from PARAMOUNT, the second study to evaluate the use of Alimta's maintenance therapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and the first study to evaluate the use of continuation maintenance with Alimta, following first-line Alimta plus cisplatin therapy. Based on data from PARAMOUNT, we submitted our dossier [ph] in Europe earlier this year. And we plan to submit here in the U.S. once we have more mature, overall survival data.
On the business development front, we received final EC approval for and finally closed on our acquisition of Janssen's animal health business. We signed an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with Synthes, under which the 2 companies will jointly develop site-specific bone-healing products. The companies will also conduct and fund the evaluation of additional orthopedic uses for Forteo. In addition to the development component of the agreement, the collaboration includes the co-promotion of Forteo to orthopedic surgeons in the U.S. and in select o U.S. countries.
We signed agreements with private investors to establish  BioCritica. Based in Indianapolis, BioCritica will initially focus on the continued U.S. development and commercialization of Xigris for severe sepsis. BioCritica 
will acquire the U.S. development and commercialization rights to Xigris and will also receive the rights to potentially acquire several critical care compounds currently in pre-clinical development of Lilly. The collaboration agreement also includes an option for BioCritica to acquire the development and commercialization rights to Xigris outside the U.S. at a later date.
We entered into a collaboration with Medtronic to research and development new approach to treating Parkinson's disease that involves delivering a potential new medicine to the brain using an implantable drug delivery system. Specifically, the goal of the collaboration is to develop a therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease that combines the strengths of Lily's biologic, a modified form of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor with Medtronic's implantable drug infusion system technology. 
Lastly on the legal front, the Supreme Court denied Lilly's petition to reconsider a federal appeals court ruling invalidating the Gemzar method of used patent. And the judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ordered all generic drug manufacturers, challenging the validity of the crack compound patent for Cymbalta not to sell a generic version of duloxetine until the patent expires. As a result, we do not expect generic duloxetine come into market until the Cymbalta patent expires in June 2013 or December 2013, if we're successful in obtaining the six-month pediatric exclusivity.
Now as a background, Ronika will discuss our Q2 financial results and provide our pipeline update, and Derica will then cover key events to our major 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"
285467,97242192,144200,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.

This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments an",1198,"Thanks, Phil. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comment on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q2 income statement. 
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth of 9% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effective view of health care reform, revenue would've grown 13%. Compared to Q2 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points but we're still strong at 80.4%. This decrease is entirely due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. 
Operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 12% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 16%, over an increase in R&D with 6%. Drivers of the increase in operating expense include expenses related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, higher sales and marketing expenses to support launches of new products and new indications, as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. health care reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would've grown 7%.
Other income and deductions was in net expense of $58 million this quarter, which was higher than it was last year. The higher net expense was due to a write-down in the value of the liprotamase asset as a result of the FDA Complete Response Letter we received in April, in which the agency requested additional clinical data. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter or 1.6 percentage points lower than in Q2 2010. This reduction is primarily due to the R&D tax credit that was not in effect during Q2 2010 but was in effect during Q2 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 5% from $1.24 to $1.18.
Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw a robust EPS growth in our business in Q2, excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at foreign exchange and its effect on our Q2 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 5%. This quarter, foreign exchange contributed the remaining 4%, while price had virtually no impact on worldwide revenue growth.
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 counter cyclical growth drivers: Japan, Animal Health and emerging market. Volume growth in Japan was 15%, driven by the recent launches of Cymbalta and Forteo. Recall that the Q1 precautionary buying as a result of the Japanese earthquake and its aftermath increased Q1 sales by about $30 million to $35 million. As expected, this was largely worse in Q2, trimming Japan's volume growth this quarter by about 6 percentage points.
Unlike the Animal Health, volume growth was 16% in Q2, driven by the increase in demand for food animal products globally as well as the launch of Trifexis in the U.S., the continued expansion of our PA [ph] animal business globally and the acquisition of certain European animal health assets from Pfizer.
Finally, embedded within the Rest of World line is our emerging markets revenue growth of 11% in volume and 13% overall. Particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 20% volume and 26% overall. This quarter, it is worth reviewing the effect of foreign exchange on the rest of our income statement. While FX did not have a large effect on EPS growth, it did affect individual line item.
Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange currencies. The numbers in the first column are the same as those used on the last column on Slide 6. Let's focus on the second column of the numbers which groups out the effect of foreign exchange rate. 
First, you'll see the 5% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin also grew 5%. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was entirely due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expenses grew 9%, excluding FX. This increase was driven by the BI deal, the launch of new products and indications and the pharmaceutical industry fee. 
Since the increase in operating expense exceeded the increase in gross margin, operating income declined 3% and EPS declined 4%. You can see that while FX had a material impact on revenue, cost of sales and operating expense, it really almost had no impact on operating income for the EPS this quarter. So while FX didn't have much of an impact on EPS growth, U.S. health care reform, the effect of due of our patent expirations outside of Japan and the investments related to the BI, Eli [ph] certainly did. As mentioned earlier, excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of these same items on our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of July 11 inclusive of the changes since our April update. Our clinical phase portfolio now stands at 70 to state [ph], including 33 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotech molecules represent over 40% of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as our overall clinical portfolio.
Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows, you can see that since our April update, we received FDA approval for and launched Tradjenta; we've had two assets in the Phase II testing; we advanced an additional 3 assets in the Phase I testing, including our basal insulin RGs [ph]. We expect to begin pivotal trials for this molecule before year end, and we terminated development of one Phase I asset.
As Doctor Lundberg shared during our investment community meeting on June 30, we're very pleased with the progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality pipeline with many potential opportunities to advance patient care and nasal [ph] diseases, with large, unmet needs as well as commercial opportunity. We're on track to meet or exceed our goal of having 10 entities in Phase III by year end and believe that our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014.

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key events for the remainder of the year. 
As mentioned earlier, having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of linagliptin, we look forward to the European Commission approval later this quarter and then launching the product in Europe later this year. In addition to our successes so far this year, we have a number of other potential regulatory approvals in the U.S. this year, including Cialis for BPH, by aide in combination with basal insulin; and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer. Expect the regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for BYDUREON, the sBLA for Erbitux and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Amyvid. We continue to expect a maturing of our mid to late stage pipeline as Phase III trials could begin this year for, one, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product, as well as our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody.
Finally, on the legal front, at anytime, we could have rulings from the CAFC on the Strattera patent challenge and from the District Court in Delaware on the Alimta patent challenge. Now you may recall that in the Alimta case, the judge had indicated from the bench that a ruling would be issued in Lily's favor. 
Now in terms of our 2011 financial guidance, we've updated the guidance issued in April for a number of factors, including continued strong volume growth in revenue, driven by our 3 counter-cyclical growth engines and our patent-protected brand; secondly, stronger foreign currencies, which drives up the expected growth rates of revenue, SG&A and R&D; thirdly, very prompt approval to linagliptin in multiple market, which is driving an increase in expected SG&A spend in 2011, as well as some additional expected revenue; and fourthly, the write-down of the intangible value of liprotamase, which is driving higher expected net other expense for the year.
In total, these changes result in an increase in narrowing of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.25 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.85 to $3.95 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge from the BI alliance and $0.17 in restructuring charges for the first half of the year.
Now these changes have resulted in updates to the most of the individual line items as well. Revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digits, while we expect the gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. SG&A growth is now expected to be in the high single digits, and R&D growth is now expected to be in the low single digits.
Other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $100 million to $175 million. We still expect our 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance.
In summary, 2011 continues to play out as we had anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial result. We remain on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year. 
And as John articulated on June 30, we're seeing promising signs that, in addition to increasing in numbers, our mid- to late-stage pipeline is increasing in quality as well. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation to return to growth post-Years YZ.
We also remain on track to meet our 2011 headcount as expense containment goals, helping to create the financial flexibility to invest in our pipeline, our counter-cyclical growth engines in current brands, as well as maintain the dividend. In Q2, we saw this impact of the headwinds that we anticipated when we issued our 2011 financial guidance in January, and when we updated that guidance on our Q1 earnings call in April. These headwinds are patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan; U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost this year than it did in 2010; and near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. While we did see the negative impact in Q2 of these items, we again delivered strong growth in the remainder of our business. Excluding those 3 items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 13%, operating expense growth of 7% and high-teens EPS growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering a solid financial result, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline and outspeeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post-Years YZ. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

In Japan, Marc, it really is still pretty widespread and good growth. Forteo, for example, is off to a very strong start with the launch on the second half of last year. Cymbalta is doing very well. The insulins are doing extremely well. Alimta share growth has been extremely good since the launch there.

So when you look at our SG&A spend guidance for the year, the primary driver of the increase is FX related, similar to what we talked about on the top line. But at the same time, we are supporting the earlier launches of Tradjenta in those key markets that I highlighted. So those are the 2 factors. And in terms of characterization we've been getting in the past, we talked about their being dilution obviously higher this year driven by the upfront charge that we had in the first quarter and then lessening between 2012 and '13, and then turning positive '14 and beyond. We obviously would have like it little more dilution this year given the incremental investment codes [ph] on some of these approval and launches coming towards the earlier end of the spectrum of what was contemplated.

As you all know, Effient is a irreversible, once-daily antiplatelet, while Brilinta is a reversible, twice-daily agent. A key difference is that, in the Effient studies, which of course are not the same as the Brilinta studies. And to really compare them, we need direct head-to-head studies. But the U.S. patients in the Effient studies did better than Plavix, but for some, still unclear reason in Brilinta. The U.S. patients actually did better on Plavix than on Brilinta, with which, it's a discrepancy for Brilinta to the whole world data. There is also some dyspnea some side effects with Brilinta that Effient doesn't have. So for the moment, I think we have here 2 effective antiplatelet agents in the more whole world populations, while in the U.S. population, Effient did better. And the FDA, I think, took that interpretation into actually saying that Brilinta should not be used when you have a high aspirin dose, which clearly Effient can be used when you have. And since, I think, the U.S. treatment paradigm today has a high number of high aspirin in combinations, it's actually would favor Effient. But overall, we need the head-to-head studies to really make a direct comparison. In relation to solanezumab and the futility analysis that will come up later this year, this is a judgment then of the DMC, of the benefit-risk component. They will look clearly at safety as well as futility of efficacy, and this is their judgment. But my interpretation is that, since Alzheimer's disease is a very serious disease, there is no real treatment to stop progression of disease. And we don't really know today when would the potential effect start of preventing than amyloid. So my feeling is, this will be a judgment call for the DMC.

What we will be doing each and every time that we do have a patent expiration whether it be a injectable like we have with Gemzar, or oral small molecule like Zyprexa or Cymbalta. We'll definitely look at a host of different options, and I think it's safe to assume that we have, in both occasions, already done planning, looking at different things to see what is the most appropriate late life cycle strategy for the molecule. I would say that is not the case, where an AG would always be a preferred approach. So really, it will be molecule-by-molecule basis. If we were to elect not to do one, on the next one up, for example, I wouldn't take that as indication that we didn't like the way that AG went with Gemzar. In fact, we've felt that has gone quite well. And if we would be one, for example, on Zyprexa, I don't know if that would mean necessarily we would do well on Cymbalta. It really does come down to what the lines of business the customer groups that these products go to, capabilities or partners, et cetera. We'll keep you posted, but at that this time, we have no comment specifically on what would be planned, what would be likely for the Zyprexa."

Where there will be agreement to go ahead and cap the government's expenditures on pharmaceuticals as a percent I believe of the overall health care spend, with the industry providing some rebates if spend exceeds those levels. Clearly, with continued budget pressures in a number of countries, we'll continue to monitor the situation. We do think that there are already some pretty substantial cuts taken, particularly on the pharmaceutical side of some of the health care and broader entitlement spending in European nations.

So much of the action that you saw in 2010 even was really directed against reducing prices of generics and setting up situations, where once a branded product goes generic, so the initial price was for generics will come out lower. You probably put this in detail, that in many products, you've seen in the past that branded price will be a little lower in Europe than here in the U.S. But actually, the generic price will be substantially higher in Europe than here in the U.S. So again, I think you're going to see a stronger push to use generics more quickly and more fully, and so the markets in the past may have been slow-erosion markets."

Since we just provided a comprehensive overview of our business at our investment community meeting on June 30, today, we'll limit our prepared remarks, leaving more time for the Q&A session. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision.
Since the Q1 earnings call in April, we've had a number of significant event, many of them in our diabetes business. On the regulatory front, we had important news for Bydureon. The European Commission granted final approval of BYDUREON, the long-acting formulation of exenatide and the first once-weekly treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. We launched in the U.K. last week, with launches in other European countries expected over the course of 2011 in the first half of 2012. 
We submitted BYDUREON to regulatory authorities in Japan and, along with Amylin, we completed the thorough QT study to support the U.S. NDA for BYDUREON. In the study, when administered at and above therapeutic levels, exenatide did not prolong the corrected QT interval in healthy individuals. Further, the study found no relationship between QTc interval and plasma exenatide concentrations. We intend to submit our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter in Q3.
We also had quite a bit of regulatory news on the linagliptin, the FDA approval of linagliptin, under the trade name Tradjenta, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the product here in the U.S. in May, presented as the first DPP4 inhibitor to be approved at one dosage strength, with no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with kidney or liver impairment.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (sic) [Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare] approved linagliptin under the trade name Trazenta. Along with the eye [ph], we expect to launch the product in Japan later this quarter. Continuing the string of rapid approvals, regulatory authorities in Mexico and Brazil also approved linagliptin, known there as Trayenta, and launches in these countries are also expected in Q3. In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of Trajenta, and we expect final EC approval later this quarter. Clearly, we're very pleased with the significant progress achieved during Q2 in our diabetes business.
In non-diabetes regulatory news, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we submitted the sBLA for Erbitux in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer. On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented positive data from PARAMOUNT, the second study to evaluate the use of Alimta's maintenance therapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and the first study to evaluate the use of continuation maintenance with Alimta, following first-line Alimta plus cisplatin therapy. Based on data from PARAMOUNT, we submitted our dossier [ph] in Europe earlier this year. And we plan to submit here in the U.S. once we have more mature, overall survival data.
On the business development front, we received final EC approval for and finally closed on our acquisition of Janssen's animal health business. We signed an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with Synthes, under which the 2 companies will jointly develop site-specific bone-healing products. The companies will also conduct and fund the evaluation of additional orthopedic uses for Forteo. In addition to the development component of the agreement, the collaboration includes the co-promotion of Forteo to orthopedic surgeons in the U.S. and in select o U.S. countries.
We signed agreements with private investors to establish BioCritica. Based in Indianapolis, BioCritica will initially focus on the continued U.S. development and commercialization of Xigris for severe sepsis. BioCritica will acquire the U.S. development and commercialization rights to Xigris and will also receive the rights to potentially acquire several critical care compounds currently in pre-clinical development of Lilly. The collaboration agreement also includes an option for BioCritica to acquire the development and commercialization rights to Xigris outside the U.S. at a later date.
We entered into a collaboration with Medtronic to research and development new approach to treating Parkinson's disease that involves delivering a potential new medicine to the brain using an implantable drug delivery system. Specifically, the goal of the collaboration is to develop a therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease that combines the strengths of Lily's biologic, a modified form of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor with Medtronic's implantable drug infusion system technology. 
Lastly on the legal front, the Supreme Court denied Lilly's petition to reconsider a federal appeals court ruling invalidating the Gemzar method of used patent. And the judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ordered all generic drug manufacturers, challenging the validity of the crack compound patent for Cymbalta not to sell a generic version of duloxetine until the patent expires. As a result, we do not expect generic duloxetine come into market until the Cymbalta patent expires in June 2013 or December 2013, if we're successful in obtaining the six-month pediatric exclusivity.
Now as a background, Ronika will discuss our Q2 financial results and provide our pipeline update, and Derica will then cover key events to our major 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"

This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments an",1197,"Thanks, Phil. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comment on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q2 income statement. 
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth of 9% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effective view of health care reform, revenue would've grown 13%. Compared to Q2 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points but we're still strong at 80.4%. This decrease is entirely due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. 
Operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 12% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 16%, over an increase in R&D with 6%. Drivers of the increase in operating expense include expenses related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, higher sales and marketing expenses to support launches of new products and new indications, as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. health care reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would've grown 7%.
Other income and deductions was in net expense of $58 million this quarter, which was higher than it was last year. The higher net expense was due to a write-down in the value of the liprotamase asset as a result of the FDA Complete Response Letter we received in April, in which the agency requested additional clinical data. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter or 1.6 percentage points lower than in Q2 2010. This reduction is primarily due to the R&D tax credit that was not in effect during Q2 2010 but was in effect during Q2 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 5% from $1.24 to $1.18.
Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw a robust EPS growth in our business in Q2, excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at foreign exchange and its effect on our Q2 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 5%. This quarter, foreign exchange contributed the remaining 4%, while price had virtually no impact on worldwide revenue growth.
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 counter cyclical growth drivers: Japan, Animal Health and emerging market. Volume growth in Japan was 15%, driven by the recent launches of Cymbalta and Forteo. Recall that the Q1 precautionary buying as a result of the Japanese earthquake and its aftermath increased Q1 sales by about $30 million to $35 million. As expected, this was largely worse in Q2, trimming Japan's volume growth this quarter by about 6 percentage points.
Unlike the Animal Health, volume growth was 16% in Q2, driven by the increase in demand for food animal products globally as well as the launch of Trifexis in the U.S., the continued expansion of our PA [ph] animal business globally and the acquisition of certain European animal health assets from Pfizer.
Finally, embedded within the Rest of World line is our emerging markets revenue growth of 11% in volume and 13% overall. Particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 20% volume and 26% overall. This quarter, it is worth reviewing the effect of foreign exchange on the rest of our income statement. While FX did not have a large effect on EPS growth, it did affect individual line item.
Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange currencies. The numbers in the first column are the same as those used on the last column on Slide 6. Let's focus on the second column of the numbers which groups out the effect of foreign exchange rate. 
First, you'll see the 5% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin also grew 5%. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was entirely due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expenses grew 9%, excluding FX. This increase was driven by the BI deal, the launch of new products and indications and the pharmaceutical industry fee. 
Since the increase in operating expense exceeded the increase in gross margin, operating income declined 3% and EPS declined 4%. You can see that while FX had a material impact on revenue, cost of sales and operating expense, it really almost had no impact on operating income for the EPS this quarter. So while FX didn't have much of an impact on EPS growth, U.S. health care reform, the effect of due of our patent expirations outside of Japan and the investments related to the BI alliance certainly did. As mentioned earlier, excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of these same items on our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of July 11 inclusive of the changes since our April update. Our clinical phase portfolio now stands at 70 to state [ph], including 33 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotech molecules represent over 40% of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as our overall clinical portfolio.
Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows, you can see that since our April update, we received FDA approval for and launched Tradjenta; we've had two assets in the Phase II testing; we advanced an additional 3 assets in the Phase I testing, including our basal insulin RGs [ph]. We expect to begin pivotal trials for this molecule before year end, and we terminated development of one Phase I asset.
As Doctor Lundberg shared during our investment community meeting on June 30, we're very pleased with the progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality pipeline with many potential opportunities to advance patient care and nasal [ph] diseases, with large, unmet needs as well as commercial opportunity. We're on track to meet or exceed our goal of having 10 entities in Phase III by year end and believe that our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"
285467,97242192,144723,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Ronika.

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key events for the remainder of the year. 
As mentioned earlier, having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of linagliptin, we look forward to the European Commission approval later this quarter and then launching the product in Europe later this year. In addition to our successes so far this year, we have a number of other potential regulatory approvals in the U.S. this year, including Cialis for BPH, by aide in combination with basal insulin; and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer. Expect the regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for BYDUREON, the sBLA for Erbitux and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Amyvid. We continue to expect a maturing of our mid to late stage pipeline as Phase III trials could begin this year for, one, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product, as well as our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody.
Finally, on the legal front, at anytime, we could have rulings from the CAFC on the Strattera patent challenge and from the District Court in Delaware on the Alimta patent challenge. Now you may recall that in the Alimta case, the judge had indicated from the bench that a ruling would be issued in Lily's favor. 
Now in terms of our 2011 financial guidance, we've updated the guidance issued in April for a number of factors, including continued strong volume growth in revenue, driven by our 3 counter-cyclical growth engines and our patent-protected brand; secondly, stronger foreign currencies, which drives up the expected growth rates of revenue, SG&A and R&D; thirdly, very prompt approval to linagliptin in multiple markets, which is driving an increase in expected SG&A spend in 2011, as well as some additional expected revenue; and fourthly, the write-down of the intangible value of liprotamase, which is driving higher expected net other expense for the year.
In total, these changes result in an increase in narrowing of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.25 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.85 to $3.95 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge from the BI alliance and $0.17 in restructuring charges for the first half of the year.
Now these changes have resulted in updates to the most of the individual line items as well. Revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digits, while we expect the gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. SG&A growth is now expected to be in the high single digits, and R&D growth is now expected to be in the low single digits.
Other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $100 million to $175 million. We still expect our 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance.
In summary, 2011 continues to play out as we had anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial result. We remain on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year. 
And as John articulated on June 30, we're seeing promising signs that, in addition to increasing in numbers, our mid- to late-stage pipeline is increasing in quality as well. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation to return to growth post-Years YZ.
We also remain on track to meet our 2011 headcount as expense containment goals, helping to create the financial flexibility to invest in our pipeline, our counter-cyclical growth engines in current brands, as well as maintain the dividend. In Q2, we saw this impact of the headwinds that we anticipated when we issued our 2011 financial guidance in January, and when we updated that guidance on our Q1 earnings call in April. These headwinds are patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan; U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost this year than it did in 2010; and near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. While we did see the negative impact in Q2 of these items, we again delivered strong growth in the remainder of our business. Excluding those 3 items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 13%, operating expense growth of 7% and high-teens EPS growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering a solid financial result, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline and outspeeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post-Years YZ. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

In Japan, Marc, it really is still pretty widespread and good growth. Forteo, for example, is off to a very strong start with the launch on the second half of last year. Cymbalta is doing very well. The insulins are doing extremely well. Alimta share growth has been extremely good since the launch there. Going back, I think, that would have been earlier in 2010, again, late 2009, so really broad-based growth across a number of products driving the Japanese performance."

I'm assuming that, that is what brought that down to 0% given numerous list price increases for U.S. products. Second, how do you see Effient competing with Rowenta [ph]? And could you characterize how we should think about the competition playing out in the U.S. differently from x U.S. market? And then third, how much of a positive read should investors take away from a futility analysis later this year that results in solanezumab continuing to completion, meaning, could you give us a sense for how low or high the efficacy bar is in the futility assessment?"

As you all know, Effient is a irreversible, once-daily antiplatelet, while Brilinta is a reversible, twice-daily agent. A key difference is that, in the Effient studies, which of course are not the same as the Brilinta studies. And to really compare them, we need direct head-to-head studies. But the U.S. patients in the Effient studies did better than Plavix, but for some, still unclear reason in Brilinta. The U.S. patients actually did better on Plavix than on Brilinta, with which, it's a discrepancy for Brilinta to the whole world data. There is also some dyspnea some side effects with Brilinta that Effient doesn't have. So for the moment, I think we have here 2 effective antiplatelet agents in the more whole world populations, while in the U.S. population, Effient did better. And the FDA, I think, took that interpretation into actually saying that Brilinta should not be used when you have a high aspirin dose, which clearly Effient can be used when you have. And since, I think, the U.S. treatment paradigm today has a high number of high aspirin in combinations, it is actually would favor Effient. But overall, we need the head-to-head studies to really make a direct comparison. In relation to solanezumab and the futility analysis that will come up later this year, this is a judgment then of the DMC, of the benefit-risk component. They will look clearly at safety as well as futility of efficacy, and this is their judgment. But my interpretation is that, since Alzheimer's disease is a very serious disease, there is no real treatment to stop progression of disease. And we don't really know today when would the potential effect start of preventing than amyloid. So my feeling is, this will be a judgment call for the DMC. And whatever the outcome, we need to wait for the full study before we can draw any clear conclusions."

In relation to the reported increase in cancer then for the BMS-AstraZeneca compound, we have no evidence so far that this is happening with the empagliflozin. Clearly, we only have more short-term observations, and we really need to have all the Phase III data before giving any definite answers. We observed also single case of the high slow. We have not seen that in our studies. Just a final comment to come back to the cancer, the reports here, that there is no clinical data or mechanistic hypothesis that would support that there is an increased risk of, for instance, bladder cancer.

Since we just provided a comprehensive overview of our business at our investment community meeting on June 30, today, we'll limit our prepared remarks, leaving more time for the Q&A session. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision.
Since the Q1 earnings call in April, we've had a number of significant event, many of them in our diabetes business. On the regulatory front, we had important news for Bydureon. The European Commission granted final approval of BYDUREON, the long-acting formulation of exenatide and the first once-weekly treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. We launched in the U.K. last week, with launches in other European countries expected over the course of 2011 in the first half of 2012. 
We submitted BYDUREON to regulatory authorities in Japan and, along with Amylin, we completed the thorough QT study to support the U.S. NDA for BYDUREON. In the study, when administered at and above therapeutic levels, exenatide did not prolong the corrected QT interval in healthy individuals. Further, the study found no relationship between QTc interval and plasma exenatide concentrations. We intend to submit our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter in Q3.
We also had quite a bit of regulatory news on the linagliptin, the FDA approval of linagliptin, under the trade name Tradjenta, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the product here in the U.S. in May, presented as the first DPP4 inhibitor to be approved at one dosage strength, with no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with kidney or liver impairment.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (sic) [Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare] approved linagliptin under the trade name Trazenta. Along with the eye [ph], we expect to launch the product in Japan later this quarter. Continuing the string of rapid approvals, regulatory authorities in Mexico and Brazil also approved linagliptin, known there as Trayenta, and launches in these countries are also expected in Q3. In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of Trajenta, and we expect final EC approval later this quarter. Clearly, we're very pleased with the significant progress achieved during Q2 in our diabetes business.
In non-diabetes regulatory news, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we submitted the sBLA for Erbitux in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer. On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented positive data from PARAMOUNT, the second study to evaluate the use of Alimta's maintenance therapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and the first study to evaluate the use of continuation maintenance with Alimta, following first-line Alimta plus cisplatin therapy. Based on data from PARAMOUNT, we submitted our dossier [ph] in Europe earlier this year. And we plan to submit here in the U.S. once we have more mature, overall survival data.
On the business development front, we received final EC approval for and finally closed on our acquisition of Janssen's animal health business. We signed an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with Synthes, under which the 2 companies will jointly develop site-specific bone-healing products. The companies will also conduct and fund the evaluation of additional orthopedic uses for Forteo. In addition to the development component of the agreement, the collaboration includes the co-promotion of Forteo to orthopedic surgeons in the U.S. and in select o U.S. countries.
We signed agreements with private investors to establish BioCritica. Based in Indianapolis, BioCritica will initially focus on the continued U.S. development and commercialization of Xigris for severe sepsis. BioCritica will acquire the U.S. development and commercialization rights to Xigris and will also receive the rights to potentially acquire several critical care compounds currently in pre-clinical development of Lilly. The collaboration agreement also includes an option for BioCritica to acquire the development and commercialization rights to Xigris outside the U.S. at a later date.
We entered into a collaboration with Medtronic to research and development new approach to treating Parkinson's disease that involves delivering a potential new medicine to the brain using an implantable drug delivery system. Specifically, the goal of the collaboration is to develop a therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease that combines the strengths of Lily's biologic, a modified form of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor with Medtronic's implantable drug infusion system technology. 
Lastly on the legal front, the Supreme Court denied Lilly's petition to reconsider a federal appeals court ruling invalidating the Gemzar method of used patent. And the judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ordered all generic drug manufacturers, challenging the validity of the crack compound patent for Cymbalta not to sell a generic version of duloxetine until the patent expires. As a result, we do not expect generic duloxetine come into market until the Cymbalta patent expires in June 2013 or December 2013, if we're successful in obtaining the six-month pediatric exclusivity.
Now as a background, Ronika will discuss our Q2 financial results and provide our pipeline update, and Derica will then cover key events to our major 2011 and our financial guidance for the year. Ronika?"
285467,97242192,145178,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comment on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business.

As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comment on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into our underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q2 income statement. 
On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth of 9% this quarter. Excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effective view of health care reform, revenue would've grown 13%. Compared to Q2 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points but we're still strong at 80.4%. This decrease is entirely due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. 
Operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 12% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 16%, over an increase in R&D with 6%. Drivers of the increase in operating expense include expenses related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, higher sales and marketing expenses to support launches of new products and new indications, as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. health care reform and the BI alliance, operating expenses would've grown 7%.
Other income and deductions was in net expense of $58 million this quarter, which was higher than it was last year. The higher net expense was due to a write-down in the value of the liprotamase asset as a result of the FDA Complete Response Letter we received in April, in which the agency requested additional clinical data. 
Our tax rate was 20.9% this quarter or 1.6 percentage points lower than in Q2 2010. This reduction is primarily due to the R&D tax credit that was not in effect during Q2 2010 but was in effect during Q2 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 5% from $1.24 to $1.18.
Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw a robust EPS growth in our business in Q2, excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance. Excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at foreign exchange and its effect on our Q2 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 5%. This quarter, foreign exchange contributed the remaining 4%, while price had virtually no impact on worldwide revenue growth.
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 counter cyclical growth drivers: Japan, Animal Health and emerging market. Volume growth in Japan was 15%, driven by the recent launches of Cymbalta and Forteo. Recall that the Q1 precautionary buying as a result of the Japanese earthquake and its aftermath increased Q1 sales by about $30 million to $35 million. As expected, this was largely worse in Q2, trimming Japan's volume growth this quarter by about 6 percentage points.
Unlike the Animal Health, volume growth was 16% in Q2, driven by the increase in demand for food animal products globally as well as the launch of Trifexis in the U.S., the continued expansion of our PA [ph] animal business globally and the acquisition of certain European animal health assets from Pfizer.
Finally, embedded within the Rest of World line is our emerging markets revenue growth of 11% in volume and 13% overall. Particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 20% volume and 26% overall. This quarter, it is worth reviewing the effect of foreign exchange on the rest of our income statement. While FX did not have a large effect on EPS growth, it did affect individual line item.
Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange currencies. The numbers in the first column are the same as those used on the last column on Slide 6. Let's focus on the second column of the numbers which groups out the effect of foreign exchange rate. 
First, you'll see the 5% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin also grew 5%. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was entirely due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expenses grew 9%, excluding FX. This increase was driven by the BI deal, the launch of new products and indications and the pharmaceutical industry fee. 
Since the increase in operating expense exceeded the increase in gross margin, operating income declined 3% and EPS declined 4%. You can see that while FX had a material impact on revenue, cost of sales and operating expense, it really almost had no impact on operating income for the EPS this quarter. So while FX didn't have much of an impact on EPS growth, U.S. health care reform, the effect of due of our patent expirations outside of Japan and the investments related to the BI alliance certainly did. As mentioned earlier, excluding these items, EPS would've grown in the high teens.
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of these same items on our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our portfolio of new molecular entities in clinical development as of July 11 inclusive of the changes since our April update. Our clinical phase portfolio now stands at 70 to state [ph], including 33 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Biotech molecules represent over 40% of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as our overall clinical portfolio.
Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows, you can see that since our April update, we received FDA approval for and launched Tradjenta; we've had two assets in the Phase II testing; we advanced an additional 3 assets in the Phase I testing, including our basal insulin RGs [ph]. We expect to begin pivotal trials for this molecule before year end, and we terminated development of one Phase I asset.
As Doctor Lundberg shared during our investment community meeting on June 30, we're very pleased with the progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality pipeline with many potential opportunities to advance patient care and nasal [ph] diseases, with large, unmet needs as well as commercial opportunity. We're on track to meet or exceed our goal of having 10 entities in Phase III by year end and believe that our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"
285467,97242192,145178,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Ronika.

To set the stage for our financial guidance, let me briefly cover some of the key events for the remainder of the year. 
As mentioned earlier, having now received the CHMP recommendation for approval of linagliptin, we look forward to the European Commission approval later this quarter and then launching the product in Europe later this year. In addition to our successes so far this year, we have a number of other potential regulatory approvals in the U.S. this year, including Cialis for BPH, by aide in combination with basal insulin; and Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer. Expect the regulatory submissions include our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for BYDUREON, the sBLA for Erbitux and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and our response to the FDA Complete Response Letter for Amyvid. We continue to expect a maturing of our mid to late stage pipeline as Phase III trials could begin this year for, one, our novel basal insulin analog and our new insulin glargine product, as well as our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody.
Finally, on the legal front, at anytime, we could have rulings from the CAFC on the Strattera patent challenge and from the District Court in Delaware on the Alimta patent challenge. Now you may recall that in the Alimta case, the judge had indicated from the bench that a ruling would be issued in Lily's favor. 
Now in terms of our 2011 financial guidance, we've updated the guidance issued in April for a number of factors, including continued strong volume growth in revenue, driven by our 3 counter-cyclical growth engines and our patent-protected brand; secondly, stronger foreign currencies, which drives up the expected growth rates of revenue, SG&A and R&D; thirdly, very prompt approval to linagliptin in multiple markets, which is driving an increase in expected SG&A spend in 2011, as well as some additional expected revenue; and fourthly, the write-down of the intangible value of liprotamase, which is driving higher expected net other expense for the year.
In total, these changes result in an increase in narrowing of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of between $4.25 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.85 to $3.95 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge from the BI alliance and $0.17 in restructuring charges for the first half of the year.
Now these changes have resulted in updates to the most of the individual line items as well. Revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digits, while we expect the gross margin as a percent of revenue to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. SG&A growth is now expected to be in the high single digits, and R&D growth is now expected to be in the low single digits.
Other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $100 million to $175 million. We still expect our 2011 effective tax rate will be approximately 21% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20% on a reported basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance.
In summary, 2011 continues to play out as we had anticipated. We're making progress advancing our pipeline, and we're delivering solid financial result. We remain on track to meet our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of this year. 
And as John articulated on June 30, we're seeing promising signs that, in addition to increasing in numbers, our mid- to late-stage pipeline is increasing in quality as well. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation to return to growth post-Years YZ.
We also remain on track to meet our 2011 headcount as expense containment goals, helping to create the financial flexibility to invest in our pipeline, our counter-cyclical growth engines in current brands, as well as maintain the dividend. In Q2, we saw this impact of the headwinds that we anticipated when we issued our 2011 financial guidance in January, and when we updated that guidance on our Q1 earnings call in April. These headwinds are patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan; U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost this year than it did in 2010; and near-term dilution from our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. While we did see the negative impact in Q2 of these items, we again delivered strong growth in the remainder of our business. Excluding those 3 items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 13%, operating expense growth of 7% and high-teens EPS growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering a solid financial result, improving productivity to allow for appropriate investment in our patent-protected products and our pipeline and outspeeding the next generation of Lilly molecules to market to provide growth post-Years YZ. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

In Japan, Marc, it really is still pretty widespread and good growth. Forteo, for example, is off to a very strong start with the launch on the second half of last year. Cymbalta is doing very well. The insulins are doing extremely well. Alimta share growth has been extremely good since the launch there.

But we're very happy as well with our -- the current state of our Elanco animal health business. And right now, we're the fastest growing entity in that space, and we feel very good about the launches that Jeff talked about in New York, where we've had 6 launches so far this year coming from our own pipeline. So with or without an additional transaction, we believe we have the capacity to sustain the type of growth that you've seen through this point. And in fact, in the second quarter this year and in the second quarter here, Elanco grew actually 20%. In regards to the impact of the Janssen deal that we just closed this year, it's basically neutral to the bottom line."

But at the same time, we are supporting the earlier launches of Tradjenta in those key markets that I highlighted. So those are the 2 factors. And in terms of characterization we've been getting in the past, we talked about their being dilution obviously higher this year driven by the upfront charge that we had in the first quarter and then lessening between 2012 and '13, and then turning positive '14 and beyond. We obviously would have like it little more dilution this year given the incremental investment codes [ph] on some of these approval and launches coming towards the earlier end of the spectrum of what was contemplated.

As you all know, Effient is a irreversible, once-daily antiplatelet, while Brilinta is a reversible, twice-daily agent. A key difference is that, in the Effient studies, which of course are not the same as the Brilinta studies. And to really compare them, we need direct head-to-head studies. But the U.S. patients in the Effient studies did better than Plavix, but for some, still unclear reason in Brilinta. The U.S. patients actually did better on Plavix than on Brilinta, with which, it's a discrepancy for Brilinta to the whole world data. There is also some dyspnea some side effects with Brilinta that Effient doesn't have. So for the moment, I think we have here 2 effective antiplatelet agents in the more whole world populations, while in the U.S. population, Effient did better. And the FDA, I think, took that interpretation into actually saying that Brilinta should not be used when you have a high aspirin dose, which clearly Effient can be used when you have. And since, I think, the U.S. treatment paradigm today has a high number of high aspirin in combinations, it is actually would favor Effient. But overall, we need the head-to-head studies to really make a direct comparison. In relation to solanezumab and the futility analysis that will come up later this year, this is a judgment then of the DMC, of the benefit-risk component. They will look clearly at safety as well as futility of efficacy, and this is their judgment. But my interpretation is that, since Alzheimer's disease is a very serious disease, there is no real treatment to stop progression of disease. And we don't really know today when would the potential effect start of preventing than amyloid. So my feeling is, this will be a judgment call for the DMC. And whatever the outcome, we need to wait for the full study before we can draw any clear conclusions."

We do not anticipate there's going to have a material impact on Lilly. I think the bigger impact may actually be on the health plans themselves that they service in terms of going from reducing the number of players. For us, we obviously feel very good about the attributes of our brand. And then maybe at the therapeutic area, where we compete today, there is already low-cost generic options available, yet our brands have held up very well. So in cases like depression or even in schizophrenia, with reason all being generic. So we're not anticipating that this is going to have a material impact on Lilly at this stage but once again, still early. In regard to the Q3 or Q4 impact of SG&A and R&D, I think it's pretty much embedded in our guidance and the color I've provided earlier. If you're looking at SG&A, primarily what you're seeing in terms of our change in our line item guidance is the impact of exchange rate, both in SG&A and R&D.

And then the fact that we've positioned themselves to benefit as they should from those patent expirations. So much of the action that you saw in 2010 even was really directed against reducing prices of generic and setting up situations, where once a branded product goes generic, so the initial price was for generics will come out lower. You probably put this in detail, that in many products, you've seen in the past that branded price will be a little lower in Europe than here in the U.S. But actually, the generic price will be substantially higher in Europe than here in the U.S. So again, I think you're going to see a stronger push to use generics more quickly and more fully, in some of the markets in the past may have been slow-erosion markets."

During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision.
Let's begin with a recap of events since our Q2 earnings call. With multiple developments on the regulatory front, the European Commission granted final approval for Trajenta for adults with Type 2 diabetes. EU launches have begun starting with the U.K. Launches in other European countries are expected over the balance of 2011 and the first half of 2012. Despite initial impact we help to reach an agreement with local authorities that Trajenta be made available to German patients. 
The FDA approved Cialis for once daily use for the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. And men who have both erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat both ED and BPH. Just last night, the FDA approved Byetta for use with insulin glargine. Europe CHMP issued a positive opinion for use of Alimta as a continuation maintenance therapy in patients with non-squamous non small cell lung cancer after initial treatment with Alimta plus cisplatin. 
We expect EC approval during Q4. Along with Amlin and, we submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Bydureon, and the FDA assigned a PDUFA date of January 28, 2012. We also submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Amyvid, a imaging under investigation for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brains of living patients. And finally, we submitted the sBLA for Erbitux in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. On the business development front, we entered into 2 different agreements to bolster our diabetes presence in EMEA. First, we entered into collaboration with Lupin Limited under which Lupin will promote Humulin in India and Nepal. And we expanded our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to include copromotion Linagliptin by Lilly and copromotion of Humalog by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Also in earlier stage in this development initiative we launched a new platform called Open Innovation Drug Discovery to both build our own pipeline and identify molecules that may be useful in the treatment of multiple drug resistance tuberculosis. On the legal front, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Lilly's favor in the Strattera patent case, overturning a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court of New Jersey and upholding the Strattera method of use patent, which will expire in May 2017. 
The defendants filed a motion for rehearing, and earlier this week, the court denied their request. Lastly, an important news for our industry and for Lilly, the America Invents Act was signed into law. Not only will this new law align U.S. patent laws more closely to those of other countries but we believe it will improve U.S. competitiveness by reducing the backlog of patent applications, enhancing the quality of issued patents and providing greater certainty for those that invest in innovation. Now as background, Ronika will discuss our Q3 financial results and provide our pipeline update. And then Derica will cover our financial guidance for 2011 and key events for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. Ronika?"

As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. We'll also provide commentary on our Q3 results, excluding the effect of headwinds that were highlighted in previous discussions of both our quarterly performance and our 2011 guidance. 
I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q3 income statement. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth in this quarter, excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effective U.S. healthcare reform, revenue would have grown 15%. Compared to Q3 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points to 78.2%. This decrease is primarily due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and to a lesser extent, negative mix effect. Operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 13%, while the increase in R&D was 5%. 
Drivers in the increase in operating expenses included cost related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial expense. The effective changes in foreign exchange rates as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturing fee associated with U.S. healthcare reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform and the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance, operating expenses would have grown 3% with this amount entirely driven by foreign exchange. 
Other income and deductions was a net expense of $83.4 million this quarter, which was higher than last year. The higher net expense was due to a partial write-down and the IPR&D value of Amyvid due to revised assumptions for the timing of the potential regulatory approval and sales update. Our tax rate was 17.9% this quarter or 4.6 percentage points lower than Q3 2010. 
The largest items driving this reduction is the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $45.4 million, primarily as a result of a resolution of the company's 2007 IRS tax audit. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 7% from $1.21 to $1.13. Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January we saw a robust EPS growth in our business in Q3. Excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effective patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes alliance. 
Excluding these items, EPS would have grown in the mid-20% range. Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 4%. This quarter, foreign exchange also contributed 4%, while price had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue growth. 
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 countercyclical engines: Japan, animal health and emerging market. In total, these businesses delivered 15% volume growth in the quarter. Volume growth continue to be strong in Japan at 20%, driven by recent launches of both Cymbalta and Forteo. Animal health volume grew 22% in Q3 driven primarily by organic growth, including increased demand for our food animal products and the continued expansion of our companion animal business. 
The launch of Trifexis in the U.S. has been particularly robust. To a lesser extent, this volume growth was driven by the acquisition of certain enhancements and animal health assets in Europe. Finally, embedded within the rest of world line, our emerging markets revenue grew 7% in volume and 5% overall. Although the growth in emerging markets moderated relative to previous quarters, particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 22% in volume and 31% overall. This quarter, FX had a significant effect on EPS. Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of our select line item of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without effects of changes in foreign exchange rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on the last column on Page 6. Let's focus on the second column of numbers, which strip out the effect of foreign exchange. 
First you'll see that the 4% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin of 8% and 3%, respectively. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expenses grew 7%, excluding FX. As mentioned earlier, the increase was driven entirely by the Boehringer Ingelheim deal and the pharmaceutical industry fees. 
Continuing on, you'll see that, excluding FX operating income declined 2% and EPS declined 1%. So you can clearly see that FX had a significant negative effect on EPS this quarter, lowering EPS growth by 6 percentage points to negative 7%. In other words, a favorable effect of FX on our foreign operating income was more than offset by the negative effect of FX on inventories sold, excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance, EPS would have grown in the mid-20s. 
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of the same item of our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our new molecular entities in clinical development as of October 10th, inclusive of changes since our July update. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 66 distinct -- including 35 compounds about in Phase II and Phase III. 
Biotechnology represents half of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as nearly half of our overall clinical portfolio. We continue to make progress in advancing our pipeline. Since July, we began Phase III testing of our new insulin products and we now have 10 distinct compounds in Phase III testing with 2 more likely to begin before year end. 
We advanced 3 assets in the Phase II testing including our myostatin, monoclonal antibody that Lon -- discussed at our June investment committee meeting. We advanced 2 assets in the Phase I testing and we terminated or suspended development of 6 assets across our Phase 1 and Phase II portfolio. In summary, we have already achieved our goal of having 10 NMEs [ph] in Phase III by year end. With Phase III starts expected this quarter for our innovative basal analog influence and for Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody for psoriasis, we could finish this year with 12 NMEs in Phase III testing. 
We're pleased with our progress we've made building a robust, high-quality, mid- to late-stage pipeline with many potential opportunities to advance patient care in diseases with large unmet needs as well as significant commercial opportunity. As outlined at our investment committee meeting in June, we believe our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"

Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how these Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your model. Now clearly this patent exploration, which",1616,"Thanks, Ronika. Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how these Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your model. Now clearly this patent exploration, which is essentially a U.S. and European phenomenon will negatively affect our revenue and income causing our fourth quarter results to differ substantially from those we posted September year-to-date. 
We lost the Zyprexa patent in most European countries last month. This coming Sunday, October 23, we'll lose patent protection for Zyprexa here in the U.S. Now as you might expect during Q3, we saw the initial impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration. Specifically, we saw some reduction in wholesale purchases in anticipation of reduced future sales of branded Zyprexa. 
In addition, we also made accrual to account for the potential future return of products that were sold of the wholesalers during the third quarter. In European markets, we've already seen multiple generic companies enter the various markets, offering very large discounts. For example, in Germany, there are about 20 generic players and the initial generic pricing came in at about a 75% discount to Zyprexa's pre-patent expiry price. 
Now here in the U.S., while we expect rapid and significant erosion of the branded Zyprexa sales, the competitive dynamic will be a bit different as we will have a single generic company marketing each presentation of -- for the first 6 months post patent expiration. Also as part of our late life cycle planning, we've entered into an authorized generic agreement here in the U.S. with -- to allow them to market a generic version of Alanzapin [ph]. Now upon expiration of the 6 month exclusivity period in late April of 2012, we would expect additional companies to market their own generic -- leading to further sales erosion of Zyprexa. 
In summary, on the revenue line, we expect to see a significant negative impact in Q4. This is reflected in the fact that our worldwide revenue has grown 8% September year-to-date, while our full year guidance for 2011 is for revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As you think about the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration on other line items in our income statement, you should keep in mind a few items. We do not expect Zyprexa related manufacturing expenses to decrease at the same rate as sales. While there will be some savings of variable production cost, other fixed costs that had been absorbed by the production of Zyprexa will remain. 
As a result, the expected decline of Zyprexa sales will put downward pressure in our gross margin as a percent of revenue. This is why we forecast gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year 2011 to be between 78% and 79%, despite the fact that it is at 79.5% for the first 9 months of the year. Now in terms of marketing and selling expenses, we currently have very little variable marketing expense behind Zyprexa during this late stage of its lifecycle. 
Consequently, there will be minimal marketing savings post-patent expiration. The major spend behind Zyprexa has been the sales force. Now you should not expect to see a significant reduction in sales force expenses result of the Zyprexa patent expiration for 2 main reasons. First, beginning in late 2009, we restructured our U.S. and then our European neuroscience sales forces, among other factors, this restructuring took into account the CNS sales footprint needed post the Zyprexa patent expiration. Second, keep in mind the Cymbalta sold by these same sales forces and we committed to providing a competitive detailing effort behind this very important brand. 
In a nutshell, our strategy for managing cost leading up to the Zyprexa patent expiration has been to act early and not wait until the event itself was upon us. Since 2004, we've been reducing headcount and driving productivity improvements across all areas of our business. And since 2009, we've upped the pace of rightsizing our organization for the post the Zyprexa period significantly restructuring everything from our senior management layers to our back office operation to our sales and marketing organization. 
As a result of these efforts, we fully expect to meet our goal of reducing our expenses by $1 billion by the end of this year. This will essentially complete our restructuring effort. While we will continue to drive incremental productivity, we have no plans for a major restructuring. Hopefully this is commentary on the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration is helpful as you update your models. 
Now let's review our updated 2011 financial guidance. At a high-level, our updated guidance is very consistent with the guidance we issued on our July earnings call. It reflects continued strong underlying performance over business. It also includes discrete tax benefit and additional charges recorded in Q3. In total, these changes result in an increase in narrowing of our EPS guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, we now expect 2011 EPS of between $4.30 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.89 to $3.94 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge for the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance at $0.18 in restructuring recharges in the first 9 months of the year. 
Our guidance on individual line item is largely unchanged. Revenue still expected to grow in the mid-single digits and gross margin as a percent of revenue it is still expected to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points when compared to the full year of 2010. SG&A growth is still expected to be in high single digits and R&D growth is still expected to be in the low single digits. Our guidance for other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $175 million to $225 million, reflecting the partial impairment of the acquired in-process R&D asset related to Amyvid. 
As a result of the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter, we now expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 19.5% on a reported basis. And we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million. Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010. And the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. In terms of key future events, highlights for the balance of 2011 include potential FDA approval of Erbitux for first-line head and neck cancer. 
The anticipated European Commission approval of Alimta as continuation maintenance therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Expected Phase III starts for our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis. This would bring our Phase III portfolio to 12 new molecular entities, exceeding our goal of 10. We also expect to present key Phase II data on our CETP inhibitor at the American Heart Association meeting in November as well as for our anti-IL-17 and RA at the ACR meeting also in November. 
And in psoriasis at the -- clinic meeting in London in December. Now in the interest of time, I will not recite the full list of potential events for 2012. But as you can see, we have a significant number of -- we have a significant number of potential regulatory actions, phase III trial completions and potential data disclosures. 
We are clearly excited about the year ahead and are pleased with the progress we continue to make in advancing our pipeline. This will remain our number one priority. Now as I mentioned in our July earnings call, 2011 is playing out largely as we had expected. We are delivering solid financial results as we head into the patent expiration and importantly we are making progress in advancing our pipeline. 
As expected, in Q3 we saw the impact of known headwinds, including patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan, U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost in 2011 than it did in 2010 and your dilution from expenses associated with our static diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Now, while these headwinds negatively impacted our Q3 results, we again delivered strong underlying growth in the rest of our business. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 15%, operating expense growth of 3% and mid-20s percent EPS growth. As you think about our future revenue, you will clearly need to factor in the patent expiration of Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe. But I also like to highlight that in Q3, our countercyclical engine what of Japan, emerging markets and animal health collectively grew 19%. And we've got a number of key brands that posted double-digit worldwide revenue growth, including Cymbalta, Humalog, Strattera, Forteo, Cialis and Alimta. 
We've already achieved our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of the year. And we expect to begin Phase III testing of our innovative basal analog insulin and NR anti-IL-17 antibody in psoriasis before year end. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-year YZ. 
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on executing our 3-part strategy as we stated in June. Replenishing and inventing our pipeline, innovation-based biopharmaceutical company this is our future. Second, investing to drive growth in our countercyclical growth engines and currently marketed brands particularly those that do not lose patent protection in the YZ period. And third, continue to drive productivity gains across our business that allow us to fund R&D necessary to fuel our future growth, recapitalize our physical assets and maintain our dividend. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

Before go to the next caller as you're thinking about solanezumab, also in relation to the financial projections that we had discussed in Derica's section of the investment committee meeting in June, we have said all along this is a high risk program. It's very interesting science. We are very hopeful of the potential outcome but we recognize that it's high risk. Essentially, for the financial modeling, what that means is it's a sign of relatively low probability of actually hitting, if you will, so that means for financial projections that low probability goes to 0, it really does not take them down very much. If on the other hand, it were to go ahead and go from that low probability to 1, it would have a substantial potential upside to those numbers. Hope that's helpful."

Now obviously each government is acting in different points in time but we continue to be able to manage our way through that.

Probably the biggest question from a pricing standpoint still remains in the U.S. and emerges from the discussion around the super budget committee and if there's any change as it relates to Healthcare Reform and so for the increases at rebate.

They get asked for 15% rebate essentially on those products, that compares to the 7.5% that they had been requesting prior. And then probably more materially for us here, they want to have instead that innovative formulation even if they are protected by patent protection would still be subject to reference pricing. So specifically for us that will -- the rapid dissolving form of Zyprexa while we don't have generic competition in Spain, it has now been what to the reference pricing for the generic olanzapine group broadly. For the insulin competition, this is a sector that we dedicated a lot more focus to over the last couple of years. In particular I would say with the formation of our diabetes business in early 2010. And we intend to maintain that focus on that business. We have said before we are seeing that if it is more competitive, I think -- is seeing a more competitive Lilly and as we would expect, they're going to react and I would say though, while the influence business is one that is extremely important, it's going to be a very large part of overall diabetes treatment market, one that we intend to go ahead and very competitive in. Our goal of regaining leadership over time in diabetes is not predicated solely on insulin. It really doesn't encompass the glut space as well as the --. So our focus on building that broad-based portfolio and leveraging that is intact and we'll continue to execute that really diligently. Trajenta is really very early days, you may also be referring to the decision made in Germany where there were some very difficult comparables being applied to what the government would like to reimburse the product that did not make it appropriate for Boehringer Ingelheim or Lilly to move forward at this time. We definitely do anticipate we'll be able to reach some agreement with a government that provides this product to patients and also recognizes innovation benefit that it brings and compensates Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly.

In regards to the animal health organic growth, it was about 18% in the quarter. As we think about Q4 and the U.S. Zyprexa sales, as you know, we do not provide product level projections are forecast. But what you could anticipate when we think about just returns, we probably took about 1/3 of the impact and anticipate an impact in the third quarter. And we would anticipate about another 60% impact of returns in the fourth quarter. Clearly, as you have we go through the brunt of the erosion, the initial phase of the U.S. erosion curb. In regards to SG&A expenses, if you look at the third quarter, it was really driven by 3 elements, if you look at our total OpEx growth. FX was about 3 percentage points. The remaining 2 items was the pharma fixed fee okay, and the third was the expenses both in SG&A as well as R&D behind our BI collaboration. If you exclude those 3 items, our expense growth in the quarter was essentially flat, so 0. In fact, it was slightly negative in real terms. So when you think, projecting forward we're not at a stage of putting out guidance beyond this period from a line item standpoint. But what you can expect is we're going to be managing our SG&A very tightly okay."

I think when you couple the ongoing healthcare reform with the reduction focus in terms of patent reform, it's a huge win. It should in the medium to long-term restore a great deal of confidence for investors that our patents can be -- can remain valid, can be enforced and can be the basis for investor confidence in addition to clearing this huge backlog. I think there is still strong support for maintaining 12.5 years of data protection, for biologics, which is part of the affordable care act and it's the law and we want to keep it that way. And I think there's a general recognition appreciation to the fact that this industry employs directly and indirectly between 3 and 4 million people in this country. And it's the only way we're going to attack diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, which not only cause suffering but help drive up a lot of the healthcare cost today and in the future. I think the area of concern for us right now is Part D. We're fighting and we're quite adamant in our opposition to imposing government price controls in Part D. This is a program that's working, premiums for seniors have remained low. The overall cost of the program is stunningly lower than any one forecast 5 or 6 years ago. And most seniors in Part D today have access to medicine. In terms of deficit reduction, party is making a difference in there too. A recent study published show that for every person enrolled in Part D, they have $1,200 a year less costs in other parts of the medical delivery system. That's more than $10 billion a year in savings and I think we have to attribute to the programs currently structured so we're going to continue to make sure that that message gets heard and understood as we go forward we will continue as well to express concerns we have about IPAD, the independent payment advisory board, as well as the way this 340 B program is being expanded, we believe, inappropriately."

In terms of the exposure on the dual eligible low income subsidy, today we have not provided a specific quantification. I guess one thing I would push it to consider is your Tranche A bracket how large this could be. For the original healthcare reform that was $80 billion cost of the industry over a 10-year period, we'd actually estimate is probably closer to $115 billion cost over that 10-year period of the industry. And as we talked about earlier, we've estimated, you're probably talking about a $600 million to $700 million cost to Lilly in 2011 from healthcare reform. Numbers I've seen from the CBO I guess who scored Medicare, dual eligible low-income subsidy going to Medicaid pricing, I believe they scored this around $105 billion, $110 billion over a 10-year period.

During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined on latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed for Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Let's begin with a recap of events since our Q2 earnings call. With multiple developments on the regulatory front, the European Commission granted final approval for Trajenta for adults with type 2 diabetes. EU launches have begun starting with the U.K. Launches in other European countries are expected over the balance of 2011 and the first half of 2012. Despite initial impact, we hope to reach an agreement with local authorities that allows Trajenta to be made available to German patients. 
The FDA approved Cialis for once-daily use for the treatment of men who have signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, and men who have both erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat both ED and BPH. 
Just last night, the FDA approved BYETTA for use with insulin glargine. Europe's CHMP issued a positive opinion for use of ALIMTA as a continuation maintenance therapy in patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer after initial treatment with ALIMTA plus cisplatin.  We expect EC approval during Q4. 
Along with Amylin and Alkermes, we submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Bydureon, and the FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of January 28, 2012. We also submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Amyvid, a PET imaging agent under investigation for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brains of living patients. And finally, we submitted the sBLA for ERBITUX in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. 
On the business development front, we entered into 2 different agreements to bolster our diabetes presence in EMEA. First, we entered into collaboration with Lupin Limited, under which Lupin will promote Humulin in India and Nepal. And we expanded our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to include co-promotion Linagliptin by Lilly and copromotion of Humalog by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Also, in earlier stage of this development initiative, we launched a new platform called Open Innovation Drug Discovery to both build our own pipeline and identify molecules that may be useful in the treatment of multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. 
On the legal front, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Lilly's favor in the Strattera patent case, overturning a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey and upholding the Strattera method-of-use patent, which will expire in May 2017.  The defendants filed a motion for rehearing on en banc and earlier this week, the court denied their request. 
Lastly, an important news for our industry and for Lilly. The America Invents Act was signed into law. Not only will this new law align U.S. patent laws more closely to those of other countries, but we believe, it will improve U.S. competitiveness by: reducing the backlog of patent applications, enhancing the quality of issued patents; and providing greater certainty for those that invest in innovation. 
Now for the background, Ronika will discuss our Q3 financial results and provide our pipeline update. And then Derica will cover our financial guidance for 2011 and key events for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. Ronika?"

As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. We'll also provide commentary on our Q3 results, excluding the effect of headwinds that were highlighted in previous discussions of both our quarterly performance and our 2011 guidance. 
I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q3 income statement. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth in this quarter, excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effective U.S. healthcare reform, revenue would have grown 15%. Compared to Q3 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points to 78.2%. This decrease is primarily due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and to a lesser extent, a negative mix effect. 
Operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 13%, while the increase in R&D was 5%.  Drivers of the increase in operating expenses included cost related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial expense; the effective changes in foreign exchange rates as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturing fee associated with U.S. healthcare reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform and the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance, operating expenses would have grown 3%, with this amount entirely driven by foreign exchange. 
Other income and deductions was a net expense of $83.4 million this quarter, which was higher than last year. The higher net expense was due to a partial write-down and the IPR&D value of Amyvid due to a revised assumption for the timing of a potential regulatory approval and sales uptake. 
Our tax rate was 17.9% this quarter or 4.6 percentage points lower than Q3 2010.  The largest item driving this reduction is the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $45.4 million, primarily as a result of a resolution of the company's 2007 IRS tax audit. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 7% from $1.21 to $1.13. Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw a robust EPS growth in our business in Q3, excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effective Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes alliance.  Excluding these items, EPS would have grown in the mid-20% range. 
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 4%. This quarter, foreign exchange was -- also contributed 4%, while price had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue growth. 
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 countercyclical engines: Japan, animal health and emerging market. In total, these businesses delivered 15% volume growth in the quarter. Volume growth continued to be strong in Japan at 20%, driven by recent launches of both Cymbalta and Forteo. Elanco animal health volume grew 22% in Q3, driven primarily by organic growth, including increased demand for our food animal products and the continued expansion of our companion animal business.  The launch of Trifexis in the U.S. has been particularly robust. To a lesser extent, this volume growth was driven by the acquisition of certain enhancements and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe. 
Finally, embedded within the rest of the world line, our emerging markets revenue grew 7% in volume and 5% overall. Although the growth in emerging markets moderated relative to previous quarters, particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 22% in volume and 31% overall. 
This quarter, FX had a significant effect on EPS. Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of our select line item of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without effects of changes in foreign exchange rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on the last column on Page 6. Let's focus on the second column of numbers, which strip out the effect of foreign exchange. 
First, you'll see that the 4% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin grew 8% and 3%, respectively. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expense grew 7%, excluding FX. As mentioned earlier, the increase was driven entirely by the Boehringer Ingelheim deal and the pharmaceutical industry fees. 
Continuing on, you'll see that excluding FX, operating income declined 2% and EPS declined 1%. So you can clearly see that FX had a significant negative effect on EPS this quarter, lowering EPS growth by 6 percentage points to negative 7%. In other words, a favorable effect of FX on our foreign operating income was more than offset by the negative effect of FX on inventories sold. Excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and investments related to the BI diabetes alliance, EPS would have grown in the mid-20s. 
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of the same items of our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our new molecular entities in clinical development as of October 10, inclusive of changes since our July update. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 66 distinct NMEs, including 34 compounds in Phase II and Phase III.  Biotechnology represents half of our Phase II and Phase III assets as well as nearly half of our overall clinical portfolio. We continue to make progress in advancing our pipeline. 
Since July, we began Phase III testing of our new insulin glargine products, and we now have 10 distinct compounds in Phase III testing, with 2 more likely to begin before year end.  We advanced 3 assets in the Phase II testing, including our Myostatin monoclonal antibody that Jan Lundberg discussed at our June investment committee meeting. We advanced 2 assets in the Phase I testing, and we terminated or suspended development of 6 assets across our Phase I and Phase II portfolio. 
In summary, we have already achieved our goal of having 10 NMEs in Phase III by year end. With Phase III starts expected this quarter for our innovative basal analog influence and for Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody for psoriasis, we could finish this year with 12 NMEs in Phase III testing. 
We're pleased with our progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality, mid- to late-stage pipeline, with many potential opportunities to advance patient care in diseases with large unmet need, as well as significant commercial opportunity. As outlined at our Investment Community Meeting in June, we believe our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"

Now clearly, this patent exploration, which",1620,"Thanks, Ronika. Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how the Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your models. Now clearly, this patent exploration, which is essentially a U.S. and European phenomenon, will negatively affect our revenue and income, causing our fourth quarter results to differ substantially from those we posted September year-to-date. 
We lost the Zyprexa patent in most European countries last month. This coming Sunday, October 23, we'll lose patent protection for Zyprexa here in the U.S. Now as you might expect, during Q3, we saw the initial impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration. Specifically, we saw some reduction in wholesaler purchases in anticipation of reduced future sales of branded Zyprexa.  In addition, we also made accruals to account for the potential future return of products that were sold to wholesalers during the third quarter. 
In European markets, we've already seen multiple generic companies enter the various markets, offering very large discounts. For example, in Germany, there are about 20 generic players, and the initial generic pricing came in at about a 75% discount to Zyprexa's pre-patent expiry price.  
Now here in the U.S., while we expect rapid and significant erosion of the branded Zyprexa sale, the competitive dynamic will be a bit different, as we will have a single generic company marketing each presentation of olanzapine for the first 6 months, post patent expiration.  Also, as part of our late life-cycle planning, we've entered into an authorized generic agreement here in the U.S. with Prasco to allow them to market a generic version of olanzapine. Now upon expiration of the 6-month exclusivity period in late April of 2012, we would expect additional companies to market their own generic olanzapine, leading to further sales erosion of Zyprexa. 
In summary, on the revenue line, we expect to see a significant negative impact in Q4. This is reflected in the fact that our worldwide revenue had grown 8% September year-to-date, while our full year guidance for 2011 is for revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As you think about the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration on other line items of our income statement, you should keep in mind a few items. We do not expect Zyprexa-related manufacturing expenses to decrease at the same rate as sales. While there will be some savings of variable production costs, other fixed costs that had been absorbed by the production of Zyprexa will remain.  As a result, the expected decline of Zyprexa sales will put downward pressure in our gross margin as a percent of revenue. This is why we forecast gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year 2011 to be between 78% and 79%, despite the fact that it is at 79.5% for the first 9 months of the year. 
Now in terms of marketing and selling expenses, we currently have very little variable marketing spend behind Zyprexa during this late stage of its life cycle.  Consequently, there will be minimal marketing savings post patent expiration. The major spend behind Zyprexa has been the sales force. 
Now you should not expect to see a significant reduction in sales force expense as a result of the Zyprexa patent expiration for 2 main reasons. First, beginning in late 2009, we restructured our U.S. and then our European neuroscience sales forces. Among other factors, this restructuring took into account the CNS sales footprint needed post Zyprexa patent expiration. Second, keep in mind that Cymbalta's sold by these same sales forces, and we committed to providing a competitive detailing effort behind this very important brand.
In a nutshell, our strategy for managing costs, leading up to the Zyprexa patent expiration has been to act early and not wait until the event itself was upon us. Since 2004, we've been reducing headcount and driving productivity improvements across all areas of our business. And since 2009, we've upped the pace of rightsizing our organization for the post-Zyprexa period, significantly restructuring everything from our senior management layers to our back-office operation to our sales and marketing organization.  
As a result of these efforts, we fully expect to meet our goal of reducing our expenses by $1 billion by the end of this year. This will essentially complete our restructuring effort. While we will continue to drive incremental productivity, we have no plans for a major restructuring. Hopefully, this additional color commentary on the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration is helpful as you update your models. 
Now let's review our updated 2011 financial guidance. At a high level, our updated guidance is very consistent with the guidance we issued on our July earnings call. It reflects continued strong underlying performance of our business. It also includes the discrete tax benefit and the additional charges recorded in Q3. In total, these changes result in an increase and narrowing of our EPS guidance. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we now expect 2011 EPS of between $4.30 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.89 to $3.94 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge for the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance and $0.18 in restructuring recharges in the first 9 months of the year. 
Our guidance on individual line items is largely unchanged. Revenue is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, and the gross margin as a percent of revenue it is still expected to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points when compared to the full year of 2010. SG&A growth is still expected to be in high-single digits, and R&D growth is still expected to be in the low-single digits. Our guidance for other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $175 million to $225 million, reflecting the partial impairment of the acquired in-process R&D asset related to Amyvid. 
As a result of the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter, we now expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 19.5% on a reported basis. And we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million. 
Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. In terms of key future events, highlights for the balance of 2011 include potential FDA approval of ERBITUX for first-line head and neck cancer; the anticipated European Commission approval of ALIMTA as continuation maintenance therapy in non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer; expected Phase III starts for our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis. This would bring our Phase III portfolio to 12 new molecular entities, exceeding our goal of 10. 
We also expect to present key Phase II data on our CETP inhibitor at the American Heart Association meeting in November, as well as for our anti-IL-17 and RA at the ACR meeting also in November.  And in psoriasis at the Jane D. Clinic [ph] meeting in London in December. 
Now in the interest of time, I will not recite the full list of potential events for 2012. But as you can see, we have a significant number of -- we have a significant number of potential regulatory actions, Phase III trial completions and potential data disclosures.  We are clearly excited about the year ahead and are pleased with the progress we continue to make in advancing our pipeline. This will remain our #1 priority. 
Now as I mentioned on our July earnings call, 2011 is playing out largely as we had expected. We delivered a solid financial result, as we head into the Zyprexa patent expiration, and importantly, we are making progress in advancing our pipeline.  
As expected, in Q3 we saw the impact of known headwinds, including patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan, U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost in 2011 than it did in 2010 and near-term dilution from expenses associated with our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim.  Now, while these headwinds negatively affected our Q3 results, we again delivered strong underlying growth in the rest of our business. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 15%, operating expense growth of 3% and mid-20s percent EPS growth. 
As you think about our future revenue, you'll clearly need to factor in the patent expiration of Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe. But I also like to highlight that in Q3, our countercyclical growth engine of Japan, emerging markets and animal health collectively grew 19%. And we had a number of key brands that posted double-digit worldwide revenue growth, including Cymbalta, Humalog, Strattera, Forteo, Cialis and ALIMTA. 
We've already achieved our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of the year. And we expect to begin Phase III testing of our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis before year end. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-Years YZ.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on executing our 3-part strategy as we stated in June. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline, and for innovation-based biopharmaceutical company, this is our future. Second, investing to drive growth in our countercyclical growth engines and key currently marketed brands, particularly, those that do not lose patent protection in the YZ period. And third, continue to drive productivity gains across our business that allow us to fund R&D necessary to fuel our future growth, recapitalize our physical assets and maintain our dividend. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

So specifically for us, Velatab [ph], the rapid dissolving form of Zyprexa, while we not have generic competition in Spain, it probably has now been pegged to the reference pricing for the generic olanzapine group broadly. For the insulin competition, this is a sector that we dedicated a lot more focus to over the last couple of years, in particular, I'd say, with the formation of our diabetes business in early 2010. And we intend to maintain that focus on that business. And we have said before, we are seeing that, if it is more competitive, I think, know those and I see a [ph] more competitive Lilly. And as we would expect, they're going to react. And I would say though, while the influence business is one that is extremely important, it's going to be a very large part of the overall diabetes treatment market, one that we intend to go ahead and be very competitive in. Our goal of regaining leadership over time in diabetes is not predicated solely on insulin. It really does encompass the glut space as well as orals. So our focus on building that broad-based portfolio and leveraging that is intact, and we'll continue to execute that very diligently. Trajenta is really very early days. You may have been also referring to the decision made in Germany, where there were some very difficult comparables being applied to what the government does. If possible, we would like to reimburse the product, but it did not make it appropriate for Boehringer Ingelheim or Lilly to move forward at this time. We definitely do anticipate we'll be able to reach some agreement with the government that provides this product to patients and also recognizes innovation, the benefits that it brings and the appropriate  compensates Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. So we remain very optimistic about this class and about this product. Again, very early days in Europe on this particular front."

So this clearly positions us to offer products that go from earlier stages with the oral treatments into the injectable phases with glut initially, and then, obviously, you've got people who eventually will progress to and will need them for a therapy, and obviously, we have very strong offerings, which we hope to expand in the future with the 2 basals that we're developing. In terms of the combo, to my knowledge there have not been any active discussions. I'm not familiar, Catherine, with the contract.

And is the only way we're going to attack diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, which not only cause immense suffering but help drive up a lot of the healthcare cost today and in the future. I think the area of concern for us right now is Part D. We're fighting, and we're quite adamant in our opposition to imposing government price controls in Part D. This is a program that's working. Premiums for seniors have remained low. The overall cost of program is stunningly lower than any one forecast 5 or 6 years ago. And most seniors in Part D today have access to medicines. In terms of deficit reduction, Part D is making a difference there too. A recent study published in Germany show that for every person enrolled in Part D, they have $1,200 a year less costs in other parts of the medical delivery system. That's more than $10 billion a year in savings. And I think we have to attribute to that program as it's currently structured. So we're going to continue to make sure that, that message gets heard and understood, as we go forward.

During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined on latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed for Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Let's begin with a recap of events since our Q2 earnings call. We had multiple developments on the regulatory front. The European Commission granted final approval for Trajenta for adults with type 2 diabetes. EU launches have begun, starting with the U.K. Launches in other European countries are expected over the balance of 2011 and the first half of 2012. Despite initial impasse, we hope to reach an agreement with local authorities that allows Trajenta to be made available to German patients. 
The FDA approved Cialis for once-daily use for the treatment of men who have signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, and men who have both erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat both ED and BPH. 
Just last night, the FDA approved BYETTA for use with insulin glargine. Europe's CHMP issued a positive opinion for use of ALIMTA as a continuation maintenance therapy in patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer after initial treatment with ALIMTA plus cisplatin.  We expect EC approval during Q4. 
Along with Amylin and Alkermes, we submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Bydureon, and the FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of January 28, 2012. We also submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Amyvid, a PET imaging agent under investigation for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brains of living patients. And finally, we submitted the sBLA for ERBITUX in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. 
On the business development front, we entered into 2 different agreements to bolster our diabetes presence in India. First, we entered into collaboration with Lupin Limited, under which Lupin will promote Humulin in India and Nepal. And we expanded our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to include co-promotion Linagliptin by Lilly and copromotion of Humalog by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Also, in an earlier stage of this development initiative, we launched a new platform, called Open Innovation Drug Discovery, to both build our own pipeline, and identify molecules that may be useful in the treatment of multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. 
On the legal front, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Lilly's favor in the Strattera patent case, overturning a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey and upholding the Strattera method-of-use patent, which will expire in May 2017.  The defendants filed a motion for rehearing en banc, and earlier this week, the court denied their request. 
Lastly, in important news for our industry and for Lilly. The America Invents Act was signed into law. Not only will this new law align U.S. patent laws more closely to those of other countries, but we believe, it will improve U.S. competitiveness by: reducing the backlog of patent applications, enhancing the quality of issued patents; and providing greater certainty for those that invest in innovation. 
Now with background, Ronika will discuss our Q3 financial results and provide our pipeline update. And then Derica will cover our financial guidance for 2011 and key events for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. Ronika?"

As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. We'll also provide commentary on our Q3 results, excluding the effect of headwinds that were highlighted in previous discussions of both our quarterly performance and our 2011 guidance. 
I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q3 income statement. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth in this quarter, excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, revenue would have grown 15%. Compared to Q3 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points to 78.2%. This decrease is primarily due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and to a lesser extent, a negative mix effect. 
Operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 13%, while the increase in R&D was 5%.  Drivers of increase in operating expenses included: costs related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial expense; the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturing fee associated with U.S. healthcare reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform and the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance, operating expenses would have grown 3%, with this amount entirely driven by foreign exchange. 
Other income and deductions was a net expense of $83.4 million this quarter, which was higher than last year. The higher net expense was due to a partial write-down and the IPR&D value of Amyvid, due to a revised assumption for the timing of a potential regulatory approval and sales uptake. 
Our tax rate was 17.9% this quarter or 4.6 percentage points lower than Q3 2010.  The largest item driving this reduction is the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $45.4 million, primarily as a result of a resolution of the company's 2007 IRS tax audit. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 7% from $1.21 to $1.13. Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw robust EPS growth in our business in Q3, excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan, and investments related to the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes alliance.  Excluding these items, EPS would have grown in the mid-20% range. 
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now, let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 4%. This quarter, foreign exchange was -- also contributed 4%, while price had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue growth. 
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 countercyclical engines: Japan, animal health and emerging market. In total, these businesses delivered 15% volume growth in the quarter. Volume growth continued to be strong in Japan at 20%, driven by recent launches of both Cymbalta and Forteo. Elanco Animal Health volume grew 22% in Q3, driven primarily by organic growth, including increased demand for our food animal products and the continued expansion of our companion animal business.  The launch of Trifexis in the U.S. has been particularly robust. To a lesser extent, this volume growth was driven by the acquisition of certain Hanson[ph] and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe. 
Finally, embedded within the rest of world line, our emerging markets revenue grew 7% in volume and 5% overall. Although the growth in emerging markets moderated relative to previous quarters, particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 22% in volume and 31% overall. 
This quarter, FX had a significant effect on EPS. Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of our select line item of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on the last column on Page 6. Let's focus on the second column of numbers, which strip out the effect of foreign exchange. 
First, you'll see that the 4% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin grew 8% and 3%, respectively. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expense grew 7%, excluding FX. As mentioned earlier, the increase was driven entirely by the Boehringer Ingelheim deal and the pharmaceutical industry fees. 
Continuing on, you'll see that excluding FX, operating income declined 2% and EPS declined 1%. So you can clearly see that FX had a significant negative effect on EPS this quarter, lowering EPS growth by 6 percentage points to negative 7%. In other words, a favorable effect of FX on our foreign operating income was more than offset by the negative effect of FX on inventories sold. Excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and the investments related to the BI diabetes alliance, EPS would have grown in the mid-20s. 
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of the same items of our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our new molecular entities in clinical development as of October 10, inclusive of changes since our July update. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 66 distinct NMEs, including 34 compounds in Phase II and Phase III.  Biotechnology represents half of our Phase II and Phase III assets, as well as nearly half of our overall clinical portfolio. We continue to make progress in advancing our pipeline. 
Since July, we began Phase III testing of our new insulin glargine products, and we now have 10 distinct compounds in Phase III testing, with 2 more likely to begin before year end.  We advanced 3 assets in the Phase II testing, including our Myostatin monoclonal antibody that Jan Lundberg discussed at our June investment community meeting. We advanced 2 assets in the Phase I testing, and we terminated or suspended development of 6 assets across our Phase I and Phase II portfolio. 
In summary, we have already achieved our goal of having 10 NMEs in Phase III by year end. With Phase III starts expected this quarter for our innovative basal analog insulin and for Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody for psoriasis, we could finish this year with 12 NMEs in Phase III testing. 
We're pleased with our progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality, mid- to late-stage pipeline, with many potential opportunities to advance patient care in diseases with large unmet need, as well as significant commercial opportunity. As outlined at our Investment Community Meeting in June, we believe our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"

Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how the Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your models. Now clearly, this patent expiration, which",1623,"Thanks, Ronika. Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how the Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your models. Now clearly, this patent expiration, which is essentially a U.S. and European phenomenon, will negatively affect our revenue and income, causing our fourth quarter results to differ substantially from those we posted September year-to-date. 
We lost the Zyprexa patent in most European countries last month. This coming Sunday, October 23, we'll lose patent protection for Zyprexa here in the U.S. Now as you might expect, during Q3, we saw the initial impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration. Specifically, we saw some reduction in wholesaler purchases in anticipation of reduced future sales of branded Zyprexa.  In addition, we also made accruals to account for the potential future return of products that were sold to wholesalers during the third quarter. 
In European markets, we've already seen multiple generic companies enter the various markets, offering very large discounts. For example, in Germany, there are about 20 generic players, and the initial generic pricing came in at about a 75% discount to Zyprexa's pre-patent expiry price.  
Now here in the U.S., while we expect rapid and significant erosion of the branded Zyprexa sale, the competitive dynamic will be a bit different, as we will have a single generic company marketing each presentation of olanzapine for the first 6 months, post patent expiration.  Also, as part of our late life-cycle planning, we've entered into an authorized generic agreement here in the U.S. with Prasco to allow them to market a generic version of olanzapine. Now upon the expiration of the 6-month exclusivity period in late April of 2012, we would expect additional companies to market their own generic olanzapine, leading to further sales erosion of Zyprexa. 
In summary, on the revenue line, we expect to see a significant negative impact in Q4. This is reflected in the fact that our worldwide revenue has grown 8% September year-to-date, while our full year guidance for 2011 is for revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As you think about the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration on other line items of our income statement, you should keep in mind a few items. We do not expect Zyprexa-related manufacturing expenses to decrease at the same rate as sales. While there will be some savings of variable production costs, other fixed costs that had been absorbed by the production of Zyprexa will remain.  As a result, the expected decline of Zyprexa sales will put downward pressure on our gross margin as a percent of revenue. This is why we forecast gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year 2011 to be between 78% and 79%, despite the fact that it is at 79.5% for the first 9 months of the year. 
Now in terms of marketing and selling expenses, we currently have very little variable marketing spend behind Zyprexa during this late stage of its life cycle.  Consequently, there will be minimal marketing savings post patent expiration. The major spend behind Zyprexa has been the sales force. 
Now, you should not expect to see a significant reduction in sales force expense as a result of the Zyprexa patent expiration for 2 main reasons. First, beginning in late 2009, we restructured our U.S. and then our European neuroscience sales forces. Among other factors, this restructuring took into account the CNS sales footprint needed post Zyprexa patent expiration. Second, keep in mind that Cymbalta's sold by these same sales forces, and we remain committed to providing a competitive detailing effort behind this very important brand.
In a nutshell, our strategy for managing costs, leading up to the Zyprexa patent expiration, has been to act early and not wait until the event itself was upon us. Since 2004, we've been reducing headcount and driving productivity improvements across all areas of our business. And since 2009, we've upped the pace of rightsizing our organization for the post-Zyprexa period, significantly restructuring everything from our senior management layers to our back-office operation to our sales and marketing organization.  
As a result of these efforts, we fully expect to meet our goal of reducing our expenses by $1 billion by the end of this year. This will essentially complete our restructuring effort. While we will continue to drive incremental productivity, we have no plans for a major restructuring. Hopefully, this additional color commentary on the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration is helpful as you update your models. 
Now let's review our updated 2011 financial guidance. At a high level, our updated guidance is very consistent with the guidance we issued on our July earnings call. It reflects continued strong underlying performance of our business. It also includes the discrete tax benefit and the additional charges recorded in Q3. In total, these changes result in an increase and narrowing of our EPS guidance. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we now expect 2011 EPS of between $4.30 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.89 to $3.94 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge for the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance and $0.18 in restructuring recharges in the first 9 months of the year. 
Our guidance on individual line items is largely unchanged. Revenue is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, and the gross margin as a percent of revenue it is still expected to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points when compared to the full year of 2010. SG&A growth is still expected to be in high-single digits, and R&D growth is still expected to be in the low-single digits. Our guidance for other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $175 million to $225 million, reflecting the partial impairment of the acquired in-process R&D asset related to Amyvid. 
As a result of the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter, we now expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a non-GAAP basis, and approximately 19.5% on a reported basis. And we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million. 
Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010, and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. In terms of key future events, highlights for the balance of 2011 include: potential FDA approval of ERBITUX for first-line head and neck cancer; the anticipated European Commission approval of ALIMTA as continuation maintenance therapy in non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer; expected Phase III starts for our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis. This would bring our Phase III portfolio to 12 new molecular entities, exceeding our goal of 10. 
We also expect to present key Phase II data on our CETP inhibitor at the American Heart Association meeting in November, as well as for our anti-IL-17 and RA at the ACR meeting, also in November.  And in psoriasis at the Jane D. Clinic [ph] meeting in London in December. 
Now in the interest of time, I will not recite the full list of potential events for 2012. But as you can see, we have made a significant number of -- we have a significant number of potential regulatory actions, Phase III trial completions and potential data disclosures.  We are clearly excited about the year ahead and are pleased with the progress we continue to make in advancing our pipeline. This will remain our #1 priority. 
Now as I mentioned on our July earnings call, 2011 is playing out largely as we had expected. We're delivering solid financial results, as we head into the Zyprexa patent expiration, and importantly, we are making progress in advancing our pipeline.  
As expected, in Q3 we saw the impact of known headwinds, including: patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan, U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost in 2011 than it did in 2010, and near term dilution from expenses associated with our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim.  Now, while these headwinds negatively affected our Q3 results, we again deliver strong underlying growth in the rest of our business. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 15%, operating expense growth of 3% and mid-20s percent EPS growth. 
As you think about our future revenue, you'll clearly need to factor in the patent expiration of Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe. But I also like to highlight that in Q3, our countercyclical growth engines of Japan, emerging markets and animal health collectively grew 19%. And we had a number of key brands that posted double-digit worldwide revenue growth, including: Cymbalta, Humalog, Strattera, Forteo, Cialis and ALIMTA. 
We've already achieved our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of the year. And we expect to begin Phase III testing of our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis before year end. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-Years YZ.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on executing our 3-part strategy as we stated in June. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline, and for innovation-based biopharmaceutical company, this is our future. Second, investing to drive growth in our countercyclical growth engines and key currently marketed brands, particularly those that do not lose patent protection in the YZ period. And third, continue to drive productivity gains across our business that allow us to fund R&D necessary to fuel our future growth, recapitalize our physical assets and maintain our dividend. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

Our future does not depend on any single molecule including solanezumab, there are soon to be 11 other molecules in Phase III. And we'll go where the data takes us and proceed accordingly, but we're really interested in prosecuting and moving forward that entire portfolio."

Before we go to the next caller, as you're thinking about solanezumab, also in relation to the financial projections that we had discussed in Derica's section of the Investment Community Meeting in June, we have said all along this is a high-risk program. It's very interesting science. We're very hopeful of the potential outcome, but we have recognized that it's high risk. Essentially, for the financial modeling, what that means is it's a sign of relatively low probability of actually hitting, if you will. So that means for our financial projections, if that low probability goes to 0, it really does not take them down very much. If on the other hand, it were to go ahead and go from that low probability to 1, it would have a substantial potential upside to those numbers. Hope that's helpful."

Now, obviously, each government is acting at different points in time, but we continue to be able to manage our way through that. As I think about 2012 and 2013, at least in Europe, we still see things playing out more or less along those lines. Probably the biggest question from a pricing standpoint still remains in the U.S., and what emerges from the discussion around the super budget committee and if there's any change as it relates to healthcare reform and dual eligibiles or so forth -- increases in rebate.

They had asked for a 15% rebate essentially on those products, that compares to the 7.5% that they had been requesting prior. And then probably and more materially for us here, they went ahead and said that innovative formulations, even if they are protected by patent protection would still be subject to reference pricing. So specifically for us, Velatab [ph], the rapid dissolving form of Zyprexa, while it will not have generic competition in Spain, it probably has now been pegged to the reference pricing for the generic olanzapine group broadly. For the insulin competition, this is a sector that we've dedicated a lot more focus to over the last couple of years, in particular, I'd say, with the formation of our diabetes business in early 2010. And we intend to maintain that focus on that business. And we have said before, we are seeing -- it is more competitive, I think, Nolos [ph] is now seeing a more competitive Lilly. And as we would expect, they're going to react. And I would say though, while the insulin business is one that is extremely important, it's going to be a very large part of the overall diabetes treatment market, one that we intend to go ahead and be very competitive in. Our goal of regaining leadership over time in diabetes is not predicated solely on insulin. It really does encompass the GLP space as well as orals. So our focus on building that broad-based portfolio and leveraging that is intact, and we'll continue to execute that very diligently. Trajenta is really very early days. You may have been also referring to the decision made in Germany, where there were some very difficult comparables being applied to what the government was espousing it would like to reimburse the product at, that did not make it appropriate for Boehringer Ingelheim or Lilly to move forward at this time. We definitely do anticipate we'll be able to reach some agreement with the government that provides this product to patients and also recognizes innovation, the benefits that it brings and the appropriate  compensates Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. So we remain very optimistic about this class and about this product. Again, very early days in Europe on this particular front."

I think that one of the main things that we have been focused on is the ability to approach the physician and talk about what their patients' needs are, and those patients do have different needs over the course of their disease. So this clearly positions us to offer products that go from earlier stages with the oral treatments into the injectable phases with GLP initially, and then, obviously, you've got people who eventually will progress to, and will need insulin therapy, and obviously, we have very strong offerings, which we hope to expand in the future with the 2 basals that we're developing. In terms of the combo, to my knowledge there have not been any active discussions. I'm not familiar, Catherine, enough with the contract.

Now, how's that going to continue to play out and how will other products that don't fall in that category be affected remains to be seen. But actually, in contrast to some other parts of the world, we actually see in the last 2 years and going forward a more favorable pricing environment in Japan as the government there recognizes the need to call out innovation and to value innovation, and also continues with its intent to ensure that more medicines that are approved in Europe and the U.S. are approved and made available to Japanese patients in a contemporaneous way."

I think when you couple the ongoing healthcare reform with the debts of reduction focus in terms of wins, patent reform is a huge win. It should in the medium- to long-term restore a great deal of confidence for investors that our patents can be -- can remain valid, can be enforced and can be the basis for investor confidence in addition to clearing this huge backlog. I think there is still strong support for maintaining 12.5 years of data protection, for biologics, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, and we -- it's the law, and we want to keep it that way. And I think there's a general recognition, appreciation to the fact that this industry employs directly and indirectly between 3 and 4 million people in this country. And is the only way we're going to attack diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, which not only cause immense suffering, but help drive up a lot of the healthcare cost today and in the future. I think the area of concern for us right now is Part D. We're fighting, and we're quite adamant in our opposition to imposing government price controls in Part D. This is a program that's working. Premiums for seniors have remained low. The overall cost of the program is stunningly lower than any one forecast 5 or 6 years ago. And most seniors in Part D today have access to medicines. In terms of deficit reduction, Part D is making a difference there too. A recent study published in Jamma [ph] show that for every person enrolled in Part D, they have $1,200 a year less costs in other parts of the medical delivery system. That's more than $10 billion a year in savings that I think we have to attribute to that program as it's currently structured. So we're going to continue to make sure that, that message gets heard and understood, as we go forward. We'll continue as well to express concerns we have about IPAB, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, as well as the way the 340 B program is being expanded,  we believe, inappropriately."

During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined on latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed for Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Let's begin with a recap of events since our Q2 earnings call. We had multiple developments on the regulatory front. The European Commission granted final approval for Trajenta for adults with type 2 diabetes. EU launches have begun, starting with the U.K. Launches in other European countries are expected over the balance of 2011 and the first half of 2012. Despite initial impasse, we hope to reach an agreement with local authorities that allows Trajenta to be made available to German patients. 
The FDA approved Cialis for once-daily use for the treatment of men who have signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, and men who have both erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat both ED and BPH. 
Just last night, the FDA approved BYETTA for use with insulin glargine. Europe's CHMP issued a positive opinion for use of ALIMTA as a continuation maintenance therapy in patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer after initial treatment with ALIMTA plus cisplatin.  We expect EC approval during Q4. 
Along with Amylin and Alkermes, we submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Bydureon, and the FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of January 28, 2012. We also submitted our reply to the FDA's Complete Response Letter for Amyvid, a PET imaging agent under investigation for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brains of living patients. And finally, we submitted the sBLA for ERBITUX in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. 
On the business development front, we entered into 2 different agreements to bolster our diabetes presence in India. First, we entered into collaboration with Lupin Limited, under which Lupin will promote Humulin in India and Nepal. And we expanded our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to include co-promotion Linagliptin by Lilly and copromotion of Humalog by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Also, in an earlier stage of this development initiative, we launched a new platform, called Open Innovation Drug Discovery, to both build our own pipeline, and identify molecules that may be useful in the treatment of multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. 
On the legal front, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Lilly's favor in the Strattera patent case, overturning a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey and upholding the Strattera method-of-use patent, which will expire in May 2017.  The defendants filed a motion for rehearing en banc, and earlier this week, the court denied their request. 
Lastly, in important news for our industry and for Lilly. The America Invents Act was signed into law. Not only will this new law align U.S. patent laws more closely to those of other countries, but we believe, it will improve U.S. competitiveness by: reducing the backlog of patent applications, enhancing the quality of issued patents; and providing greater certainty for those that invest in innovation. 
Now with background, Ronika will discuss our Q3 financial results and provide our pipeline update. And then Derica will cover our financial guidance for 2011 and key events for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. Ronika?"

As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. We'll also provide commentary on our Q3 results, excluding the effect of headwinds that were highlighted in previous discussions of both our quarterly performance and our 2011 guidance. 
I'll start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our Q3 income statement. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated robust revenue growth in this quarter, excluding Gemzar outside of Japan and the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, revenue would have grown 15%. Compared to Q3 2010, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points to 78.2%. This decrease is primarily due to the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and to a lesser extent, a negative mix effect. 
Operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew 10% this quarter. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A, which increased 13%, while the increase in R&D was 5%.  Drivers of increase in operating expenses included: costs related to our diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial expense; the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as the pharmaceutical manufacturing fee associated with U.S. healthcare reform, which was roughly $45 million. Excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform and the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance, operating expenses would have grown 3%, with this amount entirely driven by foreign exchange. 
Other income and deductions was a net expense of $83.4 million this quarter, which was higher than last year. The higher net expense was due to a partial write-down and the IPR&D value of Amyvid, due to a revised assumption for the timing of a potential regulatory approval and sales uptake. 
Our tax rate was 17.9% this quarter or 4.6 percentage points lower than Q3 2010.  The largest item driving this reduction is the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $45.4 million, primarily as a result of a resolution of the company's 2007 IRS tax audit. 
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 7% from $1.21 to $1.13. Consistent with the 2011 guidance we provided in January, we saw robust EPS growth in our business in Q3, excluding U.S. healthcare reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan, and investments related to the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes alliance.  Excluding these items, EPS would have grown in the mid-20% range. 
Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. 
Now, let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 revenue. As you can see on Slide 9, total revenue growth of 9% was again driven by solid volume growth of 4%. This quarter, foreign exchange was -- also contributed 4%, while price had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue growth. 
We continue to see strong volume growth from our 3 countercyclical engines: Japan, animal health and emerging market. In total, these businesses delivered 15% volume growth in the quarter. Volume growth continued to be strong in Japan at 20%, driven by recent launches of both Cymbalta and Forteo. Elanco Animal Health volume grew 22% in Q3, driven primarily by organic growth, including increased demand for our food animal products and the continued expansion of our companion animal business.  The launch of Trifexis in the U.S. has been particularly robust. To a lesser extent, this volume growth was driven by the acquisition of certain Hanson[ph] and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe. 
Finally, embedded within the rest of world line, our emerging markets revenue grew 7% in volume and 5% overall. Although the growth in emerging markets moderated relative to previous quarters, particularly noteworthy was China's revenue growth of 22% in volume and 31% overall. 
This quarter, FX had a significant effect on EPS. Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of our select line item of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on the last column on Page 6. Let's focus on the second column of numbers, which strip out the effect of foreign exchange. 
First, you'll see that the 4% growth in revenue I mentioned earlier. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and gross margin grew 8% and 3%, respectively. This is consistent with the statement that the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. In total, operating expense grew 7%, excluding FX. As mentioned earlier, the increase was driven entirely by the Boehringer Ingelheim deal and the pharmaceutical industry fees. 
Continuing on, you'll see that excluding FX, operating income declined 2% and EPS declined 1%. So you can clearly see that FX had a significant negative effect on EPS this quarter, lowering EPS growth by 6 percentage points to negative 7%. In other words, a favorable effect of FX on our foreign operating income was more than offset by the negative effect of FX on inventories sold. Excluding U.S. health care reform, the effect of Gemzar patent expiration outside of Japan and the investments related to the BI diabetes alliance, EPS would have grown in the mid-20s. 
On Slide 11, you'll find year-on-year growth of the same items of our income statement on a reported basis, both with and without FX. Now before turning the call over to Derica, let me provide a brief update on our pipeline. 
On Slide 12, you'll find a view of our new molecular entities in clinical development as of October 10, inclusive of changes since our July update. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 66 distinct NMEs, including 34 compounds in Phase II and Phase III.  Biotechnology represents half of our Phase II and Phase III assets, as well as nearly half of our overall clinical portfolio. We continue to make progress in advancing our pipeline. 
Since July, we began Phase III testing of our new insulin glargine products, and we now have 10 distinct compounds in Phase III testing, with 2 more likely to begin before year end.  We advanced 3 assets in the Phase II testing, including our Myostatin monoclonal antibody that Jan Lundberg discussed at our June investment community meeting. We advanced 2 assets in the Phase I testing, and we terminated or suspended development of 6 assets across our Phase I and Phase II portfolio. 
In summary, we have already achieved our goal of having 10 NMEs in Phase III by year end. With Phase III starts expected this quarter for our innovative basal analog insulin and for Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody for psoriasis, we could finish this year with 12 NMEs in Phase III testing. 
We're pleased with our progress we've made, building a robust, high-quality, mid- to late-stage pipeline, with many potential opportunities to advance patient care in diseases with large unmet need, as well as significant commercial opportunity. As outlined at our Investment Community Meeting in June, we believe our current pipeline provides the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-2014. Derica?"

Now clearly, this patent expiration, which",1623,"Thanks, Ronika. Before providing our updated guidance, I would like to talk through how the Zyprexa patent expiration will affect our income statement. This may be particularly helpful as you update your models. Now clearly, this patent expiration, which is essentially a U.S. and European phenomenon, will negatively affect our revenue and income, causing our fourth quarter results to differ substantially from those we posted September year-to-date. 
We lost the Zyprexa patent in most European countries last month. This coming Sunday, October 23, we'll lose patent protection for Zyprexa here in the U.S. Now as you might expect, during Q3, we saw the initial impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration. Specifically, we saw some reduction in wholesaler purchases in anticipation of reduced future sales of branded Zyprexa.  In addition, we also made accruals to account for the potential future return of products that were sold to wholesalers during the third quarter. 
In European markets, we've already seen multiple generic companies enter the various markets, offering very large discounts. For example, in Germany, there are about 20 generic players, and the initial generic pricing came in at about a 75% discount to Zyprexa's pre-patent expiry price.  
Now here in the U.S., while we expect rapid and significant erosion of the branded Zyprexa sale, the competitive dynamic will be a bit different, as we will have a single generic company marketing each presentation of olanzapine for the first 6 months, post patent expiration.  Also, as part of our late life-cycle planning, we've entered into an authorized generic agreement here in the U.S. with Prasco to allow them to market a generic version of olanzapine. Now upon the expiration of the 6-month exclusivity period in late April of 2012, we would expect additional companies to market their own generic olanzapine, leading to further sales erosion of Zyprexa. 
In summary, on the revenue line, we expect to see a significant negative impact in Q4. This is reflected in the fact that our worldwide revenue has grown 8% September year-to-date, while our full year guidance for 2011 is for revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As you think about the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration on other line items of our income statement, you should keep in mind a few items. We do not expect Zyprexa-related manufacturing expenses to decrease at the same rate as sales. While there will be some savings of variable production costs, other fixed costs that had been absorbed by the production of Zyprexa will remain.  As a result, the expected decline of Zyprexa sales will put downward pressure on our gross margin as a percent of revenue. This is why we forecast gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year 2011 to be between 78% and 79%, despite the fact that it is at 79.5% for the first 9 months of the year. 
Now in terms of marketing and selling expenses, we currently have very little variable marketing spend behind Zyprexa during this late stage of its life cycle.  Consequently, there will be minimal marketing savings post patent expiration. The major spend behind Zyprexa has been the sales force. 
Now, you should not expect to see a significant reduction in sales force expense as a result of the Zyprexa patent expiration for 2 main reasons. First, beginning in late 2009, we restructured our U.S. and then our European neuroscience sales forces. Among other factors, this restructuring took into account the CNS sales footprint needed post Zyprexa patent expiration. Second, keep in mind that Cymbalta's sold by these same sales forces, and we remain committed to providing a competitive detailing effort behind this very important brand.
In a nutshell, our strategy for managing costs, leading up to the Zyprexa patent expiration, has been to act early and not wait until the event itself was upon us. Since 2004, we've been reducing headcount and driving productivity improvements across all areas of our business. And since 2009, we've upped the pace of rightsizing our organization for the post-Zyprexa period, significantly restructuring everything from our senior management layers to our back-office operation to our sales and marketing organization.  
As a result of these efforts, we fully expect to meet our goal of reducing our expenses by $1 billion by the end of this year. This will essentially complete our restructuring effort. While we will continue to drive incremental productivity, we have no plans for a major restructuring. Hopefully, this additional color commentary on the impact of the Zyprexa patent expiration is helpful as you update your models. 
Now let's review our updated 2011 financial guidance. At a high level, our updated guidance is very consistent with the guidance we issued on our July earnings call. It reflects continued strong underlying performance of our business. It also includes the discrete tax benefit and the additional charges recorded in Q3. In total, these changes result in an increase and narrowing of our EPS guidance. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we now expect 2011 EPS of between $4.30 and $4.35. Our 2011 reported EPS guidance range of $3.89 to $3.94 reflects the $0.23 IPR&D charge for the Boehringer Ingelheim alliance and $0.18 in restructuring recharges in the first 9 months of the year. 
Our guidance on individual line items is largely unchanged. Revenue is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, and the gross margin as a percent of revenue it is still expected to decline by 2 to 3 percentage points when compared to the full year of 2010. SG&A growth is still expected to be in high-single digits, and R&D growth is still expected to be in the low-single digits. Our guidance for other income is now forecast to be a net loss in the range of $175 million to $225 million, reflecting the partial impairment of the acquired in-process R&D asset related to Amyvid. 
As a result of the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter, we now expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a non-GAAP basis, and approximately 19.5% on a reported basis. And we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million. 
Now Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2010, and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2011 guidance. In terms of key future events, highlights for the balance of 2011 include: potential FDA approval of ERBITUX for first-line head and neck cancer; the anticipated European Commission approval of ALIMTA as continuation maintenance therapy in non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer; expected Phase III starts for our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis. This would bring our Phase III portfolio to 12 new molecular entities, exceeding our goal of 10. 
We also expect to present key Phase II data on our CETP inhibitor at the American Heart Association meeting in November, as well as for our anti-IL-17 and RA at the ACR meeting, also in November.  And in psoriasis at the Jane D. Clinic [ph] meeting in London in December. 
Now in the interest of time, I will not recite the full list of potential events for 2012. But as you can see, we have made a significant number of -- we have a significant number of potential regulatory actions, Phase III trial completions and potential data disclosures.  We are clearly excited about the year ahead and are pleased with the progress we continue to make in advancing our pipeline. This will remain our #1 priority. 
Now as I mentioned on our July earnings call, 2011 is playing out largely as we had expected. We're delivering solid financial results, as we head into the Zyprexa patent expiration, and importantly, we are making progress in advancing our pipeline.  
As expected, in Q3 we saw the impact of known headwinds, including: patent expirations that are lowering sales of Gemzar outside of Japan, U.S. health care reform, which is exacting a higher cost in 2011 than it did in 2010, and near term dilution from expenses associated with our strategic diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim.  Now, while these headwinds negatively affected our Q3 results, we again deliver strong underlying growth in the rest of our business. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, we posted revenue growth of 15%, operating expense growth of 3% and mid-20s percent EPS growth. 
As you think about our future revenue, you'll clearly need to factor in the patent expiration of Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe. But I also like to highlight that in Q3, our countercyclical growth engines of Japan, emerging markets and animal health collectively grew 19%. And we had a number of key brands that posted double-digit worldwide revenue growth, including: Cymbalta, Humalog, Strattera, Forteo, Cialis and ALIMTA. 
We've already achieved our goal of having 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of the year. And we expect to begin Phase III testing of our innovative basal analog insulin and our anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis before year end. We firmly believe that our current pipeline serves as the foundation for Lilly to return to growth post-Years YZ.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on executing our 3-part strategy as we stated in June. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline, and for innovation-based biopharmaceutical company, this is our future. Second, investing to drive growth in our countercyclical growth engines and key currently marketed brands, particularly those that do not lose patent protection in the YZ period. And third, continue to drive productivity gains across our business that allow us to fund R&D necessary to fuel our future growth, recapitalize our physical assets and maintain our dividend. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

It's very interesting science. We're very hopeful of the potential outcome, but we have recognized that it's high risk. Essentially, for the financial modeling, what that means is it's a sign of relatively low probability of actually hitting, if you will. So that means for our financial projections, if that low probability goes to 0, it really does not take them down very much. If on the other hand, it were to go ahead and go from that low probability to 1, it would have a substantial potential upside to those numbers. Hope that's helpful."

As I think about 2012 and 2013, at least in Europe, we still see things playing out more or less along those lines. Probably the biggest question from a pricing standpoint still remains in the U.S., and what emerges from the discussion around the super budget committee and if there's any change as it relates to healthcare reform and dual eligibiles or so forth -- increases in rebate.

They had asked for a 15% rebate essentially on those products, that compares to the 7.5% that they had been requesting prior. And then probably and more materially for us here, they went ahead and said that innovative formulations, even if they are protected by patent protection would still be subject to reference pricing. So specifically for us, Velatab [ph], the rapid dissolving form of Zyprexa, while it will not have generic competition in Spain, it probably has now been pegged to the reference pricing for the generic olanzapine group broadly. For the insulin competition, this is a sector that we've dedicated a lot more focus to over the last couple of years, in particular, I'd say, with the formation of our diabetes business in early 2010. And we intend to maintain that focus on that business. And we have said before, we are seeing -- it is more competitive, I think, Nolos [ph] is now seeing a more competitive Lilly. And as we would expect, they're going to react. And I would say though, while the insulin business is one that is extremely important, it's going to be a very large part of the overall diabetes treatment market, one that we intend to go ahead and be very competitive in. Our goal of regaining leadership over time in diabetes is not predicated solely on insulin. It really does encompass the GLP space as well as orals. So our focus on building that broad-based portfolio and leveraging that is intact, and we'll continue to execute that very diligently. Trajenta is really very early days. You may have been also referring to the decision made in Germany, where there were some very difficult comparables being applied to what the government was espousing it would like to reimburse the product at, that did not make it appropriate for Boehringer Ingelheim or Lilly to move forward at this time. We definitely do anticipate we'll be able to reach some agreement with the government that provides this product to patients and also recognizes innovation, the benefits that it brings and the appropriate  compensates Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. So we remain very optimistic about this class and about this product. Again, very early days in Europe on this particular front."

So this clearly positions us to offer products that go from earlier stages with the oral treatments into the injectable phases with GLP initially, and then, obviously, you've got people who eventually will progress to, and will need insulin therapy, and obviously, we have very strong offerings, which we hope to expand in the future with the 2 basals that we're developing. In terms of the combo, to my knowledge there have not been any active discussions. I'm not familiar, Catherine, enough with the contract. I would think if you introduced another molecule into that collaboration, we would need to probably have some discussions to figure out how that would work, as the current collaboration really is focused on the exenatide molecule whether that's BYETTA, Bydureon or subsequent formulation."

Cymbalta will see a very different picture in the U.S. This is a brand in a very competitive, highly genericized market, with less clinical differentiation in the minds of physicians. We do plan on having a robust sales and marketing effort, much closer to the loss of exclusivity, and therefore, as you think about modeling after LOE, there will be a more significant expense impact post LOE with Cymbalta."

I think when you couple the ongoing healthcare reform with the debts of reduction focus in terms of wins, patent reform is a huge win. It should in the medium- to long-term restore a great deal of confidence for investors that our patents can be -- can remain valid, can be enforced and can be the basis for investor confidence in addition to clearing this huge backlog. I think there is still strong support for maintaining 12.5 years of data protection, for biologics, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, and we -- it's the law, and we want to keep it that way. And I think there's a general recognition, appreciation to the fact that this industry employs directly and indirectly between 3 and 4 million people in this country. And is the only way we're going to attack diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, which not only cause immense suffering, but help drive up a lot of the healthcare cost today and in the future. I think the area of concern for us right now is Part D. We're fighting, and we're quite adamant in our opposition to imposing government price controls in Part D. This is a program that's working. Premiums for seniors have remained low. The overall cost of the program is stunningly lower than any one forecast 5 or 6 years ago. And most seniors in Part D today have access to medicines. In terms of deficit reduction, Part D is making a difference there too. A recent study published in Jamma [ph] show that for every person enrolled in Part D, they have $1,200 a year less costs in other parts of the medical delivery system. That's more than $10 billion a year in savings that I think we have to attribute to that program as it's currently structured. So we're going to continue to make sure that, that message gets heard and understood, as we go forward. We'll continue as well to express concerns we have about IPAB, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, as well as the way the 340 B program is being expanded,  we believe, inappropriately."
