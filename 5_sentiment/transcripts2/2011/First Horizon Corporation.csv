Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Fourth quarter and full-year 2010 demonstrated our continued strategic progress.

Fourth quarter and full-year 2010 demonstrated our continued strategic progress. We made significant headway on our key priorities and goals for the year. We returned to profitability, significantly improved credit quality, structured our balance sheet for growth, repositioned our core businesses and repaid TARP while maintaining our strong capital position.
During 2010, pretax income increased from 2009 driven by solid performance of our core businesses. We're pleased with our 2010 accomplishments and feel good about our 2011 prospects. In 2011, our focus will be on growing our businesses, improving productivity and efficiency and continuing to proactively deal with credit. We're encouraged by the recent signs of an improving economy, but we expect a slow economic recovery, and low interest rates are likely to persist.
In this kind of environment, controlling cost is important. We spent the last year making investments to become more efficient. We've upgraded systems and streamlined and improve processes. We'll continue with these efforts in 2011, as BJ will discuss in a few minutes. But the bottom line is, we're starting 2011 as a more productive and efficient company, and expect to make additional progress this year. We've also been taking steps to ensure that our core businesses of Regional Banking and Capital Markets are positioned to take advantage of opportunities in an improving economy. Again, I'm pleased with the progress we're making and believe we're beginning the year with competitive advantages.
Customer service will remain a primary focus in 2011 as we work to deepen and expand our customer relationships. Our efforts are already paying off with average core deposits up 9% in 2010 and net checking accounts growing 2%. New consumer loan production was up 5% from last year.
Although our Non-Strategic loans continue to run off, the Regional Banks' loan portfolio is benefiting from our sales force and active calling program. During 2010, we hired 20 bankers and made 34,000 outbound calls to commercial customers. Our loan pipeline has stabilized. We've started to see C&I growth driven by our corporate customers, particularly in asset-based lending where loans were up 11% from last year.
We're also seeing opportunities in commercial real estate, as we have capacity in this asset class. Pricing terms are favorable in the CRE sector as we book loans with experienced borrowers with good track records. We will continue to actively pursue new business in 2011 while maintaining credit and pricing discipline.
Turning to our Capital Markets business. We expect continued strong returns in 2011. Over the past year, we've added new accounts and made a number of strategic hires that should help further expand our extensive distribution platform. However, fixed income revenues are likely to continue to reflect the normalizing of market conditions.
To sum up, we believe we're on our front foot for 2011. We recognize that the operating and regulatory environments present challenges. Out of these challenges will come opportunities, and we're set to take advantage of the opportunities. With our industry-leading capital ratios, we have the flexibility to deploy capital, take advantage of both internal and external opportunities. 
To that point, we recently declared our return to a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share. We still have more work to do, but we're confident in our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and to achieve our long-term goal of maximizing shareholder returns. 
I'll be back for some closing comments, but BJ will now take you through the detailed financial review. BJ?"

I'll start on Slide 5 with some highlights and significant items for the quarter. As Bryan mentioned, our net loss available to common was $0.20 with the $63 million impact of TARP-related charges. Net income from continuing operations is $",1454,"Thanks, Bryan. I'll start on Slide 5 with some highlights and significant items for the quarter. As Bryan mentioned, our net loss available to common was $0.20 with the $63 million impact of TARP-related charges. Net income from continuing operations is $17 million, with core businesses solid pretax income of $89 million. Loan loss provision decreased for the second consecutive quarter with charge offs down for the sixth. NPAs, as Greg will talk to you about a minute, down 9% linked-quarter. Mortgage repurchase provision expense decreased to $44 million in the quarter as our expected rescission and [indiscernible] rates remained fairly steady, and no private securitization request and no new securitization litigation occurred in the quarter. And our capital ratios, as Bryan mentioned, remained strong after TARP repayment and our successful common equity offering.
Two significant items in the quarter, in addition to TARP repayment, you'll see in our numbers in our Non-Strategic segment, we had a decrease in our net hedging results declining to positive $7 million from last quarter's $32 million. We did execute a sale of a portion of our Class B Visa shares, about $15 million reduction of our Visa contingent liability over a part of it of $8 million and some various restructuring and repositioning expenses for a net change quarter-to-quarter of $4 million.
Turning to Slide 6,. the consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter, in addition to provision at $45 million being down for the seventh consecutive quarter, we saw a modest decline in NII, noninterest income at $211 million of Capital Markets fixed income revenue while solid was lower than 3Q. And as discussed, mortgage hedge results were lower as well. Expenses were down to $335 million as both Core Business and Non-Strategic segment expenses declined in the quarter. In conjunction with our TARP retirement, we raised a net $263 million in common equity, issued $500 million in senior debt at the holding company and announced the redemption of $100 million of our trust preferreds. Due to the capital raise in the fourth quarter, you'll note that we added 26.3 million shares.
Turning to Slide 7. Pretax income for our core businesses of Regional Banks, Capital Markets and Corporate was $88.6 million in the fourth quarter, with consolidated pretax income of $13 million. Regional Banks pretax income improved to $60 million, a 24% increase from last quarter, driven primarily by lower provision expense. Linked-quarter provision in the bank decreased by $8 million to $2 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the bank was up 1% from last quarter. NII improved 2% from higher loan fees and the recognition of interest income on previously  nonperforming assets, and fees were relatively stable.
In our Capital Markets segment, pretax income declined to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter as fixed income revenues decreased from lower volumes. Fixed income average daily revenue was at $1.4 million, down from third quarter's $1.7 million. Expenses declined 3% from lower variable comp, which was somewhat offset by higher legal and professional fees. Fourth quarter's ADR was indicative of ongoing normalizing market conditions, which we currently expect to continue into 2011.
Pretax income in our Corporate segment was $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, up from last quarter's loss of $14.4 million. The improvement was mostly driven by the securities gain of $14.8 million from the sale of a portion of our Visa shares and an unrelated $8 million contract expense related to the reversal of a Visa contingent liability. Those gains were diminished by the $5.4 million of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency charges.
In our Non-Strategic segment, linked-quarter mortgage net hedge results declined 78% to $7 million as we experienced rate volatility and a rapid increase in spreads. 
For the full year, consolidated expenses decreased 13% from '09 to '10 from lower environmental cost as foreclosure expense and mortgage repurchase provision declined as reflected in the Non-Strategic segment's 19% decline in expenses. We expect that our 2011 expenses should be lower than 2010. Over the next year, we plan to improve our efficiency by working to become more productive and improve our cost structure. As we've discussed in the past, we are focused on taking cost out of the organization by looking both vertically, meaning within lines of business and support groups, and horizontally across the organization at things like cost per branch, cost per loan and cost per service to streamline processes and reduce expenses monthly.
Turning to Slide 8. Our mortgage repurchase reserve was $183 million at the end of the fourth quarter, and our mortgage repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $44 million. The pipeline increased 14% from last quarter to $534 million. Although the inflow of request increased $54 million to $263 million, resolutions were up as well, 34% to $196 million. Net realized losses were flat at $36 million. Although our rescission rate was higher in the month of December, it remains within the range of 40% to 50%, and severity was stable at 50% to 60%. The majority of requests are still in the '07 vintage, but we're starting to see the mix shift towards the '08 originations as the amount of new requests between the '07 and the '08 vintages were about equal in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we sold our mortgage platform in August of 2009. In fourth quarter, the majority of our pipeline of requests was GSE related. In light of some of the GSE-related mortgage we purchase settlement we've seen in the industry, we are examining potential courses of action for our company.
We still have not seen any requests from our private securitizations, and we are not aware of being named in any lawsuits regarding the privates other than those we reported last quarter. We continue to believe that the risks in the private should be manageable.
Turning to Slide 9. Consolidated net interest margin was at 318, a decline of five basis points from the third quarter. The NIM compression was driven primarily by the excess Fed balances, which had a 17 basis point negative impact on our margin in the fourth quarter compared to a 13 basis point drag in the third. Also lower yields from the Securities and Trading portfolios in mortgage loans and the Non-Strategic portfolio contributed to the quarter's lower NIM. Core business NIM was solid at 3.56%. We continue to see better loan pricing as yields were up one basis point from last quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. The weighted average cost of core deposits declined four basis points to 70 basis points linked-quarter and decreased 20 basis points year-over-year.
Over the next year, assuming rates remain low and loan growth stays muted, we currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable, although we could see modest up or down movement over the course of the year absent any Fed rate increases. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated average core deposits rose 1% linked-quarter. Average loans on a consolidated basis fell 1% as Non-Strategic loans dropped 6%. The Regional Bank posted a 1% increase in average loans driven by increased lending activity in Corporate Lending, Asset-based Lending and Business Banking despite fourth quarter's reduction in mortgage warehouse lending. Period end, our Securities portfolio was up to $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We added about $400 million as we delayed fully funding the portfolio until rates were moderately more favorable towards the end of the quarter. Going forward, we expect the size of the Securities portfolio to stay relatively stable, although it may fluctuate if we take advantage of opportunities to buy securities at attractive yields and structures.
Turning to Slide 10. You'll see we've made significant progress with our balance sheet positioning and profitability, as Bryan mentioned, particularly in our core business segments. Full-year pretax income of our core businesses at the bank, Capital Markets and Corporate improved to $257 million, a 76% increase from '09's $146 million. Additionally, our pretax loss in our Non-Strategic segment dropped from $567 million in '09 to $270 million in 2010 as a significant reduction in credit losses more than offset increases in mortgage repurchase related expenses.
As Bryan said, we believe we're entering 2011 on our front foot, and we're well prepared to take advantage of growth opportunities. However, environmental and regulatory pressures, both revenue and expense related, including volatility in our mortgage repurchase pipeline and reserve will remain with us in 2011. While further improvement in credit-related cost is expected to benefit profitability, the rate of improvement is likely to slow.
In short, we're pleased with the progress and feel good about the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

We've seen some good progress in credit quality as our proactive approach paid off. Year-over-year, net charge-offs declined 45%, NPAs were down 20% and provision expense dropped nearly 70%. 
I'll discuss NPAs on Slide 13. Linked-quarter, we saw a decline of 9% driven by fewer additions, more payments as well as improved performance in the Regional Bank's C&I portfolio from fewer downgrades and more upgrades. ORE balances also declined due to more sales and fewer additions. 
I'll talk about the portfolio highlights on Slide 14 starting with our income CRE portfolio. Linked quarter, charge-offs increased by $6 million to $13 million from note sales and valuation write-downs in the fourth quarter. NPLs were relatively flat from last quarter. In the fourth quarter, the hospitality industry showed some stress but other sectors in our CRE portfolio remained stable. We expect continued stress as more borrowers come up for renewal, however, headwinds seem to be somewhat moderating in our markets as we're seeing less downgrade activity. Reserves were relatively flat at 9%. 
Our C&I portfolio showed improving trends as charge-offs declined to $14 million. NPLs were down by $31 million. The decrease was from large credits coming off of nonaccrual status as well as overall improvement for more upgrades and fewer downgrades. Our C&I portfolio also includes our TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities], bank holding company and other bank-related loans. Seven bank TruPS are on deferral in the fourth quarter. Although financial institutions generally remained stressed, we've experienced some stabilization over the past few quarters. At this stage of the credit cycle, we anticipate the C&I portfolio's credit trends should be stable to improving.
Our Home Equity portfolio's credit trends remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Linked quarter, charge-offs decreased 7% to $42 million, and 30-day delinquency was stable at 2.3%. Linked-quarter NPLs increased by $6 million to $32 million, which included a large consumer credit in the Regional Bank and reflected a higher number of modifications as we work with our borrowers reserves were flat at $150 million.
I will wrap up on Slide 15. 2010 showed significant improvement in credit quality as NPAs decline, charge-offs decreased and reserves were down. In 2011, assuming a stable to gradually improving economy, we expect a continued decline in credit cost, although we could experience quarter-to-quarter volatility, especially in our Commercial portfolios. And as BJ mentioned, the rate of credit improvement will likely slow. 
I'll now turn it over to Bryan for some closing comments."

We also have lower reinvestment rates that we're taking on the Securities portfolio as we reinvest there. So it's kind of the positives offsetting the negatives in 2011. The little bit of upside could be if we continue to reduce the excess balances that we have at the Fed, that's been a significant drag, but we've got to figure out ways to put it to work.

You'd also see some moderation in the variable-related expenses on Capital Markets should they continue to normalize, as well as some of the efficiency efforts that we have ongoing. To give you some more specifics as you asked about what we're doing, we have about 250 benchmarks across the organization that we have in each and every one of our businesses that we're looking at to drive improved performance. And so, it's a clear stake in the ground for our folks that run our businesses to say, there are peers that do it better or different this way and how can we improve that. And so, they're going through that on things like cost per branch, direct versus allocated cost per branch, cost per loan, cost per deposit, marketing spend per branch, financial center profitability, direct P&L profitability of our sales forces. So breaking that down and de-averaging that, looking at our staffing models, both front line and back-office. And so we've got a heck of a lot of different ways that we're looking at taking costs out of the organization. As I've talked about, we really want to do it smartly so that it comes out permanently. And we think the best way to do that is by systemically each and every quarter continuing to see that reduction come out. And you should be able to see that in our core businesses going into 2011."

If you think back about the progression that we've been through as an organization over the last several years, clearly, a lot of focus on getting credit quality, systems and processes, and attacking asset quality problems, we spent a lot of time in the last year, year and a half, implementing business model changes, system changes, business model changes like line of business approach, systems changes that will make us more efficient. And as BJ said, we've got a lot of metrics. We're being very driven by the metrics. And although this is not a target-driven process, we want it to be cultural. It's an opportunity. We think there's $100 million-plus of expense opportunity reduction for us in this organization. So we're not -- I say that in the context if somebody is going to ask me about $100 million four quarters from now and the kind of progress, we want it to be about doing it right, doing it smartly, protecting our customer base and our customer service, our revenue stream, but getting more effective and efficient.

But also, I think everything you said is correct. But if I talk to our guys on the floor, I think what's occurring particularly in our depository institution clients is that they are just not making decisions on putting money to work, that they are sending Fed funds upstream. And we've seen that in our Fed funds purchase from downstream correspondence. That there's a big buildup there, excess balances at the Fed. Just taking what they can get and keeping the cash short-term because they're just afraid of getting caught upside down on a trade that they put on in the bond portfolio that could go the other way for them. And if you think about the smaller community banks, a little bit less sophistication, it's very difficult to make decisions about going long in the bond portfolio, it's much safer for them to just make no decision and keep it very short."

And so I think those two things will help you get into the right area about the valuation.

What we've seen in the Regional Bank is in the C&I portfolio. And specifically, if we kind of go through the different C&I portfolios in terms of the Corporate segment, which includes our asset-based lending, that was really the first that we saw borrowers really stabilize and heal and it's followed after that the Commercial segment and we see now, especially in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter, some business banking clients also feeling more confident. And so, part of what we've seen through the year and certainly the momentum pickup in the last two quarters is the grades improving as companies have stabilized. So we kind of continue to expect to see that and specifically, when we start to see 2010 year end numbers of clients in the second quarter, we'd expect that to continue kind of the good news. So I think in looking at the regional bank along those lines and obviously about 90% of our income CRE sets in the Regional Bank as well. As that portfolio, to be frank, it's behaving a little bit better than I thought it might so far. And I hope I continue to be wrong in that perspective, that it will continue to improve. We're seeing actually within that client set, as I mentioned before, stabilization of properties and therefore, of sponsors as well. So I think as kind of in a long-term basis, we go back to our bone fish, which is public in terms of how I think that portfolio stabilizes. It's obviously increasing the credit quality quarter-over-quarter and we'd expect that to continue. Any given quarter, we may have a large client that may cause a number to go up or not. But the overall improvement, I think, continues as the economy heals, as the clients kind of right size themselves to their balance sheets and are able to maneuver in the new economy, slower growth environment."

I'm going to take this opportunity as we're talking about the Regional Bank, as sort of back up to the question Brian Foran asked earlier in the call about pretax pre-provision earnings in the core business and talk about some of the impacts on that in the Regional Bank over what is likely to play out in 2011, 2012. We've said for a pretty long period of time, we think that our balance sheet, assuming $25 billion plus or minus balance sheet, that we ought to be able to produce in the area of $125 million of pretax pre-provision. I talked about our efforts to pick up operational efficiencies, the environmental cause that are still impacting us will continue to come down. And so, we really haven't moved from being that area in terms of targeted pretax, pre-provision in the business. In the shorter term, we're going to be impacted by the implementation of Dodd-Frank, most notably the Durbin Amendment. If you took un-adjusted or unOffset, you're probably looking at the interchange rules impacting us by about $30 million on an annual basis, $30 million annually. So a lot of that will be offset, as we restructure products, as we restructure fees around those products. And so we'll offset a fair amount of that. But that kind of volatility will be introduced into our business as well as everybody else in the sector over the next year or so. So as you think about the banking business, as credit is improving, as the economy is healing, we will see some normalization but you're going to see other catalyst that make it hard to forecast, which don't make it any easier for those of you in the call building models, but it is going to be hard to forecast the timing of all of these things over the next year or year plus."

If you think about what that portfolio represents, it is a higher credit quality Home Equity portfolio, but it does have lower spreads that a lot of Home Equity portfolios might have. Because it tended to be a prime modest portfolio reflecting the credit quality. So to the extent that runs down, it doesn't take $1 of growth in the core bank at the margins we can produce in our core banking business to offset that from a net interest income perspective. So we expect the trend to continue. We expect to be able to offset the vast majority of it as we grow our core banking business.

Fourth quarter and full-year 2010 demonstrated our continued strategic progress. We made significant headway on our key priorities and goals for the year. We returned to profitability, significantly improved credit quality, structured our balance sheet for growth, repositioned our core businesses and repaid TARP while maintaining our strong capital position.
During 2010, pretax income increased from 2009 driven by solid performance of our core businesses. We're pleased with our 2010 accomplishments and feel good about our 2011 prospects. In 2011, our focus will be on growing our businesses, improving productivity and efficiency and continuing to proactively deal with credit. We're encouraged by recent signs of an improving economy, but we expect a slow economic recovery, and low interest rates are likely to persist.
In this kind of environment, controlling cost is important. We spent the last year making investments to become more efficient. We've upgraded systems and streamlined and improved processes. We'll continue with these efforts in 2011, as BJ will discuss in a few minutes. But the bottom line is, we're starting 2011 as a more productive and efficient company, and expect to make additional progress this year. We've also been taking steps to ensure that our core businesses of Regional Banking and Capital Markets are positioned to take advantage of opportunities in an improving economy. Again, I'm pleased with the progress we're making and believe we're beginning the year with competitive advantages.
Customer service will remain a primary focus in 2011 as we work to deepen and expand our customer relationships. Our efforts are already paying off with average core deposits up 9% in 2010 and net checking accounts growing 2%. New consumer loan production was up 5% from last year.
Although our Non-Strategic loans continue to run off, the Regional Bank's loan portfolio is benefiting from our sales force and active calling program. During 2010, we hired 20 bankers and made 34,000 outbound calls to commercial customers. Our loan pipeline has stabilized. We've started to see C&I growth driven by our corporate customers, particularly in asset-based lending where loans were up 11% from last year.
We're also seeing opportunities in commercial real estate, as we have capacity in this asset class. Pricing terms are favorable in the CRE sector as we book loans with experienced borrowers with good track records. We will continue to actively pursue new business in 2011 while maintaining credit and pricing discipline.
Turning to our Capital Markets business, we expect continued strong returns in 2011. Over the past year, we've added new accounts and made a number of strategic hires that should help further expand our extensive distribution platform. However, fixed income revenues are likely to continue to reflect the normalizing of market conditions.
To sum up, we believe we're on our front foot for 2011. We recognize that the operating and regulatory environments present challenges. Out of these challenges will come opportunities, and we're set to take advantage of the opportunities. With our industry-leading capital ratios, we have the flexibility to deploy capital, take advantage of both internal and external opportunities. 
To that point, we recently declared our return to a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share. We still have work to do, but we're confident in our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and to achieve our long-term goal of maximizing shareholder returns. 
I'll be back for some closing comments, but BJ will now take you through the detailed financial review. BJ?"

I'll start on Slide 5 with some highlights and significant items for the quarter. As Bryan mentioned, our net loss available to common was $0.20 with the $63 million impact of TARP-related charges. Net income from continuing operations at $",1454,"Thanks, Bryan. I'll start on Slide 5 with some highlights and significant items for the quarter. As Bryan mentioned, our net loss available to common was $0.20 with the $63 million impact of TARP-related charges. Net income from continuing operations at $17 million, with core businesses' solid pretax income of $89 million. Loan loss provision decreased for the second consecutive quarter with charge offs down for the sixth. NPAs, as Greg will talk to you about in a minute, down 9% linked-quarter. Mortgage repurchase provision expense decreased to $44 million in the quarter as our expected rescission and severity rates remained fairly steady, and no private securitization requests and no new securitization litigation occurred in the quarter. And our capital ratios, as Bryan mentioned, remained strong after TARP repayment and our successful common equity offering.
Two significant items in the quarter, in addition to TARP repayment, you'll see in our numbers in our Non-Strategic segment, we had a decrease in our net hedging results declining to positive $7 million from last quarter's $32 million. We did execute a sale of a portion of our Class B Visa shares, about $15 million reduction of our Visa contingent liability over a part of it of $8 million and some various restructuring and repositioning expenses for a net change quarter-to-quarter of $4 million.
Turning to Slide 6, the consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter, in addition to Provision at $45 million being down for the seventh consecutive quarter, we saw a modest decline in NII, noninterest income at $211 million as Capital Markets fixed income revenue, while solid, was lower than 3Q. And as discussed, mortgage hedge results were lower as well. Expenses were down to $335 million as both Core Business and Non-Strategic segment expenses declined in the quarter. In conjunction with our TARP retirement, we raised a net $263 million in common equity, issued $500 million in senior debt at the holding company and announced the redemption of $100 million of our trust preferreds. Due to the capital raise in the fourth quarter, you'll note that we added 26.3 million shares.
Turning to Slide 7, pretax income for our core businesses of Regional Bank, Capital Markets and Corporate was $88.6 million in the fourth quarter, with consolidated pretax income of $13 million. Regional Bank's pretax income improved to $60 million, a 24% increase from last quarter, driven primarily by lower provision expense. Linked-quarter provision in the bank decreased by $8 million to $2 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the bank was up 1% from last quarter. NII improved 2% from higher loan fees and the recognition of interest income on previously nonperforming assets, and fees were relatively stable.
In our Capital Markets segment, pretax income declined to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter as fixed income revenues decreased from lower volumes. Fixed income average daily revenue was at $1.4 million, down from third quarter's $1.7 million. Expenses declined 3% from lower variable comp, which was somewhat offset by higher legal and professional fees. Fourth quarter's ADR was indicative of ongoing normalizing market conditions, which we currently expect to continue into 2011.
Pretax income in our Corporate segment was $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, up from last quarter's loss of $14.4 million. The improvement was mostly driven by the securities gain of $14.8 million from the sale of a portion of our Visa shares and an unrelated $8 million contra expense related to the reversal of a Visa contingent liability. Those gains were diminished by the $5.4 million of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency charges.
In our Non-Strategic segment, linked-quarter mortgage net hedge results declined 78% to $7 million as we experienced rate volatility and a rapid increase in spreads. 
For the full year, consolidated expenses decreased 13% from '09 to '10 from lower environmental cost as foreclosure expense and mortgage repurchase provision declined as reflected in the Non-Strategic segment's 19% decline in expenses. We expect that our 2011 expenses should be lower than 2010. Over the next year, we plan to improve our efficiency by working to become more productive and improve our cost structure. As we've discussed in the past, we are focused on taking cost out of the organization by looking both vertically, meaning within lines of business and support groups, and horizontally across the organization at things like cost per branch, cost per loan and cost to service to streamline processes and reduce expenses smartly.
Turning to Slide 8, our mortgage repurchase reserve was $183 million at the end of the fourth quarter, and our mortgage repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $44 million. The pipeline increased 14% from last quarter to $534 million. Although the inflow of requests increased $54 million to $263 million, resolutions were up as well, 34% to $196 million. Net realized losses were flat at $36 million. Although our rescission rate was higher in the month of December, it remained within the range of 40% to 50%, and severity was stable at 50% to 60%. The majority of requests are still in the '07 vintage, but we're starting to see the mix shift towards the '08 originations as the amount of new requests between the '07 and the '08 vintages were about equal in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we sold our mortgage platform in August of 2008. In fourth quarter, the majority of our pipeline of requests was GSE-related. In light of some of the GSE-related mortgage we purchase settlements we've seen in the industry, we are examining potential courses of action for our company.
We still have not seen any requests from our private securitizations, and we are not aware of being named in any lawsuits regarding the privates other than those we reported last quarter. We continue to believe that the risk from the privates should be manageable.
Turning to Slide 9, consolidated net interest margin was at 3.18%, a decline of five basis points from the third quarter. The NIM compression was driven primarily by the excess Fed balances, which had a 17 basis point negative impact on our margin in the fourth quarter compared to a 13 basis point drag in the third. Also lower yields from the Securities and Trading portfolios in mortgage loans and the Non-Strategic portfolio contributed to the quarter's lower NIM. Core business NIM was solid at 3.56%. We continue to see better loan pricing as yields were up one basis point from last quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. The weighted average cost of core deposits declined four basis points to 70 basis points linked-quarter and decreased 20 basis points year-over-year.
Over the next year, assuming rates remain low and loan growth stays muted, we currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable, although we could see modest up or down movement over the course of the year absent any Fed rate increases. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated average core deposits rose 1% linked-quarter. Average loans on a consolidated basis fell 1% as Non-Strategic loans dropped 6%. The Regional Bank posted a 1% increase in average loans driven by increased lending activity in Corporate Lending, Asset-based Lending and Business Banking despite fourth quarter's reduction in mortgage warehouse lending. Period end, our Securities portfolio was up to $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We added about $400 million as we delayed fully funding the portfolio until rates were moderately more favorable towards the end of the quarter. Going forward, we expect the size of the Securities portfolio to stay relatively stable, although it may fluctuate if we take advantage of opportunities to buy securities at attractive yields and structures.
Turning to Slide 10. You'll see we've made significant progress with our balance sheet positioning and profitability, as Bryan mentioned, particularly in our core business segments. Full-year pretax income of our core businesses at the bank, Capital Markets and Corporate improved to $257 million, a 76% increase from '09's $146 million. Additionally, our pretax loss in our Non-Strategic segment dropped from $567 million in '09 to $207 million in 2010 as a significant reduction in credit losses more than offset increases in mortgage repurchase related expenses.
As Bryan said, we believe we're entering 2011 on our front foot, and we're well prepared to take advantage of growth opportunities. However, environmental and regulatory pressures, both revenue and expense related, including volatility in our mortgage repurchase pipeline and reserve will remain with us in 2011. While further improvement in credit-related costs is expected to benefit profitability, the rate of improvement is likely to slow.
In short, we're pleased with the progress and feel good about the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

We've seen some good progress in credit quality as our proactive approach paid off. Year-over-year, net charge-offs declined 45%, NPAs were down 20% and provision expense dropped nearly 70%. 
I'll discuss NPAs on Slide 13. Linked-quarter, we saw a decline of 9% driven by fewer additions, more payments as well as improved performance in the Regional Bank's C&I portfolio from fewer downgrades and more upgrades. ORE balances also declined due to more sales and fewer additions. 
I'll talk about the portfolio highlights on Slide 14 starting with our income CRE portfolio. Linked quarter, charge-offs increased by $6 million to $13 million from note sales and valuation write-downs in the fourth quarter. NPLs were relatively flat from last quarter. In the fourth quarter, the hospitality industry showed some stress but other sectors in our CRE portfolio remained stable. We expect continued stress as more borrowers come up for renewal, however, headwinds seem to be somewhat moderating in our markets as we're seeing less downgrade activity. Reserves were relatively flat at 9%. 
Our C&I portfolio showed improving trends as charge-offs declined to $14 million. NPLs were down by $31 million. The decrease was from large credits coming off of nonaccrual status as well as overall improvement for more upgrades and fewer downgrades. Our C&I portfolio also includes our TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities], bank holding company and other bank-related loans. Seven bank TruPS are on deferral in the fourth quarter. Although financial institutions generally remained stressed, we've experienced some stabilization over the past few quarters. At this stage of the credit cycle, we anticipate the C&I portfolio's credit trends should be stable to improving.
Our Home Equity portfolio's credit trends remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Linked quarter, charge-offs decreased 7% to $42 million, and 30-day delinquency was stable at 2.3%. Linked-quarter NPLs increased by $6 million to $32 million, which included a large consumer credit in the Regional Bank and reflected a higher number of modifications as we work with our borrowers. Reserves were flat at $150 million.
I will wrap up on Slide 15. 2010 showed significant improvement in credit quality as NPAs declined, charge-offs decreased and reserves were down. In 2011, assuming a stable to gradually improving economy, we expect a continued decline in credit cost, although we could experience quarter-to-quarter volatility, especially in our Commercial portfolios. And as BJ mentioned, the rate of credit improvement will likely slow. 
I'll now turn it over to Bryan for some closing comments."

You'd also see some moderation in the variable-related expenses on Capital Markets should they continue to normalize, as well as some of the efficiency efforts that we have ongoing. To give you some more specifics as you asked about what we're doing, we have about 250 benchmarks across the organization that we have in each and every one of our businesses that we're looking at to drive improved performance. And so it's a clear stake in the ground for our folks that run our businesses to say, there are peers that do it better or different this way and how can we improve that. And so, they're going through that on things like cost per branch, direct versus allocated cost per branch, cost per loan, cost per deposit, marketing spend per branch, financial center profitability, direct P&L profitability of our sales forces. So breaking that down and de-averaging that, looking at our staffing models, both front line and back-office. And so we've got a heck of a lot of different ways that we're looking at taking costs out of the organization. As I've talked about, we really want to do it smartly so that it comes out permanently. And we think the best way to do that is by systemically each and every quarter continuing to see that reduction come out. And you should be able to see that in our core businesses going into 2011."

And as BJ said, we've got a lot of metrics. We're being very driven by the metrics. And although this is not a target-driven process, we want it to be cultural. It's an opportunity. We think there's $100 million-plus of expense opportunity reduction for us in this organization. So we're not -- I say that in the context that somebody is going to ask me about the $100 million four quarters from now and the kind of progress, we want it to be about doing it right, doing it smartly, protecting our customer base and our customer service, our revenue stream, but getting more effective and efficient.

But also, I think everything you said is correct. But if I talk to our guys on the floor, I think what's occurring particularly in our depository institution clients is that they are just not making decisions on putting money to work, that they are sending Fed funds upstream. And we've seen that in our Fed funds purchase from downstream correspondence. That there's a big buildup there, excess balances at the Fed. Just taking what they can get and keeping the cash short-term because they're just afraid of getting caught upside down on a trade that they put on in the bond portfolio that could go the other way for them. And if you think about the smaller community banks, a little bit less sophistication, it's very difficult to make decisions about going long in the bond portfolio, it's much safer for them to just make no decision and keep it very short."

We think it's probably north of 7% in what I would define as the near-term range. As I said earlier, we're north of 8.5%, so we have a real strong capital base relative to that. So it's a significant amount of capital that we think can be redeployed in the business over a period of time. I do think that patience around it is important. I think discipline around how we redeploy that capital is important.

What we've seen in the Regional Bank is in the C&I portfolio. And specifically, if we kind of go through the different C&I portfolios in terms of the Corporate segment, which includes our asset-based lending, that was really the first that we saw borrowers really stabilize and heal and it's followed after that the Commercial segment and we see now, especially in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter, some business banking clients also feeling more confident. And so, part of what we've seen through the year and certainly the momentum pickup in the last two quarters is the grades improving as companies have stabilized. So we'd kind of continue to expect to see that and specifically, when we start to see 2010 year end numbers of clients in the second quarter, we'd expect that to continue, kind of, the good news. So I think in looking at the Regional Bank along those lines and obviously about 90% of our income CRE sits in the Regional Bank as well. As that portfolio, to be frank, it's behaving a little bit better than I thought it might so far. And I hope I continue to be wrong in that perspective, that it will continue to improve. We're seeing actually within that client set, as I mentioned before, stabilization of properties and therefore, of sponsors as well. So I think as kind of in a long-term basis, we go back to our bonefish, which is public, in terms of how I think that portfolio stabilizes. It's obviously increasing the credit quality quarter-over-quarter and we'd expect that to continue. Any given quarter, we may have a large client that may cause a number to go up or not. But the overall improvement, I think, continues as the economy heals, as the clients kind of right-size themselves to their balance sheets and are able to maneuver in the new economy, slower growth environment."

I'm going to take this opportunity as we're talking about the Regional Bank, to sort of back up to the question Brian Foran asked earlier in the call about pretax pre-provision earnings in the core business and talk about some of the impacts on that in the Regional Bank over what is likely to play out in 2011, 2012. We've said for a pretty long period of time, we think that our balance sheet, assuming $25 billion plus or minus on our balance sheet, that we ought to be able to produce in the area of $125 million of pretax pre-provision. I talked about our efforts to pick up operational efficiencies, the environmental costs that are still impacting us will continue to come down. And so, we really haven't moved from being in that area in terms of targeted pretax, pre-provision in the business. In the shorter term, we're going to be impacted by the implementation of Dodd-Frank, most notably the Durbin Amendment. If you took unadjusted or un-offset, you're probably looking at the interchange rules impacting us by about $30 million on an annual basis, $30 million annually. So a lot of that will be offset, as we restructure products, as we restructure fees around those products. And so we'll offset a fair amount of that. But that kind of volatility will be introduced into our business as well as everybody else in the sector over the next year or so. So as you think about the banking business, as credit is improving, as the economy is healing, we will see some normalization but you're going to see other catalysts that make it hard to forecast, which don't make it any easier for those of you on the call building models, but it is going to be hard to forecast the timing of all of these things over the next year, year plus."

As we've thought about it, and as we work on it, I think one way to think about it is as that runs off it's being replaced and will be replaced by growth opportunities in the core banking business. If you think about what that portfolio represents, it is a higher credit quality Home Equity portfolio, but it does have lower spreads than a lot of Home Equity portfolios might have because it tended to be a prime-minus portfolio reflecting the credit quality. So to the extent that runs down, it doesn't take $1 of growth in the core bank at the margins we can produce in our core banking business to offset that from a net interest income perspective. So we expect the trend to continue. We expect to be able to offset the vast majority of it as we grow our core banking business around the corporate, commercial real estate and the consumer lending, we're able to do there."

I'm pleased with the progress we've made. Our core business has showed solid performance. We made good headway in our efficiency initiatives. Credit quality improved notably and we maintained our strong capital position. In other words, we are executing on our key priorities for 2011, and getting back to blocking and tackling.
Ask first quarter results show, we are gradually optimizing our business mix, taking steps to build our high return Regional Banks and Capital Markets businesses while continuing to wind down to lower margin on our strategic segment. The Regional Banks pretax income rose 4% linked quarter, and moved from a pretax loss to a pretax profit year-over-year. Capital Markets performance remains solid. The Non-Strategic segment continue to be less of a drag on our overall results.
Our proactive steps to identify and provide for problem credits are paying off, as we were able to sharply reduce the loan loss provision as credit trends improved. In fact, the Regional Bank booked a provision credit in the first quarter. At quarter's end, we maintained a reserve of 3.7% of total loans.
Revenue trends in the Regional Bank are also encouraging despite ongoing environmental challenges. Linked quarter revenues declined from unfavorable seasonal impact from lower NSF fees, shorter date counts and a lower level of our assets. Our bankers intensified calling efforts, along with emphasis on customer service, are helping us deepen and expand profitable customer relationships.
The Regional Banks loan activity has been good. As a result, we are seeing a positive shift in the loan mix, with attractively priced growth in our corporate asset-based lending and CRE portfolios. In total as of the were down think quarter due to a decrease in loans to mortgage companies as mortgage refis slowed from the rise in interest rates.
Pricing on new loans remained favorable as spreads were up 9 basis points linked quarter and a 29 basis points above a year ago. We will continue to improve our banks balance sheet composition as we focus on diversified, appropriately priced loan portfolio.
Even though the current environment is competitive, we plan to stay disciplined with our loan pricing structure while continuing to build market share. We're focused on winning good, relationship-oriented customers, which should help us generate better revenues and fee income.
Our Capital Markets business continues to be a strong contributor fee income. As expected, average daily revenues were in the range of our normalized levels at $1.3 million in the first water. Capital Markets return on assets was approximately 3% and we expect it to remain a high-return business for us. Losses on our Non-Strategic segment, reflecting lower credit costs and a decline in mortgage repurchase expense.
We signed agreements to sell our First Horizon Insurance and Capital businesses in the first quarter, reflecting our continued emphasis on improving profitability and returns.
We also made progress in improving productivity and efficiency, with consolidated expenses dropping year-over-year and linked quarter. There's clearly more work to be done, but we are well on our way toward implementing initiatives that should save us more than $100 million annually by 2012.
Approximately 40% to 50% of the targeted savings are currently in our run rate, as BJ will discuss in more detail. We are committed to rightsizing our expense rate with the same vigor that we address our capital position and our proactive stands on credit quality.
Credit quality notably improved in the first quarter with total provision cost of only $1 million. Improvement was broad-based across our portfolios. We're experiencing more upgrades and fewer downgrades. And our income CRE portfolio, we're seeing stabilizing profit values, as well as guarantors and sponsors stepping out. Our C&I and consumer portfolios benefited from an improving economic environment. Enhanced efforts in technological upgrades in our collections process helped mitigate losses in our consumer portfolio. As a result, over all net loan charge offs in non-performers were down in the first quarter to the lowest levels in 3 years.
Our capital position remains strong. During the first quarter, we repurchased a warrant issued to the treasury in 2008. We also declared a $0.01 per share quarterly cash dividend. We will continue to manage our capital smartly, balancing needs and opportunities as we strive to enhance our shareholders long-term returns.
To sum up, first quarter results were on track with our expectations. We are successfully executing our strategic priorities, and are committed to continued successful execution in what is likely to be a slow growth, low interest rate economic environment this year. 
I'll be back for some closing comments, and BJ will now take you through the detailed financial results for the quarter. BJ?"

As Bryan mentioned, net income available to common shareholders was $40 million compared with a loss of $49 million in 4Q '10. Included in first quarter's numbers were consolidated pretax income of $54 million and core business pretax income of $78 million. We also had some significant items, which you can see at the bottom of this slide this quarter, which I'll discuss in a few minutes during our segment highlights. 
If you turn to Slide 6, this shows our consolidated financial results. Again, diluted EPS was $0.15 per share, up from fourth quarter's loss of $0.20 a share. If you look at our net interest income, it was down primarily due to shorter day count, as well as loans to mortgage companies. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains climbed a bit from 4Q to 1Q. You can see noninterest expense was down quite a bit from 4Q to 1Q provision. We brought to $1 million provision this quarter to drive our pretax income results of $54 million. You'll see in discontinued operations the impact of our first drive in insurance sales. And down the bottom right of the page, you will see our diluted share count, moving up from 4Q '10 and 1Q '11, which reflects the full quarter impact of our December common equity raise.
Flip to Slide 7, I'll go through some segment highlights. Pretax income in the Regional Bank increased 4% linked quarter. Provision expense in the bank declined from $2 million to a provision credit of $12 million. NII decreased 7% from lower loan balances in mortgage warehouse lending, which offset modest growth in other commercial loan categories, as well as the shorted day count. Year-over-year, NII was up 1% in the regional bank. The increase was driven by higher loan fees, few interest results and favorable pricing on new loans. Total revenue decreased 7% linked quarter but was only down 1% from a year ago despite regulatory change impact on NSF and overdraft fees. Capital Markets pretax income declined $1.5 million or 6% linked quarter. Revenues were down 5%, and lower variable compensation drove expenses down 4%. Fixed income average daily revenue declined slightly from $1.3 million from $1.4 million.
Corporate segment had a loss of $8 million compared to fourth quarter's pretax income of $5 million. Gross quarter included a $5.8 million gain from the reduction of $100 million of TruPS at an 8 07 rate.
Fourth quarter included a $14.8 million gain from the sale of our Visa shares. Corporate expenses increased $2 million to $21 million. First quarter included a $3.3 million reversal of these to contingent liability compared to $8 million in the fourth quarter. Pretax loss in the Non-Strategic segment narrowed to $24 million from $77 million linked quarter. Loss provision decreased 69% linked quarter, primarily from improved metrics in the consumer portfolio. Servicing fees were up modestly, and mortgage hedging results increased to $12.5 million from $7.2 million in the fourth quarter. Mortgage repurchase expense was also lower, which I'll go into more detail about in a few slides.
That's the recent regulatory commentary regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosures and the actions outside against our subservicer, we currently believe there is little basis for liability on our part. And in the event we have some exposure, we believe that would be limited.
Moving on to Slide 8. Consolidated net interest margin was at 3.22%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Core business NIM was 3.58%, up 2 basis points from fourth to first. NIM was positively impacted by continued business mix shift, better loan pricing, lower deposit costs and the reduction in excess balances at the Fed. Linked quarter total average assets decreased to $24.6 billion from lower Fed and loan balances. Our averaged Fed balances declined by about $700 million quarter-over-quarter. The Non-Strategic portfolio continued its run off at about 5%. We also had a reduction in loans to mortgage companies, as I've mentioned, as the shorter duration loans were paid off as industry refi activity slowed considerably. 
From fourth to first quarter, average total commercial loans decreased 6%, including a $519 million drop from those close to mortgage companies. Excluding these mortgage warehouse loans, commercial loans actually increased 1%. We saw loan growth in our Corporate, CRE, ABL and business banking loan portfolios. While the decline in higher yield mortgage warehouse loans contributed to the decline in loan yields, yields on new loan products improved particularly in CRE, where they were up 18 basis points from last quarter. As anticipated, core deposits were down slightly linked quarter due to roll off of higher cost deposits associated with our exit from the TAG program. Weighted average cost of total deposits declined again, 3 basis points to 67 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 9. Consolidated expenses declined 4% from the fourth quarter and were down 7% from a year ago. As Bryan mentioned, we started to see results from productivity and efficiency efforts in the first quarter. Compensation decreased 5% linked quarter despite seasonally higher employee-related expenses and declined 11% year-over-year. Areas we've identified as efficiency opportunities, which you can see, include business process simplification, streamlining IT functions and reducing our procurement expenses. Recent examples of how we've achieved about $50 million in cost savings included closures and consolidations of five financial centers and FTU reduction of 5% from last quarter and numerous others initiatives across the country. As Bryan said, we are committed to improving our operating efficiency and delivering $100 million to $125 million in annual cost savings by 2012.
Moving on to Slide 10, I'll discuss mortgage repurchase trends. You'll see that our pipeline actually decreased $5 million to $529 million. Mortgage repurchase provision expense declined 16% to $37 million. This was the third consecutive quarter that our repurchase expense declined. The provision balance against net realized losses was $37 million so that the reserves stayed flat at 183. Recission rates have actually improved from 40% to 50% to now 45% to 55% range, and severity remained steady at 50% to 60%. New requests were down 16% linked quarter, and resolutions were modestly higher than new requests. Over 90% of our repurchase makeover requests are from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while the majority of the request was from pipeline are still from the '06 and '07 vintages, we are seeing a continued shift into the '08 vintage. As you know, we sold our mortgage platform in August of 2008. We did not have any repurchase or any new litigations related to our product securitizations in 1Q '11. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe that GSE mortgage request volume should declines over the next 12 months compared to 2010 levels.
Moving on to asset quality highlights on Slide 11. Bryan mentioned, our proactive approach to credit quality enabled us to reduce provision to $1 million this quarter. Linked quarter, charge offs declined 23% to $77 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $589 million. We saw improved credit trends from lower delinquencies in the consumer portfolio and profitable growth migration across the commercial loan portfolios.
Moving to Slide 12. NPAs declined 10% linked quarter, and inflows were down 21%. Our ORE balances decreased 15%. While we could experience quarter-to-quarter volatility, we anticipate 2011 NPA levels to decline compared to last year. And as we sit here today, we believe the next several quarters provision levels are likely to be below what we consider normalized levels of our bonefish target. However, we are mindful that national and global economic event and subsequent changes in our portfolios could impact this outlook.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12. First quarter marked another step towards achieving our long-term bonefish targets. We still have plenty of work to do, getting there with the right mix of revenue, expense and credit levels and profitability equation. But our core businesses are away with in 126 basis points in 1Q '11 compared to a long-term bonefish targets of 125 basis points to 145 basis points. And our consolidated ROA was 71 basis points. We're making continued progress towards higher returns by continuing to optimize our business mix, improving productivity and efficiency, favorably positioning our balance sheet and decreasing our credit cost. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bryan for some closing comments."

But what we're seeing day in, day out, customer business, the pricing continues to remain strong. As we pointed out, we're seeing improved spreads. We're seeing improved business mix on our balance sheet. Our pipelines continue to look very strong.

I'm pleased with the progress we've made. Our core business has showed solid performance. We made good headway in our efficiency initiatives. Credit quality improved notably, and we maintained our strong capital position. In other words, we're executing on our key priorities for 2011, and are getting back to blocking and tackling.
As first quarter results show, we are gradually optimizing our business mix, taking steps to build our higher-return Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses, while continuing to wind down the lower margin in non-Strategic segment. The Regional Bank's pretax income rose 4% linked quarter and moved from a pretax loss to a pretax profit year-over-year. Capital markets' performance remains solid. The non-Strategic segment continued to be less of a drag on our overall results.
Our proactive steps to identify and provide for problem credits are paying off, as we were able to sharply reduce the loan loss provision as credit trends improved. In fact, the Regional Bank booked a provision credit in the first quarter. At quarter's end, we maintained a reserve of 3.7% of total loans.
Revenue trends in the Regional Bank were also encouraging despite ongoing environmental challenges. Linked-quarter revenues declined from unfavorable seasonal impacts from lower NSF fees, a shorter date count and a lower level of earning assets. Our bankers' intensified calling efforts, along with emphasis on customer service, are helping us deepen and expand profitable customer relationships.
The Regional Bank's loan activity has been good. As a result, we're seeing a positive shift in the loan mix, with attractively priced growth in our corporate asset-based lending and CRE portfolios. Total loans though were down linked quarter due to a decrease in loans to mortgage companies as mortgage refis slowed from the rise in interest rates.
Pricing on new loans remained favorable as spreads were up 9 basis points linked quarter and at 29 basis points above a year ago. We will continue to improve our bank's balance sheet composition as we focus on a diversified, appropriately-priced Loan portfolio.
Even though the current environment is competitive, we plan to stay disciplined with our loan pricing structure while continuing to build market share. We're focused on winning good, relationship-oriented customers, which should help us generate better revenues and fee income.
Our Capital Markets business continues to be a strong contributor to fee income. As expected, average daily revenues were in the range of our normalized levels at $1.3 million in the first quarter. The Capital Markets' return on asset was approximately 3%, and we expect it to remain a high-return business for us. Losses on our non-Strategic segment narrowed, reflecting lower credit costs and a decline in mortgage repurchase expense.
We signed agreements to sell our First Horizon Insurance and Highland Capital businesses in the first quarter, reflecting our continued emphasis on improving profitability and returns.
We also made progress in improving productivity and efficiency, with consolidated expenses dropping year-over-year and linked quarter. There is clearly more work to be done, but we're well on our way toward implementing initiatives that should save us more than $100 million annually by 2012.
Approximately 40% to 50% of the targeted savings are currently in our run rate, as BJ will discuss in more detail. We are committed to rightsizing our expense base with the same vigor that we addressed our capital position and our proactive stands on credit quality.
Credit quality notably improved in the first quarter, with total provision cost of only $1 million. Improvement was broad-based across our portfolios. We're experiencing more upgrades and fewer downgrades. In our income CRE portfolio, we're seeing stabilizing property values, as well as guarantors and sponsors stepping up. 
Our C&I and Consumer portfolios benefited from an improving economic environment. Enhanced efforts in technological upgrades in our collections process helped mitigate losses in our Consumer portfolio. As a result, overall net loan charge offs and non-performers were down in the first quarter to the lowest levels in 3 years.
Our capital position remains strong. During the first quarter, we repurchased a warrant issued to the treasury in 2008. We also declared a $0.01 per share quarterly cash dividend. We will continue to manage our capital smartly, balancing needs and opportunities as we strive to enhance our shareholders' long-term returns.
To sum up, first quarter results were on track with our expectations. We are successfully executing our strategic priorities and are committed to continued successful execution in what is likely to be a slow growth, low interest rate economic environment this year. 
I'll be back for some closing comments, and BJ will now take you through the detailed financial results for the quarter. BJ?"

As Bryan mentioned, net income available to common shareholders was $40 million compared with a loss of $49 million in 4Q '10. Included in first quarter's numbers were consolidated pretax income of $54 million and core business pretax income of $78 million. We also had some significant items, which you can see at the bottom of the slide this quarter, which I'll discuss in a few minutes during our segment highlights. 
If you turn to Slide 6, this shows our consolidated financial results. Again, diluted EPS was $0.15 a share, up from fourth quarter's loss of $0.20 a share. If you look at our net interest income, it was down primarily due to shorter day count, as well as loans to mortgage companies. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, climbed a bit from 4Q to 1Q. You can see noninterest expense was down quite a bit from 4Q to 1Q provision. 
We booked a $1 million provision this quarter to drive our pretax income results of $54 million. You will see in discontinued operations the impact of our First Horizon insurance sale. And down the bottom right of the page, you will see our diluted share count, moving up from 4Q '10 to 1Q '11, which reflects the full quarter impact of our December common equity raise.
Flip to Slide 7, I'll go through some segment highlights. Pretax income in the Regional Bank increased 4% linked quarter. Provision expense in the bank declined from $2 million to a provision credit of $12 million. NII decreased 7% from lower loan balances in mortgage warehouse lending, which offset modest growth in other commercial loan categories, as well as the shorter day count. 
Year-over-year, NII was up 1% in the Regional Bank. The increase was driven by higher loan fees, fewer interest reversals and favorable pricing on new loans. Total revenue decreased 7% linked quarter but was only down 1% from a year ago despite regulatory change impacts on NSF and overdraft fees. Capital Markets' pretax income declined $1.5 million or 6% linked quarter. Revenues were down 5%, and lower variable compensation drove expenses down 4%. Fixed income average daily revenue declined slightly from $1.3 million -- from $1.4 million.
Corporate segment had a loss of $8 million compared to fourth quarter's pretax income of $5 million. First quarter included a $5.8 million gain from the redemption of $100 million of TruPS at an 8.07% rate. Fourth quarter included a $14.8 million gain from sale of our Visa shares. 
Corporate expenses increased $2 million to $21 million. First quarter included a $3.3 million reversal of Visa contingent liability compared to $8 million in the fourth quarter. Pretax loss in the non-Strategic segment narrowed to $24 million from $77 million linked quarter. Loan loss provision decreased 69% linked quarter, primarily from improved metrics in the Consumer portfolio. 
Servicing fees were up modestly, and mortgage hedging results increased to $12.5 million from $7.2 million in the fourth quarter. Mortgage repurchase expense was also lower, which I'll go into more detail about in a few slides.
As a recent regulatory commentary regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosures and the actions outlined against our sub-servicer, we currently believe there is little basis for liability on our part. And in the event we have any exposure, we believe it would be limited.
Moving on to Slide 8, consolidated net interest margin was at 3.22%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Core business NIM was 3.58%, up 2 basis points from fourth to first. NIM was positively impacted by continued business mix shift, better loan pricing, lower deposit costs and a reduction in excess balances at the Fed. 
Linked-quarter total average assets decreased to $24.6 billion from lower Fed and loan balances. Our average Fed balances declined by about $700 million quarter-to-quarter. The non-Strategic portfolio continued its run off at about 5%. We also had a reduction in loans to mortgage companies, as I mentioned, as the shorter duration loans were paid off as industry refi activities slowed considerably. 
From fourth to first quarter, average total commercial loans decreased 6%, including a $519 million drop from those loans to mortgage companies. Excluding these mortgage warehouse loans, commercial loans actually increased 1%. We saw loan growth in our Corporate, CRE, ABL and Business Banking Loan portfolios. While the decline in higher-yield mortgage warehouse loans contributed to the decline in loan yields, yields on new loan products improved particularly in CRE, where they were up 18 basis points from last quarter. 
As anticipated, core deposits were down slightly linked quarter due to roll off of higher-cost deposits associated with our exit from the tag programs. Weighted average cost of total deposits declined again, 3 basis points to 67 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 9, consolidated expenses declined 4% from the fourth quarter and were down 7% from a year ago. As Bryan mentioned, we started to see results from productivity and efficiency efforts in the first quarter. Compensation decreased 5% linked quarter despite seasonally higher employee-related expenses and declined 11% year-over-year. 
Areas we've identified as efficiency opportunities, which you can see, included business process simplification, streamlining IT functions and reducing our procurement expenses. Recent examples of how we've achieved about $50 million in cost savings include closures and consolidations of 5 financial centers and FTU reduction of 5% from last quarter and numerous others initiatives across the company. As Bryan said, we are committed to improving our operating efficiency and delivering $100 million to $125 million in annual cost savings by 2012.
Moving on to Slide 10, I'll discuss mortgage repurchase trends. You'll see that our pipeline actually decreased $5 million to $529 million. Mortgage repurchase provision expense declined 16% to $37 million. This was the third consecutive quarter that our repurchase expense declined. The provision balanced against net realized losses of $37 million so that the reserves stayed flat at $183 million. 
Rescission rates have actually improved from 40% to 50% to now 45% to 55% range, and severity remained steady at 50% to 60%. New requests were down 16% linked quarter, and resolutions were modestly higher than new requests. Over 90% of our repurchase makeover requests are from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while the majority of requests in the pipeline are still from the '06 and '07 vintages, we are seeing a continued shift into the '08 vintage. 
As you know, we sold our mortgage platform in August of 2008. We did not have any repurchase request or any new litigation related to our product securitizations in 1Q '11. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe that GSE mortgage request volume should decline over the next 12 months compared to 2010's levels.
Moving on to asset quality highlights on Slide 11, Bryan mentioned, our proactive approach to credit quality enabled us to reduce the provision to $1 million this quarter. Linked quarter, charge offs declined 23% to $77 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $589 million. We saw improved credit trends from lower delinquencies in the Consumer portfolio and favorable grade migration across the Commercial Loan portfolios.
Moving to Slide 12, NPAs declined 2% linked quarter, and inflows were down 21%. Our ORE balances decreased 15%. While we could experience quarter-to-quarter volatility, we anticipate 2011 NPA levels to decline compared to last year. And as we sit here today, we believe the next several quarters provision levels are likely to be below what we consider normalized levels of our bonefish target. However, we are mindful that national and global economic events and subsequent changes in our portfolios could impact this outlook.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12. First quarter marked another step towards achieving our long-term bonefish targets. We still have plenty of work to do, getting there with the right mix of revenue, expense and credit levels in the profitability equation. But our core businesses ROA was at 126 basis points in 1Q '11 compared to our long-term bonefish targets of 125 basis points to 145 basis points. And our consolidated ROA was 71 basis points. We're making continued progress towards higher returns by continuing to optimize our business mix, improving productivity and efficiency, favorably positioning our balance sheet and decreasing our credit costs.
Now I'll turn it back over to Bryan for some closing comments."

So there's always a little bit of volatility. And in our quarter, as with BJ and I both pointed out, we had some contraction in the mortgage warehouse lending, which tended to be tied more to what's going on in interest rates in the refi market. But what we're seeing day in, day out, Customer business, the pricing continues to remain strong. As we pointed out, we're seeing improved spreads. We're seeing improved business mix on our balance sheet. Our pipelines continued to look very strong. In fact, our pipeline for new loan production at the end of the first quarter was up slightly from where it was at the end of the fourth quarter. And so, we're reasonably encouraged with the opportunity for continued customer growth, continued customer activity, and as we both have said, a slower growth environment and a low interest rate environment.

We are moving towards getting that $100 million to $125 million, executed and in our run rate by the end of this year so that we have a clear glide path into 2012.

We think that's going to be reasonably stable. It's going to ebb and flow just a little here and there. As you correctly pointed out, the core bank balance sheet is somewhat smaller when you extract the impact this National Strategic portfolios. But I think it's important to note that those aren't going to 0 over a very short period of time. There's components of it. There are going to be larger, longer amortization. The Home Equity portfolio is a portion that's running off most rapidly. It's probably running off today in the 15% to 20% CPR range. And so, the opportunity for us is, as the economy picks up, we'll continue to offset that contraction with growth in the core banking and other opportunity. So, as we look at it, we think the balance sheet will remain reasonably stable. Capital and share count is a different question. That really goes back to my earlier comments, which are -- we're going to look at how we smartly manage that capital. It will involve our capital planning process. It's going to involve stress testing the balance sheet, and it's going to involve communicating with our regulators and it's going to take some time. But we're mindful of that. And to the early question, I don't think we need to warehouse the capital. We'll manage it at appropriate times, in the appropriate ways, and we'll be as proactive as we can in doing that."

I'm pleased with the progress we've made. Our core business has showed solid performance. We made good headway in our efficiency initiatives, credit quality improved notably and we maintained our strong capital position. In other words, we're executing on our key priorities for 2011, and are getting back to blocking and tackling.
As first quarter results show, we are gradually optimizing our business mix, taking steps to build our higher-return Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses, while continuing to wind down the lower margin in non-Strategic segment. The Regional Bank's pretax income rose 4% linked quarter and moved from a pretax loss to a pretax profit year-over-year. Capital markets' performance remains solid. The non-Strategic segment continued to be less of a drag on our overall results.
Our proactive steps to identify and provide for problem credits are paying off, as we were able to sharply reduce the loan loss provision as credit trends improved. In fact, the Regional Bank booked a provision credit in the first quarter. At quarter's end, we maintained a reserve of 3.7% of total loans.
Revenue trends in the Regional Bank were also encouraging despite ongoing environmental challenges. Linked-quarter revenues declined from unfavorable seasonal impacts from lower NSF fees, a shorter day count and a lower level of earning assets. Our bankers' intensified calling efforts, along with emphasis on customer service, are helping us deepen and expand profitable customer relationships.
The Regional Bank's loan activity has been good. As a result, we're seeing a positive shift in the loan mix, with attractively priced growth in our corporate asset-based lending and CRE portfolios. Total loans though were down linked quarter due to a decrease in loans to mortgage companies as mortgage refis slowed from the rise in interest rates.
Pricing on new loans remained favorable as spreads were up 9 basis points linked quarter and at 29 basis points above a year ago. We will continue to improve our bank's balance sheet composition as we focus on a diversified, appropriately-priced Loan portfolio.
Even though the current environment is competitive, we plan to stay disciplined with our loan pricing structure while continuing to build market share. We're focused on winning good, relationship-oriented customers, which should help us generate better revenues and fee income.
Our Capital Markets business continues to be a strong contributor to fee income. As expected, average daily revenues were in the range of our normalized levels at $1.3 million in the first quarter. Capital Markets' return on asset was approximately 3%, and we expect it to remain a high-return business for us. Losses on our non-Strategic segment narrowed, reflecting lower credit costs and a decline in mortgage repurchase expense.
We signed agreements to sell our First Horizon Insurance and Highland Capital businesses in the first quarter, reflecting our continued emphasis on improving profitability and returns.
We also made progress in improving productivity and efficiency, with consolidated expenses dropping year-over-year and linked quarter. There is clearly more work to be done, but we're well on our way toward implementing initiatives that should save us more than $100 million annually by 2012.
Approximately 40% to 50% of the targeted savings are currently in our run rate, as BJ will discuss in more detail. We are committed to rightsizing our expense base with the same vigor that we addressed our capital position and our proactive stands on credit quality.
Credit quality notably improved in the first quarter, with total provision cost of only $1 million. Improvement was broad-based across our portfolios. We're experiencing more upgrades and fewer downgrades. In our income CRE portfolio, we're seeing stabilizing property values, as well as guarantors and sponsors stepping up. 
Our C&I Consumer portfolios benefited from an improving economic environment. Enhanced efforts in technological upgrades in our collections process helped mitigate losses in our Consumer portfolio. As a result, overall net loan charge offs and non-performers were down in the first quarter to the lowest levels in 3 years.
Our capital position remains strong. During the first quarter, we repurchased a warrant issued to the treasury in 2008. We also declared a $0.01 per share quarterly cash dividend. We will continue to manage our capital smartly, balancing needs and opportunities, as we strive to enhance our shareholders' long-term returns.
To sum up, first quarter results were on track with our expectations. We are successfully executing our strategic priorities and are committed to continued successful execution in what is likely to be a slow growth, low interest rate economic environment this year. 
I'll be back for some closing comments, and BJ will now take you through the detailed financial results for the quarter. BJ?"

As Bryan mentioned, net income available to common shareholders was $40 million compared with a loss of $49 million in 4Q '10. Included in first quarter's numbers were consolidated pretax income of $54 million and core business pretax income of $78 million. We also had some significant items, which you can see at the bottom of the slide, this quarter, which I'll discuss in a few minutes during our segment highlights. 
If you turn to Slide 6, this shows our consolidated financial results. Again, diluted EPS was $0.15 a share, up from fourth quarter's loss of $0.20 a share. If you look at our net interest income, it was down primarily due to shorter day count, as well as loans to mortgage companies. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, climbed a bit from 4Q to 1Q. You can see noninterest expense was down quite a bit from 4Q to 1Q. 
Provision. We booked a $1 million provision this quarter to drive our pretax income results of $54 million. You will see in discontinued operations the impact of our First Horizon insurance sale. And down the bottom right of the page, you will see our diluted share count, moving up from 4Q '10 to 1Q '11, which reflects the full quarter impact of our December common equity raise.
Flip to Slide 7, I'll go through some segment highlights. Pretax income in the Regional Bank increased 4% linked quarter. Provision expense in the bank declined from $2 million to a provision credit of $12 million. NII decreased 7% from lower loan balances in mortgage warehouse lending, which offset modest growth in other commercial loan categories, as well as the shorter day count. 
Year-over-year, NII was up 1% in the Regional Bank. The increase was driven by higher loan fees, fewer interest reversals and favorable pricing on new loans. Total revenue decreased 7% linked quarter but was only down 1% from a year ago despite regulatory change impacts on NSF and overdraft fees. Capital Markets' pretax income declined $1.5 million or 6% linked quarter. Revenues were down 5%, and lower variable compensation drove expenses down 4%. Fixed income average daily revenue declined slightly from $1.3 million -- from $1.4 million.
Corporate segment had a loss of $8 million compared to fourth quarter's pretax income of $5 million. First quarter included a $5.8 million gain from the redemption of $100 million of TruPS at an 8.07% rate. Fourth quarter included a $14.8 million gain from sale of our Visa shares. 
Corporate expenses increased $2 million to $21 million. First quarter included a $3.3 million reversal of Visa contingent liability compared to $8 million in the fourth quarter. Pretax loss in the non-Strategic segment narrowed to $24 million from $77 million linked quarter. Loan loss provision decreased 69% linked quarter, primarily from improved metrics in the Consumer portfolio. 
Servicing fees were up modestly, and mortgage hedging results increased to $12.5 million from $7.2 million in the fourth quarter. Mortgage repurchase expense was also lower, which I'll go into more detail about in a few slides.
As for recent regulatory commentary regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosures and the actions outlined against our sub-servicer, we currently believe there is little basis for liability on our part. And in the event we have any exposure, we believe it would be limited.
Moving on to Slide 8, consolidated net interest margin was at 3.22%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Core business NIM was 3.58%, up 2 basis points from fourth to first. NIM was positively impacted by continued business mix shift, better loan pricing, lower deposit costs and a reduction in excess balances at the Fed. 
Linked-quarter total average assets decreased to $24.6 billion from lower Fed and loan balances. Our average Fed balances declined by about $700 million quarter-to-quarter. The non-Strategic portfolio continued its run off at about 5%. We also had a reduction in loans to mortgage companies, as I mentioned, as the shorter duration loans were paid off as industry refi activities slowed considerably. 
From fourth to first quarter, average total commercial loans decreased 6%, including a $519 million drop from those loans to mortgage companies. Excluding these mortgage warehouse loans, commercial loans actually increased 1%. We saw loan growth in our Corporate, CRE, ABL and Business Banking Loan portfolios. While the decline in higher-yield mortgage warehouse loans contributed to the decline in loan yields, yields on new loan products improved particularly in CRE, where they were up 18 basis points from last quarter. 
As anticipated, core deposits were down slightly linked quarter due to roll off of higher-cost deposits associated with our exit from the tag programs. Weighted average cost of total deposits declined again, 3 basis points to 67 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 9, consolidated expenses declined 4% from the fourth quarter and were down 7% from a year ago. As Bryan mentioned, we started to see results from productivity and efficiency efforts in the first quarter. Compensation decreased 5% linked quarter despite seasonally higher employee-related expenses and declined 11% year-over-year. 
Areas we've identified as efficiency opportunities, which you can see, include business process simplification, streamlining IT functions and reducing our procurement expenses. Recent examples of how we've achieved about $50 million in cost savings include closures and consolidations of 5 financial centers and FTU reduction of 5% from last quarter and numerous others initiatives across the company. As Bryan said, we are committed to improving our operating efficiency and delivering $100 million to $125 million in annual cost savings by 2012.
Moving on to Slide 10, I'll discuss mortgage repurchase trends. You'll see that our pipeline actually decreased $5 million to $529 million. Mortgage repurchase provision expense declined 16% to $37 million. This was the third consecutive quarter that our repurchase expense declined. The provision balanced against net realized losses of $37 million so that the reserves stayed flat at $183 million. 
Rescission rates have actually improved from 40% to 50% to now 45% to 55% range, and severity remained steady at 50% to 60%. New requests were down 16% linked quarter, and resolutions were modestly higher than new requests. Over 90% of our repurchase makeover requests are from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while the majority of requests in the pipeline are still from the '06 and '07 vintages, we are seeing a continued shift into the '08 vintage. 
As you know, we sold our mortgage platform in August of 2008. We did not have any repurchase request or any new litigation related to our product securitizations in 1Q '11. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe that GSE mortgage request volume should decline over the next 12 months compared to 2010's levels.
Moving on to asset quality highlights on Slide 11, as Bryan mentioned, our proactive approach to credit quality enabled us to reduce provision to $1 million this quarter. Linked quarter, charge offs declined 23% to $77 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $589 million. We saw improved credit trends from lower delinquencies in the Consumer portfolio and favorable grade migration across the Commercial Loan portfolios.
Moving to Slide 12, NPAs declined 2% linked quarter and inflows were down 21%. Our ORE balances decreased 15%. While we could experience quarter-to-quarter volatility, we anticipate 2011 NPA levels to decline compared to last year. And as we sit here today, we believe the next several quarters' provision levels are likely to be below what we consider normalized levels of our bonefish targets. However, we are mindful that national and global economic events and subsequent changes in our portfolios could impact this outlook.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12. First quarter marked another step towards achieving our long-term bonefish targets. We still have plenty of work to do, getting there with the right mix of revenue, expense and credit levels in the profitability equation. But our core businesses ROA was at 126 basis points in 1Q '11 compared to our long-term bonefish targets of 125 basis points to 145 basis points. And our consolidated ROA was 71 basis points. We're making continued progress towards higher returns by continuing to optimize our business mix, improving productivity and efficiency, favorably positioning our balance sheet and decreasing our credit costs.
Now I'll turn it back over to Bryan for some closing comments."

So there's always a little bit of volatility.

But what we're seeing day in, day out, Customer business, the pricing continues to remain strong. As we pointed out, we're seeing improved spreads. We're seeing improved business mix on our balance sheet. Our pipelines continue to look very strong. In fact, our pipeline for new loan production at the end of the first quarter was up slightly from where it was at the end of the fourth quarter.

But you're right, that's getting close to the bottom. We're optimizing the balance sheet, as you can see, in terms of taking down excess balances at the Fed. We are taking advantages when we see them to put on assets in the Securities portfolio at reasonable yields with reasonable structures. But I would, overall, say that our NIM should be relatively flat to maybe modestly up over the next few quarters."

As you correctly point out, the core bank balance sheet is somewhat smaller when you extract the impact these National Strategic portfolios. But I think it's important to note that those aren't going to 0 over a very short period of time. There's components of it that are going to be larger, longer amortization. The Home Equity portfolio is a portion that's running off most rapidly. It's probably running off today in the 15% to 20% CPR range. And so, the opportunity for us is, as the economy picks up, we'll continue to offset that contraction with growth in the core banking and other opportunities. So, as we look at it, we think the balance sheet will remain reasonably stable. Capital and share count is a different question. That really goes back to my earlier comments, which are -- we're going to look at how we smartly manage that capital. It will involve our capital planning process. It's going to involve stress testing the balance sheet, and it's going to involve communicating with our regulators and it's going to take some time. But we're mindful of that. And to the earlier question, I don't think we need to warehouse the capital. We'll manage it at the appropriate times, in the appropriate ways, and we'll be as proactive as we can in doing that."

During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities. We made headway in optimizing our business mix for profitability and returns, as of the Regional Banks pretax income increased 13% linked quarter, and the Non-Strategic segments drag decreased. We improved productivity and efficiency with overall expenses down 2% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Net income rose 6% to $43 million.
We are controlling what we can control in our company and making progress on our strategic priorities. Our bankers are focusing on profitably increasing market share with superior customer service. We have made more than 14,000 customer calls year-to-date, resulting in 3% period end loan growth in the Regional Bank.
In our C&I portfolio, growth was encouraging as period end loans were up 5%. The increase was driven by loans to mortgage companies and our corporate borrowers. Commercial loans, excluding loans to mortgage companies, were up 1%. We are positioning our balance sheet for higher returns by replacing low yielding non-strategic loans with better-priced, more profitable relationship-oriented loans. Our success in expanding and deepening customer relationships benefited revenues in the bank, as net interest income was up 1% and fees increased 2% from last quarter.
Capital Markets continues to be a strong contributor to our overall fee income. Capital Markets average daily revenue of $1.1 million, down from last quarter's $1.3 million but within our normalized range of expected revenues.
We made additional progress towards achieving our productivity and efficiency targets, having identified $110 million in annual cost savings. This $110 million of annualized savings is in our expense based run rate, and we have identified our execution another $60 million to be mostly completed by the end of 2011. BJ will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we took actions to streamline our company as we reorganized our structure, simplified our lines of business and made investments in technology. These actions should result in overcoming more flexible and nimble to serve our customers better.
Our strategic expenses declined 15% linked quarter due to a 34% reduction in mortgage repurchase provision expense. Our goal is to achieve a full year 2013 consolidated expense base that is 20% to 25% less than full year 2010 consolidated expenses of $1.3 billion. Achieving our goal should enable us to reach a 60% to 65% efficiency ratio sometime in 2013. Our efficiency goal also assumes ongoing investments in people, products and technology. From 2009 to the end of this year, we will invest in more than $100 million in system upgrades and technology.
Credit quality trends also improved as nonperformers and net charge-offs declined. Provision expense was unchanged at $1 million in the second quarter. We're seeing continued stabilization in our commercial loan portfolio. Additionally, enhanced collection efforts have helped lower delinquencies in our consumer portfolio.
All in all, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in successfully executing on our strategic priorities. BJ will now take you through the second quarter financial results, and I'll be back with some closing comments before we take your questions. BJ?"

Good morning, everbody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Significa",1436,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everbody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Significant items totaled $16.6 million and were related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives. Major items include $7.5 million of expense from employee severance costs in that number and a $9 million charge to terminate a technology services contract, which will create efficiencies going forward.
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of First Horizon Insurance, and we recognized a $4.2 million after-tax gain, which you can see in discontinued operations. Revenues were down primarily due to lower fixed income and capital markets, offsetting bank NII and fee increases, as well as higher mortgage hedging results.
Expenses were down despite $15 million of restructuring-related charges. Due to a combination of our efficiency efforts, mortgage repurchase expense declined and lower variable compensation in capital markets.
Turning to Slide 7, look at some segment highlights. In the regional bank, pretax income was $73 million, up 13% linked quarter. Revenues in the bank increased 2%. Expenses were down 3%, and we booked a provision credit in the bank of $13.7 million compared to $12.4 million last quarter. Capital Markets pretax income declined to $17 million from $22 million linked quarter as revenues decreased 13%. Lower variable comp growth expenses down 9%. Fixed income average daily revenue has declined to $1.1 million from $1.3 million as market conditions continue to result in cautious buying activity.
In our Corporate segment, we had a pretax loss of $27 million compared to loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Second quarter in the Corporate segment is where we include a $16.6 million of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency charges, as well as a $3.4 million interest related to tax refund, which is booked in other income. Remember that the first quarter included $3.1 million of restructuring charges, a $5.8 million gain from the redemption of our TRUPs and a $3.3 million reversal of our Visa contingent liability.
In the Non-Strategic segment, the pretax loss narrowed to $11 million in the second quarter. Net hedging results were $15.4 million this quarter compared to $12.5 million in the first. Non-Strategic expenses decreased as mortgage repurchase provision expense declined, and I'll go into that a little more detail in a few slides.
Going on Durban, we expect that the impact of the final decision should be about a $15 million to $20 million annual hit to our revenue. However, we believe that the impact should substantially be mitigated by the implementation of new sources of revenue. So, for example, we're charging noncustomers to use our delivery systems or increasing existing transaction and product fees, reducing fee waivers, and we're modifying our checking product suite.
Turning to NIM and balance sheet on Slide 8. The consolidated NIM were relatively stable at 3.20% compared to 3.22% in the first. And core business NIM was 3.57%. And we expect the NIM to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Linked quarter, total asses remained stable as well at approximately $25 billion. The Regional Banks period end loans, as Bryan talked about, were up 3%. And the Non-Strategic loans declined 5%, resulting in modest net growth in total loans.
New commercial loan spreads were 365 basis points, up 19 basis points from last year, and were flat linked quarter. As we've emphasized, we are replacing lower quality, lower yield loans with higher quality, higher spread loans across the bank. In fact, the net growth we saw on the bank versus the runoff in the Non-Strategic should generate 2x the NII annually.
On Slide 9, let's talk a little bit about the successful execution showing up in our loan pipeline trends. Bryan talked about our successful calling experts, and that execution is reflected in the year-over-year growth of our commercial loan pipeline and our close-end funded commercial loans. We are seeing demand in the C&I space, especially from our Corporate borrowers and asset-based lending borrowers. We've also seen some opportunity in new CRE customers. And our Regional Bank have increased by 67% since last year at higher spreads.
Overall, pricing spreads are favorable, but we do expect continued pricing pressure in the market.
Moving onto productivity and efficiency on Slide 10. The linked quarter consolidated expenses declined 2% to $309 million. As I mentioned earlier, that includes that $16.6 million of restructuring. Recent efficiency actions including streamlining for regional bank structure, reducing cost and procurement, reducing cost and technology, as well as numerous other back-office functions.
As Bryan talked about, we've now identified $110 million in annual cost saves, with an annualized $50 million executed already and in our 2Q '11 run rate. The remaining $60 million is expected to be largely executed by the end of '11, and we will continue to execute on getting our cost down to achieve our targeted efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 11, talk a little bit about mortgage repurchase. Linked quarter, our pipeline declined 15% to $451 million. And our repurchase provision expense declined 34% to $24.6 million, marking the fourth consecutive quarter decline. Net realized losses were relatively flat at $38.5 million, and we decreased reserves by $14 million from last quarter. Rescission rates improved but are still within our range of 45% to 55%, and severity remains steady at 50% to 60%. Linked quarter, you see that new requests were down 18%, and resolutions were up 10%. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe the GSE mortgage repurchase request volume should continue to decline. And again, we do not have any private securitization request to date.
Turning to Slide 12. Let me take a few minutes to discuss private securitizations, as they've recently become a hot topic again, in light of Bank of America's announced settlement. The comparisons to their settlement has been made regarding our securitizations. We believe there is significant differences that make those comparisons less relevant. Our view of our potential risk here has remained consistent over time. 
Looking at the bottom of the slide, there are a few data points, which may help you analyze this. We achieved about $33 billion of private securitizations between '04 and '07, of which, 40% was jumbo and 60% or so was Alt-A. And we did not have any subprime securitizations.
As I've said before, we have had no repurchase request from these securitizations to date, and have 3 previously disclosed losses, one of which has been withdrawn. Our securitizations have generally performed favorably overall to industry cohort benchmarks. Our reps and warranties on private securitizations are generally more limited than for GSEs. And so, we sit here, of course, we rekindle everything particularly since we have no private securitization requests. But sitting here today, considering the differences between the private securitization, the $33 billion originated between '04 and '07 and the $70 billion of GSE volume originated between '05 and '08, the more limited nature of the reps and warranties and the procedural differences of initiating repurchase range versus GSEs, the disclosures in the securitization prospectuses, the relative performance versus industry cohorts of our securitizations and the mix of our securitizations versus the industry, we believe it's unlikely that our private securitization risk is greater than our repurchase experience with the GSEs, which have been manageable as an earnings headwind.
You can see on Slide 13, our asset quality trends continue to improve. Loan loss provision was flat at $1 million. Linked quarter, net charge-offs declined 14% to $66 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $524 million. The reserve to loan ratio remained strong at 3 26 at the end of the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 14, nonperforming assets declined 9% linked quarter. Commercial end close decreased by 35%, and resolutions were up 40%. Loan inflows were driven by continued credit stabilization in our commercial portfolios.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. We're continuing to make progress towards reaching our long-term bonefish goals. Our core business are away within an annualized 1.06% in the quarter, and our core NIM was at 3.57%. We're taking steps towards achieving higher returns by controlling what we can control, continuing to better position our balance sheet by replacing lower yielding non-strategic loans with higher spread loans in the bank. We're improving productivity and efficiency, and we're decreasing our credit environmental cost. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan."

We have a strong core banking and Capital Markets businesses. We have strengthened these businesses by our team's efforts to win new clients and grow organically by our continued investments in systems and processes to help us provide unparalleled customer service, and by our steps to make us a significantly more efficient company.
We have a strong capital base, and we have made solid progress on credit quality and our pipeline of mortgage repurchase request.
Our bonefish tool is widely used in organization, and serves as a constant reminder that we are managing the company for profitability and strong returns to our shareholders.
Our top priority for the remainder of this year and next year is to continue to focus on improving profitability and the long-term earnings power of the core franchise. We are working on our blocking and tackling daily, actively calling on new and existing retail and commercial customers, improving spreads, managing our fee revenue and reducing our cost of doing business.
Our strong capital levels give us a significant level of stability. We are committed to investing that capital in a disciplined manner. Our principal goal is to increase value to our shareholders as we prudently evaluate our options, invest in organic growth, potentials mergers and acquisitions and/or increase dividend and stock buybacks, based on which option best meets our goal.
We believe that excess capital should be returned to our shareholders when it cannot be attractively invested in organic growth or well-priced deals. Expanding our business by investing capital in well-priced, value-creating mergers and acquisitions is still a priority, but it does not take precedence over our goal to increase value for our shareholders.
We look forward to executing on our strategic priorities and remain committed to producing consistently attractive returns for shareholders. Thank you, and now, we'll take your questions. Operator?"

We're working to control our cost, and we're going to be driven by how the bonefish drives our results. So we're going to look to book profitable loans.

So what we see within the book is continuing kind of improvement within credit grade categories. As it relates to opportunities we have we were probably a early adapter because we were not heavy in income CRE compared to some of our competitors. But what we see now, so we also have seen in the second quarter and really at the end of first quarter, is some permanent market activity as well. So where you are taken out of loans and as we're putting new loans on, there's kind of a trade going there. So we're seeing good activity, and I think the good thing, John, is it's good to see some permanent activity. So you actually see a role of the book, which is a positive thing as opposed to a stagnant book.

And we're already starting to see nice progress. So once we get past that, it really comes back to normalization. If you look at continued operations this quarter, about $0.15 worth of earnings, you can add back to unusual items of $0.02. And that gives us to about $0.17 number. And then, if you look at the Non-Strategic, so if I wipe out the loss that we have there, the $11 million loss, then you'd end up adding $0.03. However, we're not providing anything. So if you take the provision back to a normal level, you would take out $0.05. You don't do a lot of gymnastics to get down to kind of a run rate around $0.15 or $0.60 per year. Bryan, if we go back and we'll get to $60 million in incremental savings that we're now still working towards and we have in place by the end of the year, that would add another $0.15. So that gets us potentially up to $0.75. Within the critical thing in my mind is that we kind of have to look for a normalized number around the dollar, which should be kind of our long-term goal. And there are really 2 levers to get there, which would be full year efficiency or share repurchase. So untapping those 2 things becomes pretty critical. And so I was just wondering, if we add another $40 million in expense savings, we have to take the Regional Banking kind of efficiency ratio down towards 60, and then getting about $500 million worth of share repurchase, that would give us the 20% accretion that could get us to $1. So all that financial engineering to get back to really 2 questions, can we see an additional $40 million to $50 million in expense savings? And is $500 million kind of the right bogey to think about eventually to be able to get back to the share repurchase --"

We're working to get more efficient day in, day out. And as I said in the comments earlier on, we're targeting to see that 60% to 65% ratio sometime in 2013. That means we've got to get the efficiencies that we've talked about this morning and probably a little bit more. It means that we've got to get some of these environmental or credit cycle kinds of cost producing. It means we'll probably get a bit of continued help on the revenue side, but we think we can do that. And we think that the banking overhead efficiency ratio ought to be in the high 50s over time. But we've got to operate to and continue to do that, and we will. On the capital side, as I mentioned earlier, that's still going to evolve. But that's an area that we're focused on. We recognize that we have greater capital in the organization today than we believe we need to run at long-term. And we'll look for ways to be repatriate that to our shareholders either in dividend or stock buyback, if we can't put it to work attractively in organic growth or otherwise.

From the conversations we have with customers, it's still mixed. There's some customers who tends to be our larger customers that are becoming more confident. There seems to be some disparity of what segment of the economy is being served, what is the consumer segment or whether it tends to be more of a manufacturing base of the segments of the economy. But we're seeing a little bit better demand across the entire spectrum but particularly with our largest customer."

During the second quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities. We made headway in optimizing our business mix for profitability and returns, as the regional bank's pretax income increased 13% linked quarter, and the non-strategic segments drag decreased. We improved productivity and efficiency with overall expenses down 2% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Net income rose 6% to $43 million.
We are controlling what we can control in our company and making progress on our strategic priorities. Our bankers are focusing on profitably increasing market share with superior customer service. We have made more than 14,000 customer calls year-to-date, resulting in 3% period-end loan growth in the regional banking.
In our C&I portfolio, growth was encouraging as period-end loans were up 5%. The increase was driven by loans to mortgage companies and our corporate borrowers. Commercial loans, excluding loans to mortgage companies, were up 1%. We are positioning our balance sheet for higher returns by replacing low yielding non-strategic loans with better-priced, more profitable relationship-oriented loans. Our success in expanding and deepening customer relationships benefited revenues in the bank, as net interest income was up 1% and fees increased 2% from last quarter.
Capital markets continues to be a strong contributor to our overall fee income. Capital markets' average daily revenue was $1.1 million, down from last quarter's $1.3 million, but within our normalized range of expected revenues.
We made additional progress towards achieving our productivity and efficiency targets, having identified $110 million in annual cost savings. This $110 million of annualized savings is in our expense based run rate, and we have identified for execution another $60 million to be mostly completed by the end of 2011. BJ will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we took actions to streamline our company as we reorganized our structure, simplified our lines of business and made investments in technology. These actions should result in our becoming more flexible and nimble to serve our customers better.
Our strategic expenses declined 15% linked quarter due to a 34% reduction in mortgage repurchase provision expense. Our goal is to achieve a full year 2013 consolidated expense base that is 20% to 25% less than full year 2010 consolidated expenses of $1.3 billion. Achieving our goal should enable us to reach a 60% to 65% efficiency ratio sometime in 2013. Our efficiency goal also assumes ongoing investments in people, products and technology. From 2009 to the end of this year, we will invest in more than $100 million in system upgrades and technology.
Credit quality trends also improved as nonperformers and net charge-offs declined. Provision expense was unchanged at $1 million in the second quarter. We're seeing continued stabilization in our commercial loan portfolio. Additionally, enhanced collection efforts have helped lower delinquencies in our consumer portfolio.
All in all, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in successfully executing on our strategic priorities. BJ will now take you through the second quarter's financial results, and I'll be back with some closing comments before we take your questions. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Signific",1431,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Significant items totaled $16.6 million and were related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives. Major items include $7.5 million of expense from employee severance costs in that number and a $9 million charge to terminate a technology services contract, which will create efficiencies going forward.
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of First Horizon Insurance, and we recognized a $4.2 million after-tax gain, which you can see in discontinued operations. Revenues were down primarily due to lower fixed income in capital markets, offsetting bank NII and fee increases, as well as higher mortgage hedging results.
Expenses were down despite $16 million restructuring-related charges. Due to a combination of our efficiency efforts, mortgage repurchase expense declined and lower variable compensation in capital markets.
Turning to Slide 7, look at some segment highlights. In the regional bank, pretax income was $73 million, up 13% linked quarter. Revenues in the bank increased 2%. Expenses were down 3%, and we booked a provision credit in the bank of $13.7 million compared to $12.4 million last quarter. Capital markets' pretax income declined to $17 million from $22 million linked quarter as revenues decreased 13%. Lower variable comp gross expenses down 9%. Fixed income average daily revenues declined to $1.1 million from $1.3 million, as market conditions continue to result in cautious buying activity.
In our corporate segment, we had a pretax loss of $27 million compared to loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Second quarter in the Corporate segment is where we include the $16.6 million of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency charges, as well as a $3.4 million interest related to tax refund which is booked in other income. Remember that the first quarter included $3.1 million of restructuring charges, a $5.8 million gain from the redemption of our TRUPs and a $3.3 million reversal of our Visa contingent liability.
In the non-strategic segment, the pretax loss narrowed to $11 million in the second quarter. Net hedging results were $15.4 million this quarter compared to $12.5 million in the first. Non-strategic expenses decreased as mortgage repurchase provision expense declined, and I'll go into that a little more detail in a few slides.
A note on Durban [ph]. We expect that the impact from the final decision should be about a $15 million to $20 million annual hit to our revenue. However, we believe that the impact should substantially be mitigated by the implementation of new sources of revenue. So, for example, we're charging noncustomers to use our delivery systems or increasing existing transactional and product fees, or reducing fee waivers, and we're modifying our checking product suite.
Turning to NIM and balance sheet on Slide 8. The consolidated NIM was relatively stable at 3.20% compared to 3.22% in the first, and core business NIM was 3.57%. And we expect the NIM to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Linked quarter, total asses remained stable as well at approximately $25 billion. The regional banks' period-end loans, as Bryan talked about, were up 3%, and the non-strategic loans declined 5%, resulting in modest net growth in total loans.
New commercial loan spreads were at 365 basis points, up 19 basis points from last year and were flat linked quarter. As we've emphasized, we are replacing lower-quality, lower-yield loans with higher-quality, higher-spread loans across the bank. In fact, the net growth we saw on the bank versus the runoff in non-strategic should generate 2x the NII annually.
On Slide 9, let's talk a little bit about the successful execution showing up in our loan pipeline trends. Bryan talked about our bankers' successful calling efforts, and that execution is reflected in the year-over-year growth of our commercial loan pipeline and our close-end funded commercial loans. We are seeing demand in the C&I space, especially from our corporate borrowers and asset-based lending borrowers. We've also seen some opportunity in new CRE customers. In our regional bank, commercial-funded loans have increased by 67% since last year at higher spreads. Overall, pricing spreads are favorable, but we do expect continued pricing pressure in the market.
Moving on to productivity and efficiency on Slide 10. The linked quarter consolidated expenses declined 2% to $309 million. As I mentioned earlier, that includes that $16.6 million restructuring. Recent efficiency actions including streamlining the regional bank structure, reducing cost and procurement, reducing cost and technology, as well as numerous other back-office functions.
As Bryan talked about, we've now identified $110 million in annual cost saves, with an annualized $50 million executed already and in our 2Q '11 run rate. The remaining $60 million is expected to be largely executed by the end of '11, and we will continue to execute on getting our cost down to achieve our targeted efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 11, talk a little bit about mortgage repurchase. Linked quarter, our pipeline declined 15% to $451 million, and our repurchase provision expense declined 34% to $24.6 million, marking the fourth consecutive quarter decline. Net realized losses were relatively flat at $38.5 million, and we decreased reserves by $14 million from last quarter. Rescission rates improved but are still within our range of 45% to 55%, and severity remains steady at 50% to 60%. Linked quarter, you see that new requests were down 18%, and resolutions were up 10%. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe that GSE mortgage repurchase request volume should continue to decline. And, again, we do not have any private securitization repurchase request to date.
Turning to Slide 12. Let me take a few minutes to discuss private securitizations, as they've recently become a hot topic again, in light of Bank of America's announced settlement. Though comparisons to their settlement has been made regarding our securitizations, we believe there is significant differences that make those comparisons less relevant. Our view of our potential risk here has remained consistent over time. 
Looking at the bottom of the slide, there are a few data points which may help you analyze this. We achieved about $33 billion of private securitizations between '04 and '07, of which 40% was jumbo and 60% or so was Alt-A, and we did not have any subprime securitizations.
As I've said before, we have had no repurchase request from these securitizations to date and have 3 previously disclosed lawsuits, one of which has been withdrawn. Our securitizations have generally performed favorably overall to industry cohort benchmarks. Our reps and warranties on private securitizations are generally more limited than for GSEs. And so, as we sit here, of course, we kindle everything, particularly since we've had no private securitization requests. But sitting here today, considering the differences between the private securitization, the $33 billion originated between '04 and '07 and the $70 billion of GSE volume originated between '05 and '08, the more limited nature of the reps and warranties and the procedural differences of initiating repurchase range versus GSEs, the disclosures in the securitization prospectuses, the relative performance versus industry cohorts of our securitizations and the mix of our securitizations versus the industry, we believe it's unlikely that our private securitization risk is greater than our repurchase experience with GSEs, which have been manageable as an earnings headwind.
You can see on Slide 13 our asset quality trends continue to improve. Loan loss provision was flat at $1 million. Linked quarter, net charge-offs declined 14% to $66 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $524 million. The reserve-to-loan ratio remained strong at 3.26% at the end of the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 14. Nonperforming assets declined 9% linked quarter. Commercial and close decreased by 35%, and resolutions were up 40%. Lower inflows were driven by continued credit stabilization in our commercial portfolios.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. We're continuing to make progress towards reaching our long-term bonefish goals. Our core business are away within an annualized 1.06% in the quarter, and our core NIM was at 3.57%. We're taking steps towards achieving higher returns by controlling what we can control, continuing to better position our balance sheet by replacing lower-yielding non-strategic loans with higher-spread loans in the bank. We're improving productivity and efficiency, and we're decreasing our credit environmental cost. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan."

We have a strong core banking and capital markets businesses. We have strengthened these businesses by our team's efforts to win new clients and grow organically by our continued investments in systems and processes to help us provide unparalleled customer service, and by our steps to make us a significantly more efficient company.
We have a strong capital base, and we have made solid progress on credit quality and our pipeline of mortgage repurchase requests. Our bonefish tool is widely used in organization and serves as a constant reminder that we are managing the company for profitability and strong returns to our shareholders.
Our top priority for the remainder of this year and next year is to continue to focus on improving profitability and the long-term earnings power of the core franchise. We are working on our blocking and tackling daily, actively calling on new and existing retail and commercial customers, improving spreads, managing our fee revenue and reducing our cost of doing business.
Our strong capital levels give us a significant level of flexibility. We are committed to investing that capital in a disciplined manner. Our principal goal is to increase value to our shareholders, as we prudently evaluate our options, invest in organic growth, potential mergers and acquisitions and/or increase dividend and stock buybacks, based on which option best meets our goal.
We believe that excess capital should be returned to our shareholders when it cannot be attractively invested in organic growth or well-priced deals. Expanding our business by investing capital in well-priced, value-creating mergers and acquisitions is still a priority, but it does not take precedent over our goal to increase value for our shareholders. We look forward to executing on our strategic priorities and remain committed to producing consistently attractive returns for shareholders.

We -- I mentioned the bonefish tool, and you talked about the culture. We spent a lot of time and energy in the organization, and people, as I said in the prepared remarks, really do focus on the bonefish tool. It's a way we measure performance in the organization, and it's driven by driving profitability. And I think we've made great progress in that regard. I'm really encouraged by the usage that it's getting. The business is one that is going to be scalable over time. We thought we sort of hung around this $25 billion asset number. We're working to control our costs, and we're going to be driven by how the bonefish drives our results. So we're going to look to book profitable loans. If we have fewer profitable loans that we can book, we'll control our costs and we'll fit into that right side, but we're going to scale the business to drive profitability. The pipelines have been strong. The second quarter was strong, particularly with our corporate borrowers. We saw good volume there. We saw our pipelines build significantly over the last several quarters, and they continued strong end of the third quarter. So we feel like we've got very strong momentum, and encouraged by the call-in efforts that we see going on in the business and the results of this call-in efforts, it is still a competitive environment. There is a lot of pressure still on pricing and structure, more so at this point in the credit cycle than we would have expected. But we do think that we're doing a good job competing in that environment. We're winning high-quality business. We're doing a good job, in my view, serving our customer base. And so I feel good about the momentum that we have in the businesses we sort of transitioned here into the third quarter."

So what we see within the book is continuing kind of improvement within credit grade categories. As it relates to opportunities we have, we were probably an early adapter because we were not heavy in income CRE compared to some of our competitors. What we see now -- so we also have seen in the second quarter and really at the end of first quarter, is some permanent market activity as well. So where you are taken out of loans and as we're putting new loans on, there's kind of a trade going there. So we're seeing good activity, and I think the good thing, Jon, is it's good to see some permanent activity. So you actually see a role of the book which is a positive thing as opposed to a stagnant book.

So once we get past that, it really comes back to normalization. If we look at continued operations this quarter, about $0.15 worth of earnings, you can add back the unusual items of $0.02, and that gets us to about $0.17 number. And then if you look at the non-strategic, so if we wipe out the loss that we have there, that $11 million loss, then you end up adding $0.03. However, we're not providing anything. So if you take the provision back to a normal level, you would take out $0.05. You don't do a lot of gymnastics to get down to kind of a still run rate around $0.15 or $0.60 per year. Bryan, if we go back and look at the $60 million in incremental savings that you're -- we're now still working towards and what have in place by the end of the year, that would add another $0.15. So that gets us potentially up to $0.75. Within the critical thing in my mind is that we kind of have to look for a normalized number around $1, which should be kind of a long-term goal. And there's really 2 levers to get there, which would be further efficiencies or share repurchase. So untapping those 2 things becomes pretty critical. And so I was just wondering, if we add another $40 million in expense savings, we have to take the regional banking kind of efficiency ratio down towards 60, and then getting about $500 million worth of share repurchase, that would give us the 20% accretion that could get us to $1. So all that financial engineering to get back to really 2 questions, can we see an additional $40 million to $50 million in expense savings? And is $500 million kind of the right bogey to think about eventually to be able to get back from the share repurchase?"

And we think that the banking overhead efficiency ratio ought to be in the high-50s over time. But we've got to operate too and continue to do that, and we will. And on the capital side, as I mentioned earlier, that's still going to evolve, but that's an area that we're focused on. We recognize that we have greater capital in the organization today than we believe we need to run it long term. And we'll look for ways to be repatriate that to our shareholders, either in dividend or stock buyback, if we can't put it to work attractively in organic growth or otherwise. So we're going to work through that process with the regulators on an appropriate fashion and at an appropriate time, we'll deal with that."

From the conversations we have with customers, it's still mixed. There are some customers, principally our larger customers, that are becoming more confident. There seems to be some disparity on what segment of the economy is being served, whether it's the consumer segment or whether it tends to be more of a manufacturing base of the segment -- of the economy.

So I think the pace decreases in terms of the healing because we're getting closer and closer. But if you look at our coverage ratios, we still see, we still have the decent coverage in the regional bank, in the income CRE, as an example. And so I think you'll continue to see releases into -- a little bit into to future. And at some point in time, it stabilizes. The other side of the equation obviously is the non-strategic. And the C&I portfolio in the CRE portfolios and non-strategic is almost wound down x the trough. So I think that just continues to play out over the next foreseeable future."

I feel good about the momentum in the balance sheet. I feel good about the momentum in our revenue streams. And as we said at the very beginning, we're working real hard to control what we can control, winning customer business, serving those customers well, getting more efficient and growing the business in a thoughtful and profitable manner for our shareholders.

During the second quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities. We made headway in optimizing our business mix for profitability and returns, as the regional bank's pretax income increased 13% linked quarter, and the non-strategic segments drag decreased. We improved productivity and efficiency with overall expenses down 2% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Net income rose 6% to $43 million.
We are controlling what we can control in our company and making progress on our strategic priorities. Our bankers are focusing on profitably increasing market share with superior customer service. We have made more than 14,000 customer calls year-to-date, resulting in 3% period-end loan growth in the regional banking.
In our C&I portfolio, growth was encouraging as period-end loans were up 5%. The increase was driven by loans to mortgage companies and our corporate borrowers. Commercial loans, excluding loans to mortgage companies, were up 1%. We are positioning our balance sheet for higher returns by replacing low yielding non-strategic loans with better-priced, more profitable relationship-oriented loans. Our success in expanding and deepening customer relationships benefited revenues in the bank, as net interest income was up 1% and fees increased 2% from last quarter.
Capital markets continues to be a strong contributor to our overall fee income. Capital markets' average daily revenue was $1.1 million, down from last quarter's $1.3 million, but within our normalized range of expected revenues.
We made additional progress towards achieving our productivity and efficiency targets, having identified $110 million in annual cost savings. This $110 million of annualized savings is in our expense based run rate, and we have identified for execution another $60 million to be mostly completed by the end of 2011. BJ will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we took actions to streamline our company as we reorganized our structure, simplified our lines of business and made investments in technology. These actions should result in our becoming more flexible and nimble to serve our customers better.
Our strategic expenses declined 15% linked quarter due to a 34% reduction in mortgage repurchase provision expense. Our goal is to achieve a full year 2013 consolidated expense base that is 20% to 25% less than full year 2010 consolidated expenses of $1.3 billion. Achieving our goal should enable us to reach a 60% to 65% efficiency ratio sometime in 2013. Our efficiency goal also assumes ongoing investments in people, products and technology. From 2009 to the end of this year, we will invest in more than $100 million in system upgrades and technology.
Credit quality trends also improved as nonperformers and net charge-offs declined. Provision expense was unchanged at $1 million in the second quarter. We're seeing continued stabilization in our commercial loan portfolio. Additionally, enhanced collection efforts have helped lower delinquencies in our consumer portfolio.
All in all, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in successfully executing on our strategic priorities. BJ will now take you through the second quarter's financial results, and I'll be back with some closing comments before we take your questions. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Signific",1431,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Second quarter's net income available to common was $43 million, an increase of 6% from last quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.16 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.01 a year ago. Significant items totaled $16.6 million and were related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives. Major items include $7.5 million of expense from employee severance costs in that number and a $9 million charge to terminate a technology services contract, which will create efficiencies going forward.
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of First Horizon Insurance, and we recognized a $4.2 million after-tax gain, which you can see in discontinued operations. Revenues were down primarily due to lower fixed income in capital markets, offsetting bank NII and fee increases, as well as higher mortgage hedging results.
Expenses were down despite $16 million restructuring-related charges. Due to a combination of our efficiency efforts, mortgage repurchase expense declines and lower variable compensation in capital markets.
Turning to Slide 7, look at some segment highlights. In the regional bank, pretax income was $73 million, up 13% linked quarter. Revenues in the bank increased 2%. Expenses were down 3%, and we booked a provision credit in the bank of $13.7 million compared to $12.4 million last quarter. Capital markets' pretax income declined to $17 million from $22 million linked quarter as revenues decreased 13%. Lower variable comp gross expenses down 9%. Fixed income average daily revenues declined to $1.1 million from $1.3 million, as market conditions continue to result in cautious buying activity.
In our corporate segment, we had a pretax loss of $27 million compared to loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Second quarter in the Corporate segment is where we include the $16.6 million of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency charges, as well as a $3.4 million interest related to tax refund which is booked in other income. Remember that the first quarter included $3.1 million of restructuring charges, a $5.8 million gain from the redemption of our TRUPs and a $3.3 million reversal of our Visa contingent liability.
In the non-strategic segment, the pretax loss narrowed to $11 million in the second quarter. Net hedging results were $15.4 million this quarter compared to $12.5 million in the first. Non-strategic expenses decreased as mortgage repurchase provision expense declined, and I'll go into that a little more detail in a few slides.
A note on Durban. We expect that the impact from the final decision should be about a $15 million to $20 million annual hit to our revenue. However, we believe that the impact should substantially be mitigated by the implementation of new sources of revenue. So, for example, we're charging noncustomers to use our delivery systems or increasing existing transactional and product fees, or reducing fee waivers, and we're modifying our checking product suite.
Turning to NIM and balance sheet on Slide 8. The consolidated NIM was relatively stable at 3.20% compared to 3.22% in the first, and our core business NIM was 3.57%. And we expect the NIM to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Linked quarter, total assets remained stable as well at approximately $25 billion. The regional banks' period-end loans, as Bryan talked about, were up 3%, and the non-strategic loans declined 5%, resulting in modest net growth in total loans.
New commercial loan spreads were at 365 basis points, up 19 basis points from last year and were flat linked quarter. As we've emphasized, we are replacing lower-quality, lower-yield loans with higher-quality, higher-spread loans across the bank. In fact, the net growth we saw on the bank versus the runoff in non-strategic should generate 2x the NII annually.
On Slide 9, let's talk a little bit about the successful execution showing up in our loan pipeline trends. Bryan talked about our bankers' successful calling efforts, and that execution is reflected in the year-over-year growth of our commercial loan pipeline and our close-end funded commercial loans. We are seeing demand in the C&I space, especially from our corporate borrowers and asset-based lending borrowers. We've also seen some opportunity in new CRE customers. In our regional bank, commercial-funded loans have increased by 67% since last year at higher spreads. Overall, pricing spreads are favorable, but we do expect continued pricing pressure in the market.
Moving on to productivity and efficiency on Slide 10. The linked quarter consolidated expenses declined 2% to $309 million. As I mentioned earlier, that includes that $16.6 million restructuring. Recent efficiency actions including streamlining the regional bank structure, reducing cost and procurement, reducing cost and technology, as well as numerous other back-office functions.
As Bryan talked about, we've now identified $110 million in annual cost saves, with an annualized $50 million executed already and in our 2Q '11 run rate. The remaining $60 million is expected to be largely executed by the end of '11, and we will continue to execute on getting our cost down to achieve our targeted efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 11, talk a little bit about mortgage repurchase. Linked quarter, our pipeline declined 15% to $451 million, and our repurchase provision expense declined 34% to $24.6 million, marking the fourth consecutive quarter decline. Net realized losses were relatively flat at $38.5 million, and we decreased reserves by $14 million from last quarter. Rescission rates improved but are still within our range of 45% to 55%, and severity remains steady at 50% to 60%. Linked quarter, you see that new requests were down 18%, and resolutions were up 10%. Based on the vintage mix and the fact that we did not originate any new GSE loans after August '08, we believe that GSE mortgage repurchase request volume should continue to decline. And, again, we do not have any private securitization repurchase request to date.
Turning to Slide 12. Let me take a few minutes to discuss private securitizations, as they've recently become a hot topic again, in light of Bank of America's announced settlement. Though comparisons to their settlement have been made regarding our securitizations, we believe there is significant differences that make those comparisons less relevant. Our view of our potential risk here has remained consistent over time. 
Looking at the bottom of the slide, there are a few data points which may help you analyze this. We achieved about $33 billion of private securitizations between '04 and '07, of which 40% was jumbo and 60% or so was Alt-A, and we did not have any subprime securitizations.
As I've said before, we have had no repurchase request from these securitizations to date and have 3 previously disclosed lawsuits, one of which has been withdrawn. Our securitizations have generally performed favorably overall to industry cohort benchmarks. Our reps and warranties on private securitizations are generally more limited than for GSEs. And so, as we sit here, of course, we kindle everything, particularly since we've had no private securitization requests. But sitting here today, considering the differences between the private securitization, the $33 billion originated between '04 and '07 and the $70 billion of GSE volume originated between '05 and '08, the more limited nature of the reps and warranties and the procedural differences of initiating repurchased range versus GSEs, the disclosures in the securitization prospectuses, the relative performance versus industry cohorts of our securitizations and the mix of our securitizations versus the industry, we believe it's unlikely that our private securitization risk is greater than our repurchase experience with GSEs, which have been manageable as an earnings headwind.
You can see on Slide 13 our asset quality trends continue to improve. Loan loss provision was flat at $1 million. Linked quarter, net charge-offs declined 14% to $66 million, and we decreased reserve 11% to $524 million. The reserve-to-loan ratio remained strong at 3.26% at the end of the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 14. Nonperforming assets declined 9% linked quarter. Commercial and closed decreased by 35%, and resolutions were up 40%. Lower inflows were driven by continued credit stabilization in our commercial portfolios.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. We're continuing to make progress towards reaching our long-term bonefish goals. Our core business are away within an annualized 1.06% in the quarter, and our core NIM was at 3.57%. We're taking steps towards achieving higher returns by controlling what we can control, continuing to better position our balance sheet by replacing lower-yielding non-strategic loans with higher-spread loans in the bank. We're improving productivity and efficiency, and we're decreasing our credit environmental cost. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan."

We have a strong core banking and capital markets businesses. We have strengthened these businesses by our team's efforts to win new clients and grow organically by our continued investments in systems and processes to help us provide unparalleled customer service, and by our steps to make us a significantly more efficient company.
We have a strong capital base, and we have made solid progress on credit quality and our pipeline of mortgage repurchase requests. Our bonefish tool is widely used in organization and serves as a constant reminder that we are managing the company for profitability and strong returns to our shareholders.
Our top priority for the remainder of this year and next year is to continue to focus on improving profitability and the long-term earnings power of the core franchise. We are working on our blocking and tackling daily, actively calling on new and existing retail and commercial customers, improving spreads, managing our fee revenue and reducing our cost of doing business.
Our strong capital levels give us a significant level of flexibility. We are committed to investing that capital in a disciplined manner. Our principal goal is to increase value to our shareholders, as we prudently evaluate our options, invest in organic growth, potential mergers and acquisitions and/or increase dividend and stock buybacks, based on which option best meets our goal.
We believe that excess capital should be returned to our shareholders when it cannot be attractively invested in organic growth or well-priced deals. Expanding our business by investing capital in well-priced, value-creating mergers and acquisitions is still a priority, but it does not take precedent over our goal to increase value for our shareholders. We look forward to executing on our strategic priorities and remain committed to producing consistently attractive returns for shareholders.

We -- I mentioned the bonefish tool, and you talked about the culture. We spent a lot of time and energy in the organization, and people, as I said in the prepared remarks, really do focus on the bonefish tool. It's a way we measure performance in the organization, and it's driven by driving profitability. And I think we've made great progress in that regard. I'm really encouraged by the usage that it's getting. The business is one that is going to be scalable over time. We thought we sort of hung around this $25 billion asset number. We're working to control our costs, and we're going to be driven by how the bonefish drives our results. So we're going to look to book profitable loans. If we have fewer profitable loans that we can book, we'll control our costs and we'll fit into that right side, but we're going to scale the business to drive profitability. The pipelines have been strong. The second quarter was strong, particularly with our corporate borrowers. We saw good volume there. We saw our pipelines build significantly over the last several quarters, and they continued strong end of the third quarter. So we feel like we've got very strong momentum, and encouraged by the call-in efforts that we see going on in the business and the results of this call-in efforts, it is still a competitive environment. There is a lot of pressure still on pricing and structure, more so at this point in the credit cycle than we would have expected. But we do think that we're doing a good job competing in that environment. We're winning high-quality business. We're doing a good job, in my view, serving our customer base.

Within income CRE, if you think about the vintages of '05 to '07 where there was some kind of a peak, and so as we've been working through those, that has turned better than I would have expected as the CRE market is more stable than I expected in early fourth quarter. So what we see within the book is a continuing kind of improvement within credit grade categories. As it relates to opportunities we have, we were probably an early adapter because we were not heavy in income CRE compared to some of our competitors. What we see now -- so we also have seen in the second quarter and really at the end of first quarter, is some permanent market activity as well. So where you are taken out of loans and as we're putting new loans on, there's kind of a trade going there. So we're seeing good activity, and I think the good thing, Jon, is it's good to see some permanent activity. So you actually see a role of the book which is a positive thing as opposed to a stagnant book. So like this is moving in the right direction, I think there is an increasing competition in CRE from what we saw in the fourth quarter and the beginning of -- into the first quarter.

So once we get past that, it really comes back to normalization. If we look at continued operations this quarter, about $0.15 worth of earnings, you can add back the unusual items of $0.02, and that gets us to about $0.17 number. And then if you look at the non-strategic, so if we wipe out the loss that we have there, that $11 million loss, then you end up adding $0.03. However, we're not providing anything. So if you take the provision back to a normal level, you would take out $0.05. You don't do a lot of gymnastics to get down to kind of a still run rate around $0.15 or $0.60 per year. Bryan, if we go back and look at the $60 million in incremental savings that you're -- we're now still working towards and what have in place by the end of the year, that would add another $0.15. So that gets us potentially up to $0.75. Within the critical thing in my mind is that we kind of have to look for a normalized number around $1, which whould be kind of a long-term goal. And there's really 2 levers to get there, which would be further efficiencies or share repurchase. So untapping those 2 things becomes pretty critical. And so I was just wondering, if we add another $40 million in expense savings, we have to take the regional banking kind of efficiency ratio down towards 60, and then getting about $500 million worth of share repurchase, that would give us the 20% accretion that could get us to $1. So all that financial engineering to get back to really 2 questions, can we see an additional $40 million to $50 million in expense savings? And is $500 million kind of the right bogey to think about eventually to be able to get back from the share repurchase?"

That means we've to get the efficiencies that we've talked about this morning and probably a little bit more. It means that we've got to get some of these environmental or credit cycle kinds of cost reducing. It means we'll probably get a little bit of continued help on the revenue side, but we think we can do that. And we think that the banking overhead efficiency ratio ought to be in the high-50s over time. But we've got an opportunity to do that, and we will. And on the capital side, as I mentioned earlier, that's still going to evolve, but that's an area that we're focused on. We recognize that we have greater capital in the organization today than we believe we need to run it long term. And we'll look for ways to be repatriate that to our shareholders, either in dividend or stock buyback, if we can't put it to work attractively in organic growth or otherwise.

Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income was up",725,"Thank you, Aarti. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income was up 26% linked quarter, and Capital Markets revenues increased 26%.
We made progress in lowering expenses in our core businesses. Balance sheet trends were favorable with period end loans up 1%. Average core deposits up 2%, and consolidated net interest margin was up modestly. We also made headway in exiting Non-Strategic business by selling about $150 million of nonperforming loans.
On Slide 4. We're making solid progress in strengthening our core businesses and working hard to overcome economic and regulatory headwinds. Our bankers are focused on providing exceptional service, expanding customer relationship and proactively soliciting new business. As a result, we've seen solid market share gains across our footprint. According to recent FDIC data, our deposits in Tennessee increased 6.5% over last year compared to the 2.5% growth rate in the markets we serve. We retained our top ranking in our west and east regions, and we continue to make progress in middle Tennessee. For the second year in a row, we outpaced the market in Nashville as our deposits grew 7.4%, and our share increased 30 basis points.
We're also seeing an encouraging loan growth trends. Today, our bankers have made almost 40,000 calls on existing and prospective customers. This effort has paid off as period end loans in the regional bank were up 5% from last quarter, driven by loans to mortgage companies, corporate borrowers and asset-based lending. We remain focused on replacing our lower yielding Non-Strategic loans with better priced relationship created assets. Again, our strategy is working.
Despite competitive loan pricing pressures, loan yield and the bank were relatively stable from second to third quarter.
The regional bank posted 2% total revenue growth second to third quarter, driven by higher net interest income and steady fee income. Implementation of the Durbin amendment this month will pressure banking industry fees, and we expect roughly a $20 million impact to annual revenue.
To offset lost revenue, we continue to make pricing adjustments, but we are taking a thoughtful approach to make sure we provide true customer value. For example, beginning later this month, we are initiating a $0.04 per charge per PIN debit transaction, $0.14 cents on signature transactions and capping the monthly fee at a maximum of $3.
Capital Markets had a strong quarter with fixed income averaging daily, with fixed income average daily revenue increasing 28% to $1.4 million in the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our unique business model, which is focused on distribution and not proprietary trading, combined with the depth and diversification of our customer base across the depository and non-depository sectors positioned us well for market conditions.
Productivity and efficiency improvement remains a top priority for us. We made good progress in the third quarter, with regional bank expenses down 4% and an improved efficiency ratio of 66% in the bank. However, environmental costs remain elevated as mortgage repurchase provision expense increased from last quarter.
In our core businesses, we are on track with our efficiency initiatives and now expect $124 million in cost savings. We estimate that we realized an annualized $88 million of cost saves in our third quarter run rate.
Our productivity efforts are starting to pay off. For example, revenue per FTE in the regional bank increased 5% from last quarter. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving the 60% to 65% consolidated efficiency ratio.
Turning to credit quality. We were able to accelerate the reduction of our nonperforming loans, selling approximately $150 million in net book value of nonperformers. These NPLs were mostly in our Non-Strategic Permanent Mortgage portfolio, and the loss on sale impacted third quarter provision by $36 million. 
For the quarter, consolidated provision was $32 million, and total net charge-offs were $106 million. The loan sales impacted third quarter charge-offs accounting for 45% of total net charge-offs.
To sum up. Third quarter results demonstrated that we are continuing to successfully execute, as I said, controlling what we can control, which is resulting in a solid core business performance. BJ will now take you through the detailed financial review and I'll be back with some closing comments. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and the earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Co",1497,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and the earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Core business net income was $94 million compared to $27 million in the second quarter. While third quarter's bottom line was solid, there were also some significant items. We executed nonperforming loan sales, as Bryan said, approximating $150 million in net book value. Provision impact on loss on these sales was $36 million. We also sold some piece of shares in the third quarter for a securities gains of $35 million. Expenses related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives were $2 million, down from $17 million in the second quarter. And additionally, I think as previously announced, divestiture resulted in an after-tax gain of about $5 million with discontinued ops.
Moving to Slide 7. Take a look at some segment highlights. Pretax income in the regional bank increased to $93 million from $74 million in the second quarter. We booked a provision credit of $22.7 million compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter, as we saw continued credit improvement in our loan portfolios. 
Revenues were up 2%. NII was up primarily from a higher volumes of loans to mortgage. Fees were stable. Regional bank expenses declined $6 million linked quarter, and were down $15 million from third quarter 2010. 
In our capital market segment, pretax income increased to $28 million in the third quarter compared to a pretax loss of $20 million in the second, which included a $36.7 million litigation settlement expense. Fixed income average daily revenues increased $1.4 million in the third quarter from $1.1 million in the second quarter. Growth in average daily revenues reflects the strength of our extensive distribution network and our substantial penetration of the depository customer segment, combined with favorable market conditions. 
Following the feds early August announcement of an extended loan rate interest rate environment, we saw our customers begin to deploy a greater amount of their excess liquidity, resulting in increased fixed income buying activity. Since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales and distribution activities on the behalf of our clients, we benefit when there is strong buying activity while avoiding significant negative trading results experienced by the firms.
We believe that in the near term, fixed income average daily revenues could stay elevated within this range. However, it's always that performance remains sensitive to interest rate changes and the overall economic environment other factors. 
In Corporate segment, pretax income was $19 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $27 million in the second. Third quarter included $35 million in securities gains from the sale of Visa stock and lower restructuring of expenses. 
In the Non-Strategic second, pretax income was a loss of $98 million compared to a loss of $13 million in the second quarter. The increase pretax loss was driven by higher loan loss provisions, primarily driven by the loan sales. We increased mortgage repurchase provision expense, as well as elevated cost from the transfer to a new self-services and a negative adjustment in our mortgage warehouse valuations.
On Slide 8, we'll take a look at balance sheet and then net interest margin trends. Consolidated net interest margin was relatively stable at 3.23% compared to 3.20% in the second quarter. Core business net interest margin was 3.52%. Positive drivers for margin included higher loan volume, lower deposit costs, which were somewhat offset by lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio. Over the next several quarters, we expect to defend the margins by replacing lower yielding non-strategic assets with better priced regional bank assets further reducing deposit pricing and experiencing less of a drag from nonperformers. However, there's likely to be continued pressure with lower reinvestment yields in the securities portfolio, and margin is likely to decline modestly by a few basis points per quarter over the next several quarters.
As you can see on Slide 9, loan pipeline trends in our regional bank continue to be encouraging as loan commitments and loans funded are up compared to last year. Although borrowers remain cautious, we're seeing areas of demand from customers in our corporate asset-based lending CRE and mortgage warehouse lending segment. With revenue, demand pricing a structure remains competitive. Our loan yields in the regional bank were relatively stable at 4.01% compared to last quarter's yield at 4.02%. Given the competitive environment, we expect yields will be under pressure. Nonetheless, new loans being booking in the regional bank continue to be better priced than regional banking and non-strategic assets that are running off our balance sheet.
Moving to expenses on Slide 10. We're very pleased with our continued progress year. Consolidated expenses declined 6% from last quarter. Regional banking expenses decreased 4% as we continue to implement cost-saving initiatives. Productivity and efficiency actions in the third quarter include reductions of FTEs, lower discretionary spending and gaining efficiency from exited businesses. We will continue to evaluate efficiency actions such as consolidating branches and further process improvement. And we should also benefit from technology investments. Over the long term, we continue to target a 25% reduction from the level of 2010 consolidated expenses, mostly by the end of 2013.
Moving onto mortgage repurchase on Slide 11. Linked quarter, mortgage repurchase provision expense increased to $53 million from $25 million. Net realized losses matched provision leaving reserves flat at $169 million. The rescission rate stayed steady in July and August, but trended lower in September reflecting a higher mix of mortgage insurance related resolutions, leading to higher loss content. 
In the quarter, the GSCs made a push to results unresolved repurchase claims based on MI coverage loss. To some extent, this accelerated charge-offs and contributed to third quarter higher level of losses. Our operational pipeline dropped from $451 million to $418 million with new request of $200 million and resolution of $237 million. The operational pipeline includes request where mortgage insurance calculations are under review. Once this coverage is lost, it comes out of our operational pipeline, but we continue to consider these loans in the reserve calculation.
The GSC appear to be more aggressive than the recovery efforts. Quarter to quarter, we are likely to see volatility in repurchase expense from the variances in the mix of both inflows and resolutions. Sitting here today, we expect our repurchase inflows to be reasonably steady, resolutions to continue to be strong and we also still believe we're on the backside of GSE-related repurchase request.
Moving to Slide 12, for a minute, on private mortgage securitizations. We still have had no repurchase request from resecuritization to date. We still currently have 4 lawsuits related to private mortgage securitization completing the FHFA lawsuit. Our private mortgage securitization have generally performed favorably overall of the industry cohort benchmarks. As you can see on the slide, 66% of private mortgage securitizations are outperforming industry cohort on cue loss, and 81% of these securitizations are outperforming cohorts on 60-day-plus delinquencies. 
Our mix is different. We did no subprime, and additionally, reps and warranties are genetically more limited than for GSE hold-on sales. Considering the differences between the private securitizations and GSE loans that we've outlined on the slide, we continue to believe right now that our private securitization risk is likely to become significantly less than our experience with GSEs, which continues to be manageable as the earnings headwinds.
Moving to asset quality on Slide 13. Credit quality metrics continue to be positive. NPAs declined. Net charge-offs, excluding the loan sales, were down. Loan sales of about $150 million and net book value included $126 million from our perm mortgage portfolio and about $24 million from our commercial loan portfolio. UPB on the sold loans was $220 million, reflecting a 47% blended mark on the loan sales. Reserves decreased $74 million including $12 million associated with the loan sales. Despite several quarters, the reserve releases or reserves to loans remained healthy at $277 million. Given that our credit quality trends are generally favorable, we expect additional reserve releases, but the rate of reserve decrease could slow down depending on the economic environment.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonperforming assets declined to 22% linked quarter primarily due to the loan sales and upgrades in the commercial portfolio. In addition, the broad-based improvement in our loan portfolios, we expect that the sale of our nonperforming should be favorable to overall credit quality metrics in the future.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. Our core businesses showed good progress in reaching our long-term targets as we focus on controlling what we can control with solid trends in the regional bank, continued strong performance in our Capital Markets business and improving productivity and efficiency. Although the Non-Strategic segment and mortgage repurchase remain a drag, I'm pleased with the momentum in the bank and in our Capital Markets business. Bryan?"

With the latter, the reserve is harder to pinpoint because you obviously have to look at the mix of resolutions and inflows and all that kind of stuff on a forward-looking basis. But from a charge-off perspective, the way I see it is this was an acceleration in this quarter. And therefore, the realized losses that we saw this quarter may, in fact, be elevated or high. And I would expect that charge-offs may very likely come down from this level over the next few quarters. Again, the provision itself will depend on how we look at the reserve and the mix of it, but I would expect that the actual charge-offs may likely come down."

That's consistent with what we've been saying for an extended period of time. Our mortgage repurchase exposure, BJ talked a fair amount about both the GSEs and the private. We do think we're on the backside with the GSCs with 3 years out from the last loan we originated and sold to the GSCs, the private securitizations for the reasons that BJ described in detail. We feel that the private securitization exposure is likely to be significantly less than the exposure to the GSCs. And we think that it will manage below the earnings headwinds. So from our perspective, our balance sheet is getting better. I think our balance sheet is better today than it was 3 months ago. I think it's better than it was 6 months ago. I think it's better than it was a 1.5 year ago. So I think every quarter, our balance sheet continues to get better, and some of these actions do resolve nonperforming assets, the residential mortgages that we've talked about, the NPA sales. So I feel good about our balance sheet, I feel good about our capital position and I feel good about the trajectory our business is on. I think our bankers, our capital market teams are executing very well in customer business. All of that said, we feel like we've got a very strong capital base. We think it's appropriate to manage that capital base smartly in a disciplined fashion. And then appropriate return excess capital shareholders, and that's the step we've taken."

Our losses in August were $13 million, and our losses in September were $29 million. The high watermark for any particular month over the last 18 months had been around $14.8 million or so. So that, coupled with the communication that we did receive from the GSEs as they wanted to resolve certain types of claims by 9/30, leads me to believe that there were certainly an acceleration of our charge-offs. So those are all things that we have contemplated, we have always contemplated in our reserve calculation. So even with a higher level of charge-offs, we didn't necessarily see higher level of reserves for future content based on what we see in the pipeline today, and what I call our operational pipeline continues to go down. So what that means is that we have folks literally working on claims once MI coverage is actually lost, there's literally nothing else for our folks to work on. So it comes out of our pipeline but it continues to be accounted for in our reserves. I see that as a positive sign because at some point, we don't have to work these anymore, and we're just waiting to literally resolve the paperwork on it one way or another. So I continue to see good progress, good trends, good work from our folks. And as I said before, I actually believe that the level of charge-offs are likely to be down over the next few quarters."

Third, we did note some subprime the securitization, and I think if you look at the industry mix, there was 30-plus percent of subprime done during this time period.

Good morning and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income",724,"Thank you, Aarti. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income was up 26% linked quarter, and capital markets revenues increased 26%.
We made progress in lowering expenses in our core businesses. Balance sheet trends were favorable with period end loans, up 1%; average core deposits, up 2%, and consolidated net interest margin was up modestly. We also made headway in exiting non-strategic business by selling about $150 million of nonperforming loans.
On Slide 4. We're making solid progress in strengthening our core businesses and working hard to overcome economic and regulatory headwinds. Our bankers are focused on providing exceptional service, expanding customer relationship and proactively soliciting new business. As a result, we've seen solid market share gains across our footprint. According to recent FDIC data, our deposits in Tennessee increased 6.5% over last year compared to the 2.5% growth rate in the markets we serve. We retained our top ranking in our west and east regions, and we continue to make progress in middle Tennessee. For a second year in a row, we outpaced the market in Nashville as our deposits grew 7.4% and our share increased 30 basis points.
We're also seeing an encouraging loan growth trends. Today, our bankers have made almost 40,000 calls on existing and prospective customers. This effort has paid off as period end loans in the regional bank were up 5% from last quarter, driven by loans to mortgage companies, corporate borrowers and asset-based lending. We remain focused on replacing our lower yielding non-strategic loan with better price relationship oriented assets. Again, our strategy is working.
Despite competitive loan pricing pressures, loan yields and the bank were relatively stable from second to third quarter.
The regional bank posted 2% total revenue growth second to third quarter, driven by higher net interest income and steady fee income. Implementation of the Durbin amendment this month will pressure banking industry fees, and we expect roughly a $20 million impact to annual revenue.
To offset lost revenue, we continue to make pricing adjustments, but we are taking a thoughtful approach to ensure we provide true customer value. For example, beginning later this month, we are initiating a $0.04 per charge per PIN debit transaction, $0.14 on signature transactions and capping the monthly fee at a maximum of $3.
Capital markets had a strong quarter with fixed income averaging daily -- with fixed income average daily revenue increasing 28% to $1.4 million in the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our unique business model, which is focused on distribution and not proprietary trading, combined with the depth and diversification of our customer base across the depository and non-depository sectors positioned us well for market conditions.
Productivity and efficiency improvement remains a top priority for us. We made good progress in the third quarter, with regional bank expenses down 4% and an improved efficiency ratio of 66% in the bank. However, environmental costs remain elevated as mortgage repurchase provision expense increased from last quarter.
In our core businesses, we are on track with our efficiency initiatives and now expect $124 million in cost savings. We estimate that we realized an annualized $88 million of cost saves in our third quarter run rate.
Our productivity efforts are starting to pay off. For example, revenue per FTE in the regional bank increased 5% from last quarter. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving the 60% to 65% consolidated efficiency ratio.
Turning to credit quality. We were able to accelerate the reduction of our nonperforming loans, selling approximately $150 million in net book value of nonperformers. These NPLs were mostly in our non-strategic permanent mortgage portfolio, and the loss on sale impacted third quarter provision by $36 million.
For the quarter, consolidated provision was $32 million and total net charge-offs were $106 million. The loan sales impacted third quarter charge-offs, accounting for 45% of total net charge-offs.
To sum up, third quarter results demonstrated that we are continuing to successfully execute, as I said, controlling what we can control, which is resulting in solid core business performance. BJ will now take you through the detailed financial review, and I'll be back with some closing comments. BJ?"
272721,141272076,172924,"First Horizon National Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","First Horizon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and our earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Co",1499,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and our earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Core business net income was $94 million compared to $27 million in the second quarter. While third quarter's bottom line was solid, there were also some significant items. We executed nonperforming loan sales, as Bryan said, approximating $150 million in net book value. Provision impact from loss on these sales was $36 million. We also sold some piece of shares in the third quarter as a -- for a securities gain of $35 million. Expenses related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives were $2 million, down from $17 million in the second quarter; and additionally, a previously announced divestiture resulted in an after-tax gain of about $5 million within discontinued ops.
Moving to Slide 7. Take a look at some segment highlights. Pretax income in the regional bank increased to $94 million from $74 million in the second quarter. We booked a provision credit of $22.7 million compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter, as we saw continued credit improvement in our loan portfolios.
Revenues were up 2%. NII was up primarily from a higher volumes of loans to mortgage companies. Fees were stable. Regional bank expenses declined $6 million linked quarter and were down $15 million from third quarter 2010.
In our capital markets segment, pretax income increased to $28 million in the third quarter compared to a pretax loss of $20 million in the second, which included a $36.7 million litigation settlement expense. Fixed income average daily revenues increased to $1.4 million in the third quarter from $1.1 million in the second. Growth in average daily revenues reflects the strength of our extensive distribution network and our substantial penetration of the depository customer segment combined with favorable market conditions.
Following the Fed's early August announcement of an extended low rate interest rate environment, we saw our customers begin to deploy a greater amount of their excess liquidity, resulting in increased fixed income buying activity. Since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales and distribution activities on behalf of our clients, we benefit when there is strong buying activity while avoiding significant negative trading results experienced by the firms.
We believe that in the near term, fixed income average daily revenues could stay elevated within this range. However, as always, our performance remains sensitive to interest rate changes and the overall economic environment, among other factors.
In corporate segment, pretax income was $19 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $27 million in the second. Third quarter included $35 million in securities gains from the sale of Visa stock and lower restructuring expense. 
In the non-strategic segment, pretax income was a loss of $98 million compared to a loss of $13 million in the second quarter. The increased pretax loss was driven by a higher loan loss provision, primarily driven by the loan sales. We increased mortgage repurchase provision expense, as well as elevated cost from the transfer to a new sub-servicer and a negative adjustment in our mortgage warehouse valuation.
On Slide 8, we'll take a look at balance sheet and net interest margin trend. Consolidated net interest margin was relatively stable at 3.23% compared to 3.20% in the second quarter. Core business net interest margin was 3.52%. Positive drivers for margin included higher loan volume, lower deposit costs, which were somewhat offset by lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio. Over the next several quarters, we expect to defend the margin by replacing lower yielding non-strategic assets with better priced regional bank assets further reducing deposit pricing and experiencing less of a drag from nonperformers. However, there's likely to be continued pressure with lower reinvestment yields in the securities portfolio, and margin is likely to decline modestly by a few basis points per quarter over the next several quarters.
As you can see on Slide 9, loan pipeline trends in our regional bank continue to be encouraging as loan commitments and loans funded are up compared to last year. Although borrowers remain cautious, we're seeing areas of demand from customers in our corporate asset-based lending CRE and mortgage warehouse lending segment. With revenue demand, pricing and structure remains competitive. Our loan yields in the regional bank were relatively stable at 4.01% compared to last quarter's yield at 4.02%. Given the competitive environment, we expect yields will be under pressure. Nonetheless, new loans being booked in the regional bank continue to be better priced than regional banking and non-strategic assets that are running off our balance sheet.
Moving to expenses on Slide 10. We're very pleased with our continued progress here. Consolidated expenses declined 6% from last quarter. Regional banking expenses decreased 4% as we continue to implement cost-save initiatives. Productivity and efficiency actions in the third quarter include reductions of FTEs, lower discretionary spending and gaining efficiency from exited businesses. We will continue to evaluate efficiency actions such as consolidating branches and further process improvement, and we should also benefit from technology investments. Over the long term, we continue to target a 25% reduction from the level of 2010 consolidated expenses, mostly by the end of 2013.
Moving onto mortgage repurchase on Slide 11. Linked quarter, mortgage repurchase provision expense increased to $53 million from $25 million. Net realized losses matched provision, leaving reserves flat at $169 million. The rescission rate stayed steady in July and August but trended lower in September, reflecting a higher mix of mortgage insurance related resolutions, leading to higher loss content.
In the quarter, the GSEs made a push to resolve by September 30 unresolved repurchase claims based on MI coverage loss. To some extent, this accelerated charge-offs and contributed to third quarter's higher level of losses. Our operational pipeline dropped from $451 million to $418 million with new requests of $200 million and resolution of $237 million. The operational pipeline includes requests where mortgage insurance calculations are under review. Once this coverage is lost, it comes out of our operational pipeline, but we continue to consider these loans in the reserve calculation.
The GSEs appear to be more aggressive than the recovery efforts. Quarter-to-quarter, we are likely to see volatility in repurchase expense from the variances in the mix of both inflows and resolutions. Sitting here today, we expect our repurchase inflows to be reasonably steady, resolutions to continue to be strong, and we also still believe we're on the backside of GSE-related repurchase requests.
Moving to Slide 12, a minute on private mortgage securitizations. We still have had no repurchase requests from these securitizations to date. We still currently have 4 lawsuits related to private mortgage securitizations including the FHFA lawsuit. Our private mortgage securitizations have generally performed favorably overall of the industry cohort benchmarks. As you can see on this slide, 66% of private mortgage securitizations are outperforming industry cohort on cum loss, and 81% of these securitizations are outperforming cohorts on 60-day-plus delinquencies.
Our mix is different. We did no subprime, and additionally, reps and warranties are generally more limited than for GSE whole-loan sales. Considering the differences between the private securitizations and GSE loans that we've outlined on the slide, we continue to believe right now that our private securitization risk is likely to be significantly less than our experience with GSEs, which continues to be manageable as an earnings headwind.
Moving to asset quality on Slide 13. Credit quality metrics continue to be positive. NPAs declined. Net charge-offs, excluding the loan sales, were down. Loan sales of about $150 million and net book value included $126 million from our perm mortgage portfolio and about $24 million from our commercial loan portfolio. UPB on the sold loans was $220 million, reflecting a 47% blended mark on the loan sales. Reserves decreased $74 million, including $12 million associated with the loan sales. Despite several quarters, the reserve releases or reserves to loans remained healthy at $277 million. Given that our credit quality trends are generally favorable, we expect additional reserve releases, but the rate of reserve decrease could slow down depending on the economic environment.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonperforming assets declined 22% linked quarter, primarily due to the loan sales and upgrades in our commercial portfolios. In addition to broad-based improvement in our loan portfolios, we expect that the sale of nonperforming should be favorable to overall credit quality metrics in the future.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. Our core businesses showed good progress in reaching our long-term loans as target as we focus on controlling what we can control with solid trends in the regional bank, continued strong performance in our capital markets business and improving productivity and efficiency. Although the non-strategic segment and mortgage repurchase remain a drag, I'm pleased with the momentum in the bank and in our capital markets business. Bryan?"

So that, coupled with the communication that we did receive from the GSEs as they wanted to resolve certain types of claims by 9/30, leads me to believe that there was certainly an acceleration of our charge-offs. So those are all things that we have contemplated, we have always contemplated in our reserve calculations. So even with the higher level of charge-offs, you didn't necessarily see higher level of reserves for future content based on what we see in the pipeline today, and what I call our operational pipeline continues to go down. So what that means is we have folks literally working on claims once. MI coverage is actually lost, there's literally nothing else for our folks to work on. So it comes out of our pipeline, but it continues to be accounted for in our reserve. I see that as a positive sign as that at some point, we don't have to work these anymore, and we're just waiting to literally resolve the paperwork on it one way or the other.

Number two, we look at our performance versus industry to get a general feel of how we're performing. Third, we did no subprime securitization, and I think if you look at the industry mix, there was 30-plus percent of subprime done during this time period. So all of these things kind of put in a bucket, and the vis-a-vie settlement, whether or not it goes through, provided somewhat of a benchmark if you will. And as we outlined in the second quarter, our delinquencies and defaults relative to that portfolio are significantly better, and so we couple all that GSE stuff, couple anything that we know externally.

If there are -- there are factors that are just going to take awhile to work through, and it's not something that's going to be a quick resolution. That said, as you would expect, when we make application to or consult with our regulators to manage our capital level, we walk through stress testing the significant risks in the balance sheet. And we lay that out over time, and we lay it out and getting compared to where our balance sheet is, what our credit quality looks like, what our GSE exposures looks like, what our private label securities potentially exposure looks like, and we put all that together and we stress our capital. And we put forth a proposal, and the regulators are, they are with the organization and evaluate us on a long-term basis. So it's a process that is sort of all put together. It doesn't -- unfortunately, it doesn't work with the timeline in terms of when the GSEs or when the private label securities might come to a resolution. It's just going to take some time. As we said, we will continue to work on it. And I would add this, that in some sense, time is our friend when it comes to dealing with the GSEs and the private label securities. Every day that goes by, more loans pay down, more loans pay off. The exposure continues to reduce, and as we pointed out a couple of times, we haven't originated or sold any of these loans going back over 3 years and over that period. The last ones originated and sold were August of 2008. Over that period, you've gone through the worst housing crisis in possibly the nation's history, and we've gone through a 25-, 30-year high in unemployment.

Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income",721,"Thank you, Aarti. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities by controlling what we can control. Our core businesses performed well. Regional bank pretax income was up 26% linked quarter, and capital markets revenues increased 26%.
We made progress in lowering expenses in our core businesses. Balance sheet trends were favorable with period end loans up 1%, average core deposits up 2%, and consolidated net interest margin was up modestly. We also made headway in exiting non-strategic business by selling about $150 million of nonperforming loans.
On Slide 4. We're making solid progress in strengthening our core businesses and working hard to overcome economic and regulatory headwinds. Our bankers are focused on providing exceptional service, expanding customer relationships and proactively soliciting new business. As a result, we've seen solid market share gains across our footprint. According to recent FDIC data, our deposits in Tennessee increased 6.5% over last year compared to the 2.5% growth rate in the markets we serve. We retained our top ranking in our west and east regions, and we continue to make progress in middle Tennessee. For the second year in a row, we outpaced the market in Nashville as our deposits grew 7.4% and our share increased 30 basis points.
We're also seeing encouraging loan growth trends. To date, our bankers have made almost 40,000 calls on existing and prospective customers. This effort has paid off as period end loans in the regional bank were up 5% from last quarter, driven by loans to mortgage companies, corporate borrowers and asset-based lending. We remain focused on replacing our lower yielding non-strategic loans with better-priced, relationship-oriented assets. Again, our strategy is working.
Despite competitive loan pricing pressures, loan yields and the bank were relatively stable from second to third quarter.
The regional bank posted 2% total revenue growth second to third quarter, driven by higher net interest income and steady fee income. Implementation of the Durbin amendment this month will pressure banking industry fees, and we expect roughly a $20 million impact to annual revenue.
To offset lost revenue, we continue to make pricing adjustments, but we are taking a thoughtful approach to ensure we provide true customer value. For example, beginning later this month, we are initiating a $0.04 charge per PIN debit transaction, $0.14 on signature transactions and capping the monthly fee at a maximum of $3.
Capital markets had a strong quarter with fixed income averaging daily -- with fixed income average daily revenue increasing 28% to $1.4 million in the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our unique business model, which is focused on distribution and not proprietary trading, combined with the depth and diversification of our customer base across the depository and non-depository sectors positioned us well for market conditions.
Productivity and efficiency improvement remains a top priority for us. We made good progress in the third quarter with regional bank expenses down 4% and an improved efficiency ratio of 66% in the bank. However, environmental costs remain elevated as mortgage repurchase provision expense increased from last quarter.
In our core businesses, we are on track with our efficiency initiatives and now expect $124 million in cost savings. We estimate that we realized an annualized $88 million of cost saves in our third quarter run rate.
Our productivity efforts are starting to pay off. For example, revenue per FTE in the regional bank increased 5% from last quarter. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving a 60% to 65% consolidated efficiency ratio.
Turning to credit quality. We were able to accelerate the reduction of our nonperforming loans, selling approximately $150 million in net book value of nonperformers. These NPLs were mostly in our non-strategic permanent mortgage portfolio, and the loss on sale impacted third quarter provision by $36 million.
For the quarter, consolidated provision was $32 million, and total net charge-offs were $106 million. The loan sales impacted third quarter charge-offs, accounting for 45% of total net charge-offs.
To sum up, third quarter results demonstrated that we are continuing to successfully execute, as I said, controlling what we can control, which is resulting in solid core business performance. BJ will now take you through the detailed financial review, and I'll be back with some closing comments. BJ?"
272721,141272076,172961,"First Horizon National Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","First Horizon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Core b",1499,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Slide 6. Net income available to shareholders was $36 million, and earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter's net income of $20 million and EPS of $0.08. Core business net income was $94 million compared to $27 million in the second quarter. While third quarter's bottom line was solid, there were also some significant items. We executed nonperforming loan sales, as Bryan said, approximating $150 million in net book value. Provision impact from loss on these sales was $36 million. We also sold some Visa shares in the third quarter as a -- for a securities gain of $35 million. Expenses related to our restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives were $2 million, down from $17 million in the second quarter; and additionally, a previously announced divestiture resulted in an after-tax gain of about $5 million within discontinued ops.
Moving to Slide 7. Take a look at some segment highlights. Pretax income in the regional bank increased to $94 million from $74 million in the second quarter. We booked a provision credit of $22.7 million compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter, as we saw continued credit improvement in our loan portfolios.
Revenues were up 2%. NII was up primarily from a higher volume of loans to mortgage companies. Fees were stable. Regional bank expenses declined $6 million linked quarter and were down $15 million from third quarter 2010.
In our capital markets segment, pretax income increased to $28 million in the third quarter compared to a pretax loss of $20 million in the second, which included a $36.7 million litigation settlement expense. Fixed income average daily revenues increased to $1.4 million in the third quarter from $1.1 million in the second. Growth in average daily revenues reflects the strength of our extensive distribution network and our substantial penetration of the depository customer segment combined with favorable market conditions.
Following the Fed's early August announcement of an extended low rate -- interest rate environment, we saw our customers begin to deploy a greater amount of their excess liquidity, resulting in increased fixed income buying activity. Since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales and distribution activities on behalf of our clients, we benefit when there is strong buying activity while avoiding significant negative trading results experienced by the firms.
We believe that in the near term, fixed income average daily revenues could stay elevated within this range. However, as always, our performance remains sensitive to interest rate changes and the overall economic environment, among other factors.
In our corporate segment, pretax income was $19 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $27 million in the second. Third quarter included $35 million in securities gains from the sale of Visa stock and lower restructuring expense. 
In the non-strategic segment, pretax income was a loss of $98 million compared to a loss of $13 million in the second quarter. The increased pretax loss was driven by a higher loan loss provision, primarily driven by the loan sales, increased mortgage repurchase provision expense, as well as elevated cost from the transfer to a new sub-servicer and a negative adjustment in our mortgage warehouse valuation.
On Slide 8, we'll take a look at balance sheet and net interest margin trends. Consolidated net interest margin was relatively stable at 3.23% compared to 3.20% in the second quarter. Core business net interest margin was 3.52%. Positive drivers for margin included higher loan volume, lower deposit costs, which were somewhat offset by lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio. Over the next several quarters, we expect to defend the margin by replacing lower yielding non-strategic assets with better priced regional bank assets, further reducing deposit pricing and experiencing less of a drag from nonperformers. However, there's likely to be continued pressure with lower reinvestment yields in the securities portfolio, and margin is likely to decline modestly by a few basis points per quarter over the next several quarters.
As you can see on Slide 9, loan pipeline trends in our regional bank continue to be encouraging as loan commitments and loans funded are up compared to last year. Although borrowers remain cautious, we're seeing areas of demand from customers in our corporate asset-based lending CRE and mortgage warehouse lending segments. With revenue demand, pricing and structure remains competitive. Our loan yields in the regional bank were relatively stable at 4.01% compared to last quarter's yields at 4.02%. Given the competitive environment, we expect yields will be under pressure. Nonetheless, new loans being booked in the regional bank continue to be better priced than regional banking and non-strategic assets that are running off our balance sheet.
Moving to expenses on Slide 10. We were very pleased with our continued progress here. Consolidated expenses declined 6% from last quarter. Regional banking expenses decreased 4% as we continue to implement cost-save initiatives. Productivity and efficiency actions in the third quarter include reductions of FTEs, lower discretionary spending and gaining efficiency from exited businesses. We will continue to evaluate efficiency actions such as consolidating branches and further process improvements, and we should also benefit from technology investments. Over the long term, we continue to target a 25% reduction from the level of 2010 consolidated expenses, mostly by the end of 2013.
Moving on to mortgage repurchase on Slide 11. Linked quarter, mortgage repurchase provision expense increased to $53 million from $25 million. Net realized losses matched provision, leaving reserves flat at $169 million. The rescission rate stayed steady in July and August but trended lower in September, reflecting a higher mix of mortgage insurance-related resolutions, leading to higher loss content.
In the quarter, the GSEs made a push to resolve by September 30 unresolved repurchase claims based on MI coverage loss. To some extent, this accelerated charge-offs and contributed to third quarter's higher level of losses. Our operational pipeline dropped from $451 million to $418 million with new requests of $200 million and resolutions of $237 million. The operational pipeline includes requests where mortgage insurance cancellations are under review. Once this coverage is lost, it comes out of our operational pipeline, but we continue to consider these loans in the reserve calculation.
The GSEs appear to have become more aggressive in their recovery efforts. Quarter-to-quarter, we are likely to see volatility in repurchase expense from the variances in the mix of both inflows and resolutions. Sitting here today, we expect our repurchase inflows to be reasonably steady, resolutions to continue to be strong, and we also still believe we're on the backside of GSE-related repurchase requests.
Moving to Slide 12, a minute on private mortgage securitizations. We still have had no repurchase requests from these securitizations to date. We still currently have 4 lawsuits related to private mortgage securitizations, including the FHFA lawsuit. Our private mortgage securitizations have generally performed favorably overall to the industry cohort benchmarks. As you can see on this slide, 66% of private mortgage securitizations are outperforming industry cohort on cum loss, and 81% of these securitizations are outperforming cohorts on 60-day-plus delinquencies.
Our mix is different. We did no subprime, and additionally, reps and warranties are generally more limited than for GSE whole-loan sales. Considering the differences between the private securitizations and GSE loans that we've outlined on the slide, we continue to believe right now that our private securitization risk is likely to be significantly less than our experience with GSEs, which continues to be manageable as an earnings headwind.
Moving to asset quality on Slide 13. Credit quality metrics continue to be positive. NPAs declined. Net charge-offs, excluding the loan sales, were down. Loan sales of about $150 million and net book value included $126 million from our perm mortgage portfolio and about $24 million from our commercial loan portfolio. UPB on the sold loans was $220 million, reflecting a 47% blended mark on the loan sales. Reserves decreased $74 million, including $12 million associated with the loan sales. Despite several quarters of reserve releases, our reserved to loans remained healthy at $277 million. Given that our credit quality trends are generally favorable, we expect additional reserve releases, but the rate of reserve decrease could slow down depending on the economic environment.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonperforming assets declined 22% linked quarter, primarily due to the loan sales and upgrades in our commercial portfolios. In addition to broad-based improvement in our loan portfolios, we expect that the sale of nonperforming should be favorable to overall credit quality metrics in the future.
Wrapping up on Slide 15. Our core businesses showed good progress in reaching our long-term bonefish targets as we focus on controlling what we can control with solid trends in the regional bank, continued strong performance in our capital markets business and improving productivity and efficiency. Although the non-strategic segment and mortgage repurchase remain a drag, I'm pleased with the momentum in the bank and in our capital markets business. Bryan?"

The latter, the reserve, is harder to pinpoint because you obviously have to look at the mix of resolutions and inflows and all that kind of stuff on a forward-looking basis.

Again, the provision itself will depend on how we look at the reserve and the mix of it, but I would expect that the actual charge-offs may likely come down."

We do think we're on the backside with the GSEs. We're 3 years out from the last loan we originated and sold to the GSEs. The private securitizations for the reasons that BJ described in detail, we feel that the private securitization exposure is likely to be significantly less than the exposure to the GSEs, and we think it is well manageable as an earnings headwind.

I think our bankers, our capital markets teams are executing very well on customer business. So all of that said, we feel like we've got a very strong capital base.

Our losses in August were $13 million, and our losses in September were $29 million. The high watermark for any particular month over the last 18 months had been around $14.8 million or so. So that, coupled with the communication that we did receive from the GSEs that they wanted to resolve certain types of claims by 9/30, leads me to believe that there was certainly an acceleration of our charge-offs. So those are all things that we have contemplated, we have always contemplated in our reserve calculations. So even with a higher level of charge-offs, you didn't necessarily see higher level of reserves for future content based on what we see in the pipeline today, and what I call our operational pipeline continues to go down. So what that means is we have folks literally working on claims. Once MI coverage is actually lost, there's literally nothing else for our folks to work on. So it comes out of our pipeline, but it continues to be accounted for in our reserve. I see that as a positive sign as that at some point, we don't have to work these anymore, and we're just waiting to literally resolve the paperwork on it one way or the other. So I continue to see good progress, good trends, good work from our folks, and as I've said before, I actually believe that the level of charge-offs are likely to be down over the next few quarters."

Number two, we look at our performance versus industry to get a general feel of how we're performing. Third, we did no subprime securitization, and I think if you look at the industry mix, there was 30-plus percent of subprime done during this time period. So all of these things kind of put in a bucket, and the BofA settlement, whether or not it goes through, provided somewhat of a benchmark, if you will. And as we outlined in the second quarter, our delinquencies and defaults relative to that portfolio are significantly better, and so we couple all that GSE stuff, couple anything that we know externally.

If there are -- there are factors that are just going to take a while to work through, and it's not something that's going to be a quick resolution. That said, as you would expect, when we make application to -- or consult with our regulators to manage our capital level, we walk through stress testing the significant risks in the balance sheet. And we lay that out over time, and we lay it out and compared to where our balance sheet is, what our credit quality looks like, what our GSE exposures looks like, what our private label securities potentially exposure looks like, and we put all that together, and we stress our capital. And we put forth a proposal, and the regulators are, they are with the organization and evaluate us on a long-term basis. So it's a process that is sort of all put together. It doesn't -- unfortunately, it doesn't work with a timeline in terms of when the GSEs or when the private label securities might come to a resolution. It's just going to take some time. As we said, we will continue to work on it. And I would add this, that in some sense, time is our friend when it comes to dealing with the GSEs and the private label securities. Every day that goes by, more loans pay down, more loans pay off. The exposure continues to reduce, and as we pointed out a couple of times, we haven't originated or sold any of these loans going back over 3 years and over that period. The last ones originated and sold were August of 2008. Over that period, you've gone through the worst housing crisis in possibly the nation's history, and we've gone through a 25-, 30-year high in unemployment. So it's just going to take some time to work through it. We're trying to be patient and deliver it in the way we do that.

So the way we're doing it is better-yielding assets coming on in the regional bank, replacing lower-yielding assets either in the bank or in our non-strategic. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to bring our deposit costs down marginally, but the reinvestment rates that we're seeing on the portfolio will certainly create a headwind. So the way I see the margin over the next several quarters is us defending flat as well as we can but most likely seeing a few basis points decline per quarter over the next several quarters."

I think with valuations hit as hard as they've been hit over the last 90 days, I don't think it makes a lot of sense in many ways for buyers and maybe for sellers. So I think it will be a little bit slower than it has been or seeming to build. So I think it's going to take a little time. Valuations are going to have to get right. Given the valuations of our currency, I think capital repatriation makes more sense in the short run than M&A, unless it's an extraordinarily attractive financial transaction.
