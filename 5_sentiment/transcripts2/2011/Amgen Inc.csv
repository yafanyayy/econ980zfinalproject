The",348,"Okay, thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2010 results conference call. Unlike most reporting quarters, we are the first to go this year ahead of other Bio Pharma companies. The objective of this call is to review our solid performance last year despite the impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform. We also provide a perspective on a growth healthcare for 2011. 2010 was truly a notable year as we received approval for and launched two very important therapist, Prolia and XGEVA. You'll here more of these launches during the call together with updates on progress we have made towards advancing our pipeline. As we did for the third quarter call, we'll follow a streamlined format for our prepared remarks. I think this formant was well appreciated as we received many favorable comments after our last call. In other words, will focus only on those comments that provides added clarity on issues outlined in our press release. So with that, I would like to introduce our presenters. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, who will lead the discussion by providing a strategic overview of our business, as well as comments on the acquisition of biotech that was announced today. Following Kevin, you'll know from our CFO, Jon Peacock who will highlight key aspects of our financial performance during the quarter, as well as provide guidance for 2011. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Bradway will then give you a high level of summary of our global commercial sales, as well as a report on full year commercialization. Our Head of R&D, Roger Perlmutter will conclude our prepared comments by providing a regulatory and pipeline update. As of the case of such calls, our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. What it states in summary is that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results could vary materially. 
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Before I share my thoughts about our 2010 results and 2011 prospects, I would like to just take a minute to reflect. Each year, any large global company in virtually in this industry faces a number of uncertainties and last year was a specially froth for us as we think about just the year ago. I'm especially proud and pleased to say that Amgen met our challenges successfully and set the stage for promising future. Here are just few of the highlights: Prolia and XGEVA were approved. After 15 years of effort over $1.5 billion of investment and the tireless work uncounted members of our team, we're proud of these results. I think it's biotechnology at its best, and we look forward to helping patients enjoy the benefit of this set of innovations. The bone metastases study we announced the results for the end of last year of so called 147 study added to the benefit of XGEVA. Roger will talk more about our regulatory prospects and plants there, but clearly this is a landmark result, we're proud of that. 
Three, we delivered financially even on the face of tremendous health care reform and reimbursement headwinds around the world. We effectively and thoughtfully represented patient interest in a variety of public government-sponsored reviews of aspects of our ESA franchise that continues this year. We'll talk about in a minute. We advanced our pipeline in many ways. We made significant management changes on naming a new Chief Operating Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. We maintained the highest compliance standards and performance in an increasingly challenging environment. 
And finally, we successfully again represented independent our intellectual property. 2010 was a superb operational year for Amgen, and I want to thank Amgen's staff worldwide for their efforts. It was truly exceptional. Our focus on 2011 is easy to describe, but is always challenging to execute. First, we can take our eyes off and we won't take our eyes off the core business and all of its aspects. The recent med tech discussions made me proud about our work for patients. We need to in well advance Prolia and XGEVA. Prolia is in a promising therapy for osteoporosis that is growing. However, predicting the ramp rate of any new technology in any business is challenging. However, our efforts and enthusiasm both are very high. 
XGEVA is off to a strong start, and we're very optimistic with the 147 study only increasing our confidence. We need to and will advance in enlarge and enrich our pipeline. 
Today's announcement of our Bio mix acquisition is indicative of our objectives. Good company, good science have potential advance for patients with grieveness illness with few good treatment options. We were also thoughtful about using shareholder dollars in this acquisition in balancing risk and reward. By the way, the buybacks acquisition-related costs in 2011 are reflected in our guidance that we'll share in a moment. 
Next, we're going to grow shareholder value by keeping our financial promises, executing a smart strategy well thought for the use of our cash and making our pipeline even stronger. We are hopeful this year as the major overhangs or the mega-overhangs for the past receed, this will be possible. While we will never be about challenges and uncertainties, I'd like our prospects. We look forward to on April 20 in New York City at the business review sharing more with you about our plans and prospects, and we'll reach out soon to large shareholders to be sure we meet your needs and expectations for that meeting. 
John, I'd like to turn it over to you now."

You'll see it in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share up 11%. Let me take you through the highlights and product sales in a few minutes. Other revenues during the quarter, benefited from amount and payment received from Takeda on initiation of AMD 336 Phase 3 trial  for cancer. Operating expenses were 1% lower in the quarter versus a year ago. There were a number of factors contributing to this. 
First, cost of sales were higher than 6%. This is primarily due to inventory write-offs from the Enbrel voluntary recall and some higher bulk material costs our inventory. Research and development costs were 5% lower, primarily due to a licensing prepayments of Array Bio Pharma that we paid in the fourth quarter of last year. SG&A was held broadly in line with 2009. The adjusted tax rate was 15.5% compared to 18.8% for the year. This was due to the full-year benefit of the R&D tax credit that was enacted late in the year and fully recognized in the fourth quarter. The low tax rate that you see the fourth quarter 2009 was due to a change in revenue and expense mix during that quarter. 
Adjusted earning per share $1.17 was up $0.12, helped by share buybacks. in our GAAP earnings, you will see we also took an impairment charge of $118 million related to the transfer of our Freemont manufacturing facility to Baringga, Ingelheim. Bubble [ph] talk more about the operational of the impact of  this transaction.
Turning to the full year on Page 6, total revenues were 3% higher compared to 2009. Other revenues grew 35% primarily due to milestone payments received from GSK for the Prolia approval in Europe and from Takeda for Vectibix approval in Japan. Operating expenses increased to 4% compared to 2009. The main drivers here where cost of sales, which again were up 6% from the year primarily due to higher inventory write-offs from the EPOGEN, Procrit and Enbrel recalls and from some variable material cost. 
SG&A costs were 5% higher due to our investment in Prolia launch during the year and some high litigation cost. Research and development costs were broadly in line with 2009. The adjusted tax rate on the year was 18.8% compared to 16.9% in 2009. Last year's rate benefited from tax settlement that were concluded during the year.  Adjusted earnings per share was $5.21, up $0.30 or up 6%. 
The key balance sheet and cash flow movements are shown on Page 7. Our cash balance increased by $4 billion to $17.4 billion. Our net cash balance increased by $1.5 billion as we issued debt of $2.5 billion during the year in anticipation of paying down a $2.5 billion convertible, which matures in February. In 2011, the acquisition of Bio Vecs that Roger will talk more about will result in the payments of $425 million to buyback shareholders on closing. Further payments of up to $575 million will be made upon the achievement of certain defined regulatory and sales milestones in future years. 
Cash flow from operations was up $5.8 million for the year compared to $6.3 billion in 2009 . This reduction was predominantly due to the timing of U.S. tax payments over the two-year period. Capital expenditures were held at $600 million, slightly above 2009. And finally, the total cost of shares repurchased in 2010 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2009. The benefit of this program can be seen in our adjusted EPS results for the year.
Page 8 provides our guidance for 2011. We expect to deliver revenues of between $15.1  billion and $15.5 billion. Our plan is assumed a Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rates in the low 137, we're not assuming any significant movement from this. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.20. This reflects total U.S. Healthcare Reform cost, which we estimate at $400 million to $500 million in 2011, and that includes the new federal excise fee, which we estimate will be between $150 million and $200 million. This compares to total Healthcare Reform cost in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Our guidance overall reflects our plan to grow adjusted EPS before the impact of the  federal excise fee. 
One other factor in our guidance is our expectation that we will invest more in research and development in 2011. This reflects increased number of Phase 3 program, the BioVecs acquisition that we announced today and the step up in our discovery research investments. This will be partly offset by an expected improvement in cost of sales in 2011. Our 2011 adjusted tax rate, we expect to be between 19% in 20%. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million similar to the last year. 
Now, I'll hand over to Bob to review commercial operations."

Consistent with our third quarter call, the produ",1043,"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the product-by-product details are contained in our appendix in the press release, and I'll not present that material here, but Jim Daly and I are available to answer questions about the product specific slides during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year fourth quarter comparison, our global product sales remained relatively unchanged, which was a function of several offsetting factors. First, in U.S., Enbrel and Prograstin delivered 3% and 4% growth respectively, and globally, our more recently launched product, including Sensivar and Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA grew $82 million or 29%. Dividend sales declined by $112 million or 16% during the quarter. Within the Epogen decline there are several important factors that you have bear in mind. First, it's worth pointing out that roughly half of the sales decline was due to non-demand related items such as changes in wholesaler inventory levels and changes to accounting estimates. The remainder of the sale decline were due to demand, reflecting the decline in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. 
As we shared with you on our third quarter call, we expected to see those decline as providers begin in the fourth quarter to refine their treatment practices ahead of the implementation of the ESRD bundle, which went into effect at the beginning of this year. For the full year, our global product sales grew by $309 million or 2%, which was mainly due to growth from our newer products, which grew by $278 million for the year and from increased Prograstin sales. 
I'll make one final comment in our 2010 performance, which is to note that U.S. Healthcare Reform decreased sales by $65 million for the quarter, and $198 million for the year. Looking ahead to 2011, you just heard John provide revenue guidance. It's important to note that we are anticipating several factors will shape product sales in 2011. We can't further impact the  Aranesp from the ESA REMS, and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. 
With respect to EPOGEN, we expect further moderate dose declines, as providers refine their treatment practices to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. As we've stated before, we believe the ESRD quality improvement program is important in preserving access to important medicines for patients on dialysis and demonstrates a commitment by CMS to these principles. 
Our 2011 guidance assumes a moderate impact on EPOGEN dose front loaded to the first half of the year, and what we are seeing today this consistent with that assumption. Our guidance does not reflect the dramatic change in utilization for EPOGEN or Aranesp as a result of a major revelatory or reimbursement changes. I know there's a great deal of interest in this, and we'll obviously keep you informed on the utilization patterns as the year progresses. 
And finally, for 2011 were excited about the Denosumab opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, I'll speak more about the Prolia and XGEVA launches. We continue to make steady progress of Prolia. Were encouraged by the trajectory particularly that we saw in November and December. And the U.S., we estimate that approximately 9,000 physicians have now ordered or prescribed Prolia, and 40% of these have placed additional orders. Primary care physicians represent about 60% of our total prescribers, and it's worth noting that approximately 2/3 of our targeted rheumatologist have prescribed Prolia at this point. Both specialist and primary care physicians are predominantly using “buy and bill” fulfillment, provide a Prolia with low patient out-of-pocket costs. We expect that the primary care prescribing base will expand as the various prescription drug plans announced their Medicare Part D coverage for Prolia, and we expect this to happen -- to be announced in the first quarter and to be implemented in the second quarter of this year. 
Outside of the U.S., we launched and secured full reimbursement in nine countries in 2010, including the U.K. and Australia, which are known for their rigorous reimbursement policies. In 2011, we expect an additional 19 launches to provide growth outside of the U.S. 
Turning to XGEVA, we're excited about the opportunity this important medicine provides for patients, and we're seeing usage both from oncologist and urologist and we're encouraged by the early signs from the launch. As you know, however, we had only a few days in which to promote the product in 2010, so naturally, we'll have more say about this in April with our first quarter results.
Turning now to Slide 12. This slide displays our actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs in blue are largely a result of wholesale inventory buildup on depletion not fluctuations and actual patient utilization. The red lines indicate average weekly sales, and these lines exclude returns or discount accrual true ups as well as affect of wholesaler inventory fluctuations which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. The drop in weekly average sales for Aranesp from 2009 to 2010, as I'm sure you're all aware, is due primarily to the decline in the overall ESA segment, reflecting more conservative use of ESA on both ontology and Nephrology. As you can see the the average weekly sales for Aranesp stabilized in the sequential quarters of 2010 as the impact from the sort of use of ESAs was  fully incorporated in the treatment practices. However, we can't rule out a further decline in the Aranesp sales going forward as a result of the Aranesp rollout or for many major new regulatory reimbursement changes. 
Finally, to comment on manufacturing, we announced earlier this month that we entered into a transaction with Ingelheim, in which they acquired our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. This move is consistent with our offstated desire to optimize our manufacturing supply chain and to improve our efficiencies the supplier medicines of patients. This move is made possible by productivity improvements across the  rest of the networks. 
With that I'll turn it over to Roger, who will talk about research and development progress in the quarter."

Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. T",890,"Thanks, Bob. Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. This approval was based on three large randomized blinded active comparator, controlled studies that showed that XGEVA, administered once monthly via subcutaneous injection was superior to the standard of care, Zometa, in reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases that can be very aggressive prostate cancer, and was not anterior in reducing the frequency of these events in patients with other  solid tumors, but with multiple myeloma. 
XGEVA was approved by the FDA on a priority review basis, just six months after filing. The XGEVA file was also under review by the European Medicines Agency and then other jurisdics worldwide follow these reviews are proceeding appropriately. In December, we also obtained topline results from our 147 study, which asked whether administration of XGEVA reduce the risk of skeletal metastases in patients with prostate cancer who have high-risk of sustaining the first metastases to the bone. The successful completion of this study provides for the first time to my knowledge, clinical evidence supporting the view that tumors must activate the RANK Ligand access to optimally penetrate bone.
There's a big deal to learn about the results of the 147 study. However, a more detailed analysis, which include a variety of sensitivity studies confirms and extends what we have seen in the top line data summary that we disclosed last month. We will meet with the FDA to discuss this study in the very near future. In the present, expect to file for approval of this new indication in the first half of 2011. Of course, we're continuing to study a variety of other settings, both in patients with cancer and in those with other forms of bone loss. I'll have more detail about these studies during future earnings calls. During the fourth quarter, we also completed our filing for Vectibix and achievement of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other chemo therapeutic agents in the first and second line setting. These filing include specific reference to the importance of limiting therapy to those patients whose tumors contain only wild type that is unmutated versus the of the KRAS gene, and time to permit simultaneous filing of a diagnostic tests from mutation in KRAS, which we completed with our partner Kyogen. The data from our filings are already under review in other jurisdictions. 
Also noted on Slide 14 we have revised our view of the timing of completion of the Sensipar EVOLVE study based on additional scrutiny of event rate data. You'll recall that the EVOLVE study asseses long term Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were treated with Sensipar for the impairment in Europe as compared to those receiving placebo. Extrapolation of the current event rate for this  fully enrolled file indicates that we will not achieve a sufficient events until 2012. 
As shown on Slide 15, we also made substantial progress in the fourth quarter with respect to the advancement of our mid-stage pipeline. We enrolled the first patient in our Phase 3 study of AMD 386, Angio antagonist antibody for the treatment of advanced cancer. Promising Phase II data in the same setting were discussed at American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last June. We also began initiating sites for our Phase 3 study of AMD 479 and INGF1 receptor antagonist antibody used in combination with in the setting of pancreatic cancer.  Phase II data for this program were also presented in last year. 
Also on Slide 15, I'll note that we now expect to complete the Phase 3 MONET-1 study for the first half of this year. You'll recall that this study ask whether the daily treatment with Moltasanib, an oral multi kynese inhibitor improves overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer for simultaneously receiving and therapies. 
Lastly, on Slide 16. Today we announced that we have reached the definitive agreement to acquire BioVec, a small privately held company based in Wilborn, Massachusetts. For more than a decade, BioVec has pursue the development of a cytolytic live virus vaccine called Oncovex GM CSF.  Based on the molecular modification of the proprietary strain of herpes simplex virus type one. The virus has been engineered to permit relatively selective replication in the cancer cell, and has also been modified to defete a crucial mechanism that herpese simplex virus uses to evade immune detection. In this change, coupled with the expression of the embedded GSM CSF improves immune recognition of tumor cells in and around the site of virus injection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that injection of this virus into the tumors causes direct tumors cell lices and also stimulates immune distraction of distant tumor cells. These observations was led to the initiation of two Phase 3 studies, both under special protocol assessment with the FDA. One in patients with malignant melanoma and the second in patients with head and neck cancer. The melanoma study in particular is more than 90% enrolled. 
I will have a great deal more to say about this program and about many of our other programs during our business review meeting in April. Kevin?"

Before I share my thoughts about our 2010 results and 2011 prospects, I'd like to just take a minute to reflect. Each year, any large global company, in virtually any industry, faces a number of uncertainties and last year was a specially froth for us as we think about just the year ago. I'm especially proud and pleased to say that Amgen met our challenges successfully and set the stage for promising future. Here are just few of the highlights: Prolia and XGEVA were approved. After 15 years of effort over $1.5 billion of investment and the tireless work of uncounted members of our team, we're proud of these result. I think it's biotechnology at its best, and we look forward to helping patients enjoy the benefit of this set of innovations. The bone mass prevention study we announced the results of toward the end of last year, or so called 147 study, added to the benefit of XGEVA. Roger will talk more about our regulatory prospects and plans there, but clearly, this is a landmark result, we're proud of it. 
Three, we delivered financially even on the face of tremendous health care reform and reimbursement headwinds around the world. We effectively and thoughtfully represented patient interest at a variety of public government-sponsored reviews of aspects of our ESA franchise, that continues this year, we'll talk about in a minute. We advanced our pipeline in many ways. We made significant management changes on naming a new Chief Operating Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. We maintained the highest compliance standards and performance in an increasingly challenging environment. 
And finally, we successfully again represented and defended our intellectual property. 2010 was a superb operational year for Amgen, and I want to thank Amgen's staff worldwide for their efforts. It was truly exceptional. Our focus on 2011 is easy to describe, but as always, challenging to execute. First, we can't take our eyes off and we won't take our eyes off the core business in all of its aspects. The recent MEDCAC discussions made me proud about our work for patients. We need to and will advance Prolia and XGEVA. Prolia is in a promising therapy for osteoporosis that is growing. However, predicting the ramp rate of any new technology in any business is challenging. However, our efforts and enthusiasm both are very high. 
XGEVA is off to a strong start, and we're very optimistic with the 147 study, only increasing our confidence. We need to and will advance, enlarge and enrich our pipeline. 
Today's announcement of our BioVex acquisition is indicative of our objectives. Good company, good science have potential advance for patients with grievous illness with few good treatment options. We were also thoughtful about using shareholder dollars in this acquisition and balancing risk and reward. By the way, the buybacks acquisition-related costs in 2011 are reflected in our guidance that we'll share in a moment. 
Next, we're going to grow shareholder value by keeping our financial promises, executing a smart strategy well, thought for use of our cash and making our pipeline even stronger. We are hopeful this year as the major overhangs or the mega-overhangs of the past reseed, this will be possible. While we will never be without challenges and uncertainties, I like our prospects. We look forward to on April 21 in New York City at a business review, sharing more with you about our plans and prospects, and we'll reach out soon to large shareholders to be sure we meet your needs and expectations for that meeting. 
Jon, I'd like to turn it over to you now."
24816,116155760,94539,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin.

Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. We'll take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minutes. 
Other revenues during the quarter, benefited from amounts and payment received from Takeda on initiation of AMG 386 Phase 3 trial  for ovarian cancer. Operating expenses were 1% lower in the quarter versus a year ago. There were a number of factors contributing to this: First, cost of sales were higher by 6%. This was primarily due to inventory write-offs from the Enbrel voluntary recall and some higher bulk material costs  flowing through inventory. Research and development costs were 5% lower, primarily due to a licensing fee payments to Array BioPharma that we paid in the fourth quarter of last year. SG&A was held broadly in line with 2009. 
The adjusted tax rate was 15.5% compared to 18.8% for the year. This was due to the full-year benefit of the R&D tax credit that was enacted late in the year and fully recognized in the fourth quarter. The low tax rate that you see in the fourth quarter 2009 was due to a change in revenue and expense mix during that quarter. 
Adjusted earning per share $1.17 was up $0.12, helped by share buybacks. In our GAAP earnings, you'll see we also took an impairment charge of $118 million, related to the transfer of our Fremont manufacturing facility to Boehringer Ingelheim. Bob will talk more about the operational impact of this transaction.
Turning to the full year on Page 6, total revenues were 3% higher compared to 2009. Other revenues grew 35% primarily, due to milestone payments received from GSK for the Prolia approval in Europe and from Takeda for Vectibix approval in Japan. Operating expenses increased to 4% compared to 2009. The main drivers here where cost of sales, which again were up 6% from the year, primarily due to higher inventory write-offs from the EPOGEN, PROCRIT and Enbrel recalls and from some higher bulk-material costs. 
SG&A costs were 5% higher due to our investment in Prolia launches during the year and some high litigation costs. Research and development costs were broadly in line with 2009. The adjusted tax rate on the year was 18.8% compared to 16.9% in 2009. Last year's rate benefited from tax settlement that were concluded during the year.  Adjusted earnings per share was $5.21, up $0.30 or up 6%. 
The key balance sheet and cash flow movements are shown on Page 7. Our cash balance increased by $4 billion to $17.4 billion. Our net cash balance increased by $1.5 billion as we issued debt of $2.5 billion during the year, in anticipation of paying down a $2.5 billion convertible, which matures in February. In 2011, the acquisition of BioVex that Roger will talk more about, will result in payments of $425 million to buyback shareholders on closing. Further payments of up to $575 million will be made upon the achievement of certain-defined regulatory and sales milestones in future years. 
Cash flow from operations was $5.8 billion for the year compared to $6.3 billion in 2009 . This reduction was predominantly due to the timing of U.S. tax payments over the two-year period. Capital expenditures were held at $600 million, slightly above 2009. And finally, the total cost of shares repurchased in 2010 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2009. The benefit of this program can be seen in our adjusted EPS results for the year.
Page 8 provides our guidance for 2011. We expect to deliver revenues of between $15.1 billion and $15.5 billion. Our plan is assumed a Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the low 130, and we're not assuming any significant movement from this. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.20, this reflects total U.S. Healthcare Reform costs, which we estimate at $400 million to $500 million in 2011, and that includes the new federal excise fee, which we estimate will be between $150 million and $200 million. This compares to total Healthcare Reform costs in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Our guidance overall reflects a plan to grow adjusted EPS before the impact of the federal excise fee. 
One other factor in our guidance is an expectation that we will invest more in research and development in 2011. This reflects an increased number of Phase 3 programs, the BioVex acquisition that we announced today and the step up in our discovery research investments. This will be partly offset by an expected improvement in cost of sales in 2011. Our 2011 adjusted tax rate, we expect to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million similar to the last year. 
And so now, I'll hand it over to Bob to review commercial operations."

Consistent with our third quarter call, the p",1046,"Okay. Thank you, Jon. I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the product-by-product details are contained in our appendix in the press release, and I'll not present that material here, but Jim Daly and I are available to answer questions about the product specific slides during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year fourth quarter comparison, our global product sales remained relatively unchanged, which was a function of several offsetting factors. First, in U.S., Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered 3% and 4% growth respectively, and globally, our more recently launched products, including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA grew $82 million or 29%. EPOGEN sales declined by $112 million or 16% during the quarter. Within the EPOGEN decline, there are several important factors however to bear in mind. First, it's worth pointing out that roughly half of the sales decline was due to the non-demand related items such as changes in wholesaler inventory levels and changes to accounting estimates. The remainder of the sales decline was due to demand, reflecting the decline in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. 
As we shared with you on our third quarter call, we expected to see these dose decline as providers begin in the fourth quarter to refine their treatment practices ahead of the implementation of the ESRD bundle, which went into effect at the beginning of this year. For the full year, our global product sales grew by $309 million or 2%, which was mainly due to growth from our newer products, which grew by $278 million for the year and from increased Filgrastim sales. 
I'll make one final comment on our 2010 performance, which is to note that U.S. Healthcare Reform decreased sales by $65 million for the quarter, and $198 million for the year. Looking ahead to 2011, you've just heard Jon provide revenue guidance. It's important to note that we're anticipating several factors will shape product sales in 2011. We can't rule out further impact to Aranesp from the ESA REMS, and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. 
With respect to EPOGEN, we expect further moderate dose declines, as providers refine their treatment practices to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. As we've stated before, we believe the ESRD quality improvement program is important in preserving access to important medicines for patients on dialysis and demonstrates a commitment by CMS to these principles. 
Our 2011 guidance assumes a moderate impact on EPOGEN dose, front loaded to the first half of the year, and what we are seeing today is consistent with that assumption. Our guidance does not reflect the dramatic change in utilization for EPOGEN or Aranesp as a result of any major new regulatory or reimbursement changes. I know there's a great deal of interest in this, and we'll obviously keep you informed on utilization patterns as the year progresses. 
And finally for 2011, were excited about the Denosumab opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, I'll speak more about the Prolia and XGEVA launches. We continue to make steady progress with Prolia, and we're encouraged by the trajectory, particularly that we saw in November and December. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 9,000 physicians have now ordered or prescribed Prolia, and 40% of these have placed additional orders. Primary care physicians represent about 60% of our total prescribers, and it's worth noting that approximately 2/3 of our targeted rheumatologists have prescribed Prolia at this point. 
Both specialist and primary care physicians are predominantly using “buy and bill” fulfillment to provide Prolia with low patient out-of-pocket costs. We expect that the primary care prescribing base will expand as various prescription drug plans announce their Medicare Part D coverage for Prolia, and we expect this to happen -- to be announced in the first quarter and to be implemented in the second quarter of this year. 
Outside of the U.S., we launched and secured full reimbursement in nine countries in 2010, including the U.K. and Australia, which are known for their rigorous reimbursement policies. In 2011, we expect an additional 19 launches to provide growth outside of the U.S. 
Turning to XGEVA, we're excited about the opportunity this important medicine provides for patients, and we're seeing usage come both from oncologists and urologists and we're encouraged by the early signs from the launch. As you know however, we had only a few days in which to promote the product in 2010, so naturally, we'll have more say about this in April with our first quarter results.
Turning now to Slide 12. This slide displays our actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs in blue are largely a result of wholesaler inventory buildup in depletion not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red lines indicate average weekly sales, and these lines exclude returns or discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. The drop in weekly average sales for Aranesp from 2009 to 2010, as I'm sure you're all aware, is due primarily to a decline in the overall ESA segment, reflecting more conservative use of ESAs on both ontology and Nephrology. As you can see, the average weekly sales for Aranesp stabilized in the sequential quarters of 2010, as the impact conservative use of ESAs was fully incorporated in the treatment practices. However, we can't rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales going forward as a result of the REMS rollout or from any major new regulatory reimbursement changes. 
Finally, to comment on manufacturing, we announced earlier this month that we had entered into a transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim, through which they have acquired our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. This move is consistent with our off-stated desire to optimize our manufacturing supply chain and to improve our efficient and safe the supply of medicines for patients. This move is made possible by productivity improvements across the  rest of our network. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, who'll talk about research and development progress in the quarter."

Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. T",898,"Thanks, Bob. Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. This approval was based on three large randomized blinded active comparator controlled studies, that showed that XGEVA, administered once monthly by subcutaneous injection was superior to the then standard of care, Zometa, in reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases, secondary breast and prostate cancer, and was not inferior in reducing the frequency of these events in patients with other  solid tumors, but with multiple myeloma. 
XGEVA was approved by the FDA on a priority review basis, just six months after filing. The XGEVA file was also under review by the European Medicines Agency and in other jurisdictions worldwide, all of these reviews are proceeding appropriately. In December, we also obtained the topline results from our 147 study, which asked whether administration of XGEVA reduce the risk of skeletal metastases in patients with prostate cancer who are at high-risk of sustaining a first metastases to bone. The successful completion of this study provides for the first time to my knowledge, clinical evidence supporting the view that tumors must activate the RANK Ligand access to optimally penetrate bone. 
There's still a great deal to learn about the results of the 147 study. However, our more detailed analysis, which includes a variety of sensitivity studies confirms and extends what we had seen in the top line data summary that we disclosed last month. We will meet with the FDA to discuss this study in the very near future, in the present, expect to file for approval of this new indication in the first half of 2011. Of course, we're continuing to study Denosumabat variety of other settings, both in patients with cancer and in those with other forms of bone loss. I'll have more to say about these studies during future earnings calls. 
During the fourth quarter, we also completed our filing for Vectibix and the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, in combination with other chemo therapeutic agents in the first and second line setting. These filings include specific reference to the importance of limiting therapy to those patients whose tumors contain only wild type that is un-mutated, versus the of the KRAS gene, and were timed to permit simultaneous filing of a diagnostic tests for mutations in KRAS, which we completed with our partner Kyogen. The data from our filings are already under review in other jurisdictions. 
Also noted on Slide 14, we have revised our view of the timing of completion of the Sensipar EVOLVE study based on additional scrutiny of event rate data. You'll recall that the EVOLVE study assesses long term Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are treated with Sensipar for the impairment in Europe as compared to those receiving placebo. Extrapolation of the current event rate for this fully-enrolled trial indicates that we will not achieve a sufficient number of events until 2012. 
As shown on Slide 15, we also made substantial progress in the fourth quarter with respect to the advancement of our mid-stage pipeline. We enrolled the first patients in our Phase 3 study of AMG 386, an angiopoietin antagonist peptibody for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Promising Phase II data in the same setting were discussed at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last June. We also began initiating sites for our Phase 3 study of AMG 479 and IGF-1 receptor antagonist antibody, used in combination with gemcitabine, in the setting of pancreatic cancer.  Phase II data for this program were also presented in ASCO last year. 
Also on Slide 15, I note that we now expect to complete the Phase 3 MONET-1 study in the first half of this year. You'll recall, this study asks whether daily treatment with Motesanib, an oral multi-kinase  inhibitor improves overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who are simultaneously receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin therapies. 
Lastly, on Slide 16. Today we announced that we have reached the definitive agreement to acquire BioVex, a small privately held company based in Woburn, Massachusetts. For more than a decade, BioVex has pursued the development of a cytolytic live virus vaccine called OncoVEX GM-CSF. Based on molecular modification of a proprietary strain of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1. The virus has been engineered to permit relatively selective replication in cancer cell, and has also been modified to defeat a crucial mechanism that Herpes Simplex Virus uses to evade immune detection. 
In this change, coupled with the expression of an embedded GM-CSF cassette, improves immune recognition of tumor cells in and around the site of virus injection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that injection of this virus into tumors causes direct tumor cell lices, and to also stimulate immune distraction of distant tumor cells. These observations led to the initiation of two Phase 3 studies, both under special protocol assessment with the FDA. One in patients with malignant melanoma and the second, in patients with head and neck cancer. The melanoma study in particular is more than 90% enrolled. 
I will have a great deal more to say about this program and about many of our other programs during our business review meeting in April. Kevin?"

And two, It looks like 2011 may be the first year, and maybe last five or six, that Amgen's actually increasing spending. Can someone talk about broadly your thoughts on R&D investment relative to other things you can do with cash?"

And you're right from an intellectual and factual point of view. First of all, highest level. We have a belief that if you don't invest enough money in R&D, you can't succeed in this business. We'd also say that simply investing money in R&D doesn't guarantee anything either, but not investing enough will put you in a bad spot. So that's first. Second, we have had a very productive over the last 10 years. Research and development function, anyway that we want to measure it, numbers of products, innovation, number of molecules, advancing into human subjects. We also noticed that after we had the challenges of 2007 and the ESA, we've tended to leave the Discover Research area a bit less well-funded than we otherwise would have, given the amount of money that went into clinical trials. And Roger and I both believe that we need to make a meaningful increase in Discover Research. It's not the major part of the R&D line items, so irrelatively small amount of money can make a big difference. So we're absolutely committed to innovation, and R&D is the heart of the company, and we're going to continue making strong investment.
Roger, you're the guy who's going to spend it, that was just the banker's view."

Eric, an important thing to remember is that we've had some pretty large Phase III studies that have delivered important results, but those studies don't immediately go to zero, they're open-label extension's associated with these studies. They're large pharmaco business programs. So we are continuing to support those products, for which we've already gained registration, but we're also advancing in a number of really important Phase III  programs, new molecules that I highlighted a little bit on the call, and we'll talk about more in April. So that adds quite a lot to the expense, we think it's extremely well justified. We're doing the right thing in terms of trying to really make meaningful impact on patients who suffer from grievous illness. And as Kevin mentioned, it's important to make sure that Discovery and Research is adequately funded, so that we'll be in a position to pursue a next set of important clinical trials in years down the road. So that's where we stand, there is a significant increase this year. We're pleased to be able to do it and we think we can really, really use that investment."

And in that population, we've already demonstrated that we can dramatically reduce these skeletal-related events, and there's already an indication for that. So the sense is that the 147 data, and again, it must be reviewed by the agency, will simply expand the group of patients for whom XGEVA is an appropriate therapy.

Before I share my thoughts about our 2010 results and 2011 prospects, I'd like to just take a minute to reflect. Each year, any large global company in virtually any industry faces a number of uncertainties and last year was especially fraught for us as we think about just ae year ago. I'm especially proud and pleased to say that Amgen met our challenges successfully and set the stage for a promising future. Here are just few of the highlights: Prolia and XGEVA were approved after 15 years of effort, over $1.5 billion of investment and the tireless work of uncounted members of our team. We're proud of these result. I think it's biotechnology at its best, and we look forward to helping patients enjoy the benefit of this set of innovations. The bone mass prevention study we announced the results of toward the end of last year, or so called 147 study, added to the benefit of XGEVA. Roger will talk more about our regulatory prospects and plans there, but clearly, this is a landmark result.  We're proud of it. 
Three, we delivered financially even in the face of tremendous health care reform and reimbursement headwinds around the world. We effectively and thoughtfully represented patient interest at a variety of public government-sponsored reviews of aspects of our ESA franchise. That continues this year, as we'll talk about in a minute. We advanced our pipeline in many ways. We made significant management changes in naming a new Chief Operating Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. We maintained the highest compliance standards and performance in an increasingly challenging environment. 
And finally, we successfully again represented and defended our intellectual property. 2010 was a superb operational year for Amgen, and I want to thank Amgen's staff worldwide for their efforts. It was truly exceptional. Our focus on 2011 is easy to describe, but as always, challenging to execute. First, we can't take our eyes off and we won't take our eyes off the core business in all of its aspects. The recent MEDCAC discussions made me proud of our work for patients. We need to and will advance Prolia and XGEVA. Prolia is a promising therapy for osteoporosis that is growing. However, predicting the ramp rate of any new technology in any business is challenging. However, our efforts and enthusiasm both are very high. 
XGEVA is off to a strong start, and we're very optimistic with the 147 study, only increasing our confidence. We need to and will advance, enlarge and enrich our pipeline. 
Today's announcement of our BioVex acquisition is indicative of our objectives. Good company, good science have potential advance for patients with grievous illness with few good treatment options. We were also thoughtful about using shareholder dollars in this acquisition and balancing risk and reward. By the way, the buybacks acquisition-related costs in 2011 are reflected in our guidance that we'll share in a moment. 
Next, we're going to grow shareholder value by keeping our financial promises, executing a smart strategy well, thoughtful use of our cash and making our pipeline even stronger. We are hopeful this year as the major overhangs or the mega-overhangs of the past recede, this will be possible. While we will never be without challenges and uncertainties, I like our prospects. We look forward to on April 21 in New York City at a business review, sharing more with you about our plans and prospects, and we'll reach out soon to large shareholders to be sure we meet your needs and expectations for that meeting. 
Jon, I'd like to turn it over to you now."
24816,116155760,94545,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. We'll take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minu",820,"Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. We'll take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minutes. 
Other revenues during the quarter benefited from a milestone payment received from Takeda on initiation of AMG 386 Phase 3 trial  for ovarian cancer. Operating expenses were 1% lower in the quarter versus a year ago. There were a number of factors contributing to this: First, cost of sales were higher by 6%. This was primarily due to inventory write-offs from the Enbrel voluntary recall and some higher bulk material costs  flowing through inventory. Research and development costs were 5% lower, primarily due to licensing fee payments to Array BioPharma that we paid in the fourth quarter of last year. SG&A was held broadly in line with 2009. 
The adjusted tax rate was 15.5% compared to 18.8% for the year. This was due to the full-year benefit of the R&D tax credit that was enacted late in the year and fully recognized in the fourth quarter. The low tax rate that you see in the fourth quarter 2009 was due to a change in revenue and expense mix during that quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share $1.17 was up $0.12, helped by share buybacks. In our GAAP earnings, you'll see we also took an impairment charge of $118 million, related to the transfer of our Fremont manufacturing facility to Boehringer Ingelheim. Bob will talk more about the operational impact of this transaction.
Turning to the full year on Page 6, total revenues were 3% higher compared to 2009. Other revenues grew 35% primarily, due to milestone payments received from GSK for the Prolia approval in Europe and from Takeda for Vectibix approval in Japan. Operating expenses increased 4% compared to 2009. The main drivers here were cost of sales, which again were up 6% from the year, primarily due to higher inventory write-offs from the EPOGEN, PROCRIT and Enbrel recalls and from some higher bulk-material costs. 
SG&A costs were 5% higher due to our investment in the Prolia launch during the year and some high litigation costs. Research and development costs were broadly in line with 2009. The adjusted tax rate on the year was 18.8% compared to 16.9% in 2009. Last year's rate benefited from tax settlement that were concluded during the year.  Adjusted earnings per share was $5.21, up $0.30 or up 6%. 
The key balance sheet and cash flow movements are shown on Page 7. Our cash balance increased by $4 billion to $17.4 billion. Our net cash balance increased by $1.5 billion as we issued debt of $2.5 billion during the year, in anticipation of paying down a $2.5 billion convertible, which matures in February. In 2011, the acquisition of BioVex that Roger will talk more about, will result in a payment of $425 million to buyback shareholders on closing. Further payments of up to $575 million will be made upon the achievement of certain defined regulatory and sales milestones in future years. 
Cash flow from operations was $5.8 billion for the year compared to $6.3 billion in 2009 . This reduction was predominantly due to the timing of U.S. tax payments over the two-year period. Capital expenditures were held at $600 million, slightly above 2009. And finally, the total cost of shares repurchased in 2010 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2009. The benefit of this program can be seen in our adjusted EPS results for the year.
Page 8 provides our guidance for 2011. We expect to deliver revenues of between $15.1 billion and $15.5 billion. Our plan is assumed a Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the low 130s, and we're not assuming any significant movement from this. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.20. This reflects total U.S. Healthcare Reform costs, which we estimate at $400 million to $500 million in 2011, and that includes the new federal excise fee, which we estimate will be between $150 million and $200 million. This compares to total Healthcare Reform costs in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Our guidance overall reflects a plan to grow adjusted EPS before the impact of the federal excise fee. 
One other factor in our guidance is an expectation that we will invest more in research and development in 2011. This reflects an increased number of Phase 3 programs, the BioVex acquisition that we announced today and a step up in our discovery research investments. This will be partly offset by an expected improvement in cost of sales in 2011. Our 2011 adjusted tax rate, we expect to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million similar to the last year. 
And so now, I'll hand it over to Bob to review commercial operations."

I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the p",1048,"Okay. Thank you, Jon. I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the product-by-product details are contained in our appendix in the press release, and I'll not present that material here, but Jim Daly and I are available to answer questions about the product specific slides during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year fourth quarter comparison, our global product sales remained relatively unchanged, which was a function of several offsetting factors. First, in U.S., Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered 3% and 4% growth respectively, and globally, our more recently launched products, including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA grew $82 million or 29%. EPOGEN sales declined by $112 million or 16% during the quarter. Within the EPOGEN decline, there are several important factors however to bear in mind. First, it's worth pointing out that roughly half of the sales decline was due to the non-demand related items such as changes in wholesaler inventory levels and changes to accounting estimates. The remainder of the sales decline was due to demand, reflecting the decline in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. 
As we shared with you on our third quarter call, we expected to see this dose decline as providers began in the fourth quarter to refine their treatment practices ahead of the implementation of the ESRD bundle, which went into effect at the beginning of this year. For the full year, our global product sales grew by $309 million or 2%, which was mainly due to growth from our newer products, which grew by $278 million for the year and from increased Filgrastim sales. 
I'll make one final comment on our 2010 performance, which is to note that U.S. Healthcare Reform decreased sales by $65 million for the quarter, and $198 million for the year. Looking ahead to 2011, you've just heard Jon provide revenue guidance. It's important to note that we're anticipating several factors will shape product sales in 2011. We can't rule out further impact to Aranesp from the ESA REMS, and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. 
With respect to EPOGEN, we expect further moderate dose declines, as providers refine their treatment practices to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. As we've stated before, we believe the ESRD quality improvement program is important in preserving access to important medicines for patients on dialysis and demonstrates a commitment by CMS to these principles. 
Our 2011 guidance assumes a moderate impact on EPOGEN dose, front loaded to the first half of the year, and what we are seeing today is consistent with that assumption. Our guidance does not reflect the dramatic change in utilization for EPOGEN or Aranesp as a result of any major new regulatory or reimbursement changes. I know there's a great deal of interest in this, and we'll obviously keep you informed on utilization patterns as the year progresses. 
And finally for 2011, were excited about the Denosumab opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, I'll speak more about the Prolia and XGEVA launches. We continue to make steady progress with Prolia, and we're encouraged by the trajectory, particularly that we saw in November and December. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 9,000 physicians have now ordered or prescribed Prolia, and 40% of these have placed additional orders. Primary care physicians represent about 60% of our total prescribers, and it's worth noting that approximately 2/3 of our targeted rheumatologists have prescribed Prolia at this point. 
Both specialist and primary care physicians are predominantly using “buy and bill” fulfillment to provide Prolia with low patient out-of-pocket costs. We expect that the primary care prescribing base will expand as various prescription drug plans announce their Medicare Part D coverage for Prolia, and we expect this to happen -- to be announced in the first quarter and to be implemented in the second quarter of this year. 
Outside of the U.S., we launched and secured full reimbursement in nine countries in 2010, including the U.K. and Australia, which are known for their rigorous reimbursement policies. In 2011, we expect an additional 19 launches to provide growth outside of the U.S. 
Turning to XGEVA, we're excited about the opportunity this important medicine provides for patients, and we're seeing usage come both from oncologists and urologists and we're encouraged by the early signs from the launch. As you know however, we had only a few days in which to promote the product in 2010, so naturally, we'll have more to say about this in April with our first quarter results.
Turning now to Slide 12. This slide displays our actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs in blue are largely a result of wholesaler inventory buildup in depletion not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red lines indicate average weekly sales, and these lines exclude returns or discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. The drop in weekly average sales for Aranesp from 2009 to 2010, as I'm sure you're all aware, is due primarily to a decline in the overall ESA segment, reflecting more conservative use of ESAs in both ontology and Nephrology. As you can see, the average weekly sales for Aranesp stabilized in the sequential quarters of 2010, as the impact from the more conservative use of ESAs was fully incorporated into treatment practices. However, we can't rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales going forward as a result of the REMS rollout or from any major new regulatory reimbursement changes. 
Finally, to comment on manufacturing, we announced earlier this month that we had entered into a transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim, through which they have acquired our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. This move is consistent with our off-stated desire to optimize our manufacturing supply chain and to improve our efficient and safe supply of medicines for patients. This move is made possible by productivity improvements across the  rest of our network. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, who'll talk about research and development progress in the quarter."

Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. T",894,"Thanks, Bob. Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. This approval was based on three large randomized blinded active comparator controlled studies, that showed that XGEVA, administered once monthly by subcutaneous injection was superior to the then standard of care, Zometa, in reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases, secondary breast and prostate cancer, and was not inferior in reducing the frequency of these events in patients with other  solid tumors, but with multiple myeloma. 
XGEVA was approved by the FDA on a priority review basis, just six months after filing. The XGEVA file is also under review by the European Medicines Agency and in other jurisdictions worldwide. All of these reviews are proceeding appropriately. In December, we also obtained topline results from our 147 study, which asked whether administration of XGEVA reduced the risk of skeletal metastases in patients with prostate cancer who are at high-risk of sustaining a first metastasis to bone. The successful completion of this study provides for the first time to my knowledge, clinical evidence supporting the view that tumors must activate the RANK Ligand access to optimally penetrate bone. 
There's still a great deal to learn about the results of the 147 study. However, our more detailed analysis, which includes a variety of sensitivity studies, confirms and extends what we have seen in the top line data summary that we disclosed last month. We will meet with the FDA to discuss this study in the very near future, and at present, expect to file for approval of this new indication in the first half of 2011. Of course, we're continuing to study Denosumabin variety of other settings, both in patients with cancer and in those with other forms of bone loss. I'll have more to say about these studies during future earnings calls. 
During the fourth quarter, we also completed our filing for Vectibix in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, in combination with other chemo therapeutic agents in the first and second line setting. These filings include specific reference to the importance of limiting therapy to those patients whose tumors contain only wild type, that is un-mutated, versions the of the KRAS gene, and were timed to permit simultaneous filing of a diagnostic tests for mutations in KRAS, which we completed with our partner Kyogen. The data from our filings are already under review in other jurisdictions. 
Also noted on Slide 14, we have revised our view of the timing of completion of the Sensipar EVOLVE study based on additional scrutiny of event rate data. You'll recall that the EVOLVE study assesses long term Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are treated with Sensipar from Mimpara in Europe as compared to those receiving placebo. Extrapolation of the current event rate for this fully-enrolled trial indicates that we will not achieve a sufficient number of events until 2012. 
As shown on Slide 15, we also made substantial progress in the fourth quarter with respect to the advancement of our mid-stage pipeline. We enrolled the first patients in our Phase 3 study of AMG 386, an angiopoietin antagonist peptibody for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Promising Phase II data in the same setting were discussed at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last June. We also began initiating sites for our Phase 3 study of AMG 479 and IGF-1 receptor antagonist antibody, used in combination with gemcitabine, in the setting of pancreatic cancer.  Phase II data for this program were also presented at ASCO last year. 
Also on Slide 15, I note that we now expect to complete the Phase 3 MONET-1 study in the first half of this year. You'll recall, this study asks whether daily treatment with Motesanib, an oral multi-kinase  inhibitor, improves overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who are simultaneously receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin therapies. 
Lastly, on Slide 16. Today we announced that we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire BioVex, a small privately held company based in Woburn, Massachusetts. For more than a decade, BioVex has pursued the development of a cytolytic live virus vaccine called OncoVEX GM-CSF, based on molecular modification of a proprietary strain of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1. The virus has been engineered to permit relatively selective replication in cancer cells, and has also been modified to defeat a crucial mechanism that Herpes Simplex Virus uses to evade immune detection. 
And this change, coupled with the expression of an embedded GM-CSF cassette, improves immune recognition of tumor cells in and around the cyto virus injection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that injection of this virus into tumors causes direct tumor cell lices, and also stimulates immune destruction of distant tumor cells. These observations led to the initiation of two Phase 3 studies, both under special protocol assessment with the FDA. One in patients with malignant melanoma and the second, in patients with head and neck cancer. The melanoma study in particular is more than 90% enrolled. 
I will have a great deal more to say about this program and about many of our other programs during our business review meeting in April. Kevin?"

Any way that we want to measure it, numbers of products, innovation, number of molecules, advancing into human subjects. We also noticed that after we had the challenges of 2007 and the ESA, we've tended to leave the Discovery Research area a bit less well-funded than we otherwise would have, given the amount of money that went into clinical trials.

I'll tell you my sense is, I'm extremely optimistic, and that's of course an important part of why we proceeded with the transaction."

The objective of this call is to review our solid performance last year despite the impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform. We'll also provide a perspective on the growth outlook for 2011. 2010 was truly a notable year as we received approval for and launched two very important therapies, Prolia and XGEVA. 
You'll hear more on these launches during the call together with updates on progress we have made towards advancing our pipeline. As we did for the third quarter call, we'll follow a streamlined format for our prepared remarks. I think this formant was well appreciated, as I received many favorable comments after our last call. In other words, we'll focus only on those comments that provide added clarity on issues outlined in our press release. So with that, I would like to introduce our presenters. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, who will lead the discussion by providing a strategic overview of our business, as well as comments on the acquisition of BioVex that we announced today.

Before I share my thoughts about our 2010 results and 2011 prospects, I'd like to just take a minute to reflect. Each year, any large global company in virtually any industry faces a number of uncertainties and last year was especially fraught for us as we think about just ae year ago. I'm especially proud and pleased to say that Amgen met our challenges successfully and set the stage for a promising future. Here are just few of the highlights: Prolia and XGEVA were approved after 15 years of effort, over $1.5 billion of investment and the tireless work of uncounted members of our team. We're proud of these result. I think it's biotechnology at its best, and we look forward to helping patients enjoy the benefit of this set of innovations. The bone mass prevention study we announced the results of toward the end of last year, or so called 147 study, added to the benefit of XGEVA. Roger will talk more about our regulatory prospects and plans there, but clearly, this is a landmark result.  We're proud of it. 
Three, we delivered financially even in the face of tremendous health care reform and reimbursement headwinds around the world. We effectively and thoughtfully represented patient interest at a variety of public government-sponsored reviews of aspects of our ESA franchise. That continues this year, as we'll talk about in a minute. We advanced our pipeline in many ways. We made significant management changes in naming a new Chief Operating Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. We maintained the highest compliance standards and performance in an increasingly challenging environment. 
And finally, we successfully again represented and defended our intellectual property. 2010 was a superb operational year for Amgen, and I want to thank Amgen's staff worldwide for their efforts. It was truly exceptional. Our focus on 2011 is easy to describe, but as always, challenging to execute. First, we can't take our eyes off and we won't take our eyes off the core business in all of its aspects. The recent MEDCAC discussions made me proud of our work for patients. We need to and will advance Prolia and XGEVA. Prolia is a promising therapy for osteoporosis that is growing. However, predicting the ramp rate of any new technology in any business is challenging. However, our efforts and enthusiasm both are very high. 
XGEVA is off to a strong start, and we're very optimistic with the 147 study, only increasing our confidence. We need to and will advance, enlarge and enrich our pipeline. 
Today's announcement of our BioVex acquisition is indicative of our objectives. Good company, good science have potential advance for patients with grievous illness with few good treatment options. We were also thoughtful about using shareholder dollars in this acquisition and balancing risk and reward. By the way, the buybacks acquisition-related costs in 2011 are reflected in our guidance that we'll share in a moment. 
Next, we're going to grow shareholder value by keeping our financial promises, executing a smart strategy well, thoughtful use of our cash and making our pipeline even stronger. We are hopeful this year as the major overhangs or the mega-overhangs of the past recede, this will be possible. While we will never be without challenges and uncertainties, I like our prospects. We look forward to on April 21 in New York City at a business review, sharing more with you about our plans and prospects, and we'll reach out soon to large shareholders to be sure we meet your needs and expectations for that meeting. 
Jon, I'd like to turn it over to you now."
24816,116155760,94962,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. We'll take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minu",820,"Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. We'll take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minutes. 
Other revenues during the quarter benefited from a milestone payment received from Takeda on initiation of AMG 386 Phase 3 trial  for ovarian cancer. Operating expenses were 1% lower in the quarter versus a year ago. There were a number of factors contributing to this: First, cost of sales were higher by 6%. This was primarily due to inventory write-offs from the Enbrel voluntary recall and some higher bulk material costs  flowing through inventory. Research and development costs were 5% lower, primarily due to licensing fee payments to Array BioPharma that we paid in the fourth quarter of last year. SG&A was held broadly in line with 2009. 
The adjusted tax rate was 15.5% compared to 18.8% for the year. This was due to the full-year benefit of the R&D tax credit that was enacted late in the year and fully recognized in the fourth quarter. The low tax rate that you see in the fourth quarter 2009 was due to a change in revenue and expense mix during that quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share $1.17 was up $0.12, helped by share buybacks. In our GAAP earnings, you'll see we also took an impairment charge of $118 million, related to the transfer of our Fremont manufacturing facility to Boehringer Ingelheim. Bob will talk more about the operational impact of this transaction.
Turning to the full year on Page 6, total revenues were 3% higher compared to 2009. Other revenues grew 35% primarily, due to milestone payments received from GSK for the Prolia approval in Europe and from Takeda for Vectibix approval in Japan. Operating expenses increased 4% compared to 2009. The main drivers here were cost of sales, which again were up 6% from the year, primarily due to higher inventory write-offs from the EPOGEN, PROCRIT and Enbrel recalls and from some higher bulk-material costs. 
SG&A costs were 5% higher due to our investment in the Prolia launch during the year and some high litigation costs. Research and development costs were broadly in line with 2009. The adjusted tax rate on the year was 18.8% compared to 16.9% in 2009. Last year's rate benefited from tax settlement that were concluded during the year.  Adjusted earnings per share was $5.21, up $0.30 or up 6%. 
The key balance sheet and cash flow movements are shown on Page 7. Our cash balance increased by $4 billion to $17.4 billion. Our net cash balance increased by $1.5 billion as we issued debt of $2.5 billion during the year, in anticipation of paying down a $2.5 billion convertible, which matures in February. In 2011, the acquisition of BioVex that Roger will talk more about, will result in a payment of $425 million to buyback shareholders on closing. Further payments of up to $575 million will be made upon the achievement of certain defined regulatory and sales milestones in future years. 
Cash flow from operations was $5.8 billion for the year compared to $6.3 billion in 2009 . This reduction was predominantly due to the timing of U.S. tax payments over the two-year period. Capital expenditures were held at $600 million, slightly above 2009. And finally, the total cost of shares repurchased in 2010 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2009. The benefit of this program can be seen in our adjusted EPS results for the year.
Page 8 provides our guidance for 2011. We expect to deliver revenues of between $15.1 billion and $15.5 billion. Our plan is assumed a Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the low 130s, and we're not assuming any significant movement from this. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.20. This reflects total U.S. Healthcare Reform costs, which we estimate at $400 million to $500 million in 2011, and that includes the new federal excise fee, which we estimate will be between $150 million and $200 million. This compares to total Healthcare Reform costs in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Our guidance overall reflects a plan to grow adjusted EPS before the impact of the federal excise fee. 
One other factor in our guidance is an expectation that we will invest more in research and development in 2011. This reflects an increased number of Phase 3 programs, the BioVex acquisition that we announced today and a step up in our discovery research investments. This will be partly offset by an expected improvement in cost of sales in 2011. Our 2011 adjusted tax rate, we expect to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million similar to the last year. 
And so now, I'll hand it over to Bob to review commercial operations."

I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the p",1048,"Okay. Thank you, Jon. I'll provide a high-level of summary of our global commercial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, followed by some high-level comments on a number of prospective issues. Consistent with our third quarter call, the product-by-product details are contained in our appendix in the press release, and I'll not present that material here, but Jim Daly and I are available to answer questions about the product specific slides during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year fourth quarter comparison, our global product sales remained relatively unchanged, which was a function of several offsetting factors. First, in U.S., Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered 3% and 4% growth respectively, and globally, our more recently launched products, including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA grew $82 million or 29%. EPOGEN sales declined by $112 million or 16% during the quarter. Within the EPOGEN decline, there are several important factors however to bear in mind. First, it's worth pointing out that roughly half of the sales decline was due to the non-demand related items such as changes in wholesaler inventory levels and changes to accounting estimates. The remainder of the sales decline was due to demand, reflecting the decline in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. 
As we shared with you on our third quarter call, we expected to see this dose decline as providers began in the fourth quarter to refine their treatment practices ahead of the implementation of the ESRD bundle, which went into effect at the beginning of this year. For the full year, our global product sales grew by $309 million or 2%, which was mainly due to growth from our newer products, which grew by $278 million for the year and from increased Filgrastim sales. 
I'll make one final comment on our 2010 performance, which is to note that U.S. Healthcare Reform decreased sales by $65 million for the quarter, and $198 million for the year. Looking ahead to 2011, you've just heard Jon provide revenue guidance. It's important to note that we're anticipating several factors will shape product sales in 2011. We can't rule out further impact to Aranesp from the ESA REMS, and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. 
With respect to EPOGEN, we expect further moderate dose declines, as providers refine their treatment practices to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. As we've stated before, we believe the ESRD quality improvement program is important in preserving access to important medicines for patients on dialysis and demonstrates a commitment by CMS to these principles. 
Our 2011 guidance assumes a moderate impact on EPOGEN dose, front loaded to the first half of the year, and what we are seeing today is consistent with that assumption. Our guidance does not reflect the dramatic change in utilization for EPOGEN or Aranesp as a result of any major new regulatory or reimbursement changes. I know there's a great deal of interest in this, and we'll obviously keep you informed on utilization patterns as the year progresses. 
And finally for 2011, were excited about the Denosumab opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, I'll speak more about the Prolia and XGEVA launches. We continue to make steady progress with Prolia, and we're encouraged by the trajectory, particularly that we saw in November and December. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 9,000 physicians have now ordered or prescribed Prolia, and 40% of these have placed additional orders. Primary care physicians represent about 60% of our total prescribers, and it's worth noting that approximately 2/3 of our targeted rheumatologists have prescribed Prolia at this point. 
Both specialist and primary care physicians are predominantly using “buy and bill” fulfillment to provide Prolia with low patient out-of-pocket costs. We expect that the primary care prescribing base will expand as various prescription drug plans announce their Medicare Part D coverage for Prolia, and we expect this to happen -- to be announced in the first quarter and to be implemented in the second quarter of this year. 
Outside of the U.S., we launched and secured full reimbursement in nine countries in 2010, including the U.K. and Australia, which are known for their rigorous reimbursement policies. In 2011, we expect an additional 19 launches to provide growth outside of the U.S. 
Turning to XGEVA, we're excited about the opportunity this important medicine provides for patients, and we're seeing usage come both from oncologists and urologists and we're encouraged by the early signs from the launch. As you know however, we had only a few days in which to promote the product in 2010, so naturally, we'll have more to say about this in April with our first quarter results.
Turning now to Slide 12. This slide displays our actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs in blue are largely a result of wholesaler inventory buildup in depletion not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red lines indicate average weekly sales, and these lines exclude returns or discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. The drop in weekly average sales for Aranesp from 2009 to 2010, as I'm sure you're all aware, is due primarily to a decline in the overall ESA segment, reflecting more conservative use of ESAs in both ontology and Nephrology. As you can see, the average weekly sales for Aranesp stabilized in the sequential quarters of 2010, as the impact from the more conservative use of ESAs was fully incorporated into treatment practices. However, we can't rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales going forward as a result of the REMS rollout or from any major new regulatory reimbursement changes. 
Finally, to comment on manufacturing, we announced earlier this month that we had entered into a transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim, through which they have acquired our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. This move is consistent with our off-stated desire to optimize our manufacturing supply chain and to improve our efficient and safe supply of medicines for patients. This move is made possible by productivity improvements across the  rest of our network. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, who'll talk about research and development progress in the quarter."
24816,116155760,94962,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. T",894,"Thanks, Bob. Well as Kevin has already noted and as shown on Slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen Research and Development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. This approval was based on three large randomized blinded active comparator controlled studies, that showed that XGEVA, administered once monthly by subcutaneous injection was superior to the then standard of care, Zometa, in reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases, secondary breast and prostate cancer, and was not inferior in reducing the frequency of these events in patients with other  solid tumors, but with multiple myeloma. 
XGEVA was approved by the FDA on a priority review basis, just six months after filing. The XGEVA file is also under review by the European Medicines Agency and in other jurisdictions worldwide. All of these reviews are proceeding appropriately. In December, we also obtained topline results from our 147 study, which asked whether administration of XGEVA reduced the risk of skeletal metastases in patients with prostate cancer who are at high-risk of sustaining a first metastasis to bone. The successful completion of this study provides for the first time to my knowledge, clinical evidence supporting the view that tumors must activate the RANK Ligand access to optimally penetrate bone. 
There's still a great deal to learn about the results of the 147 study. However, our more detailed analysis, which includes a variety of sensitivity studies, confirms and extends what we have seen in the top line data summary that we disclosed last month. We will meet with the FDA to discuss this study in the very near future, and at present, expect to file for approval of this new indication in the first half of 2011. Of course, we're continuing to study Denosumabin variety of other settings, both in patients with cancer and in those with other forms of bone loss. I'll have more to say about these studies during future earnings calls. 
During the fourth quarter, we also completed our filing for Vectibix in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, in combination with other chemo therapeutic agents in the first and second line setting. These filings include specific reference to the importance of limiting therapy to those patients whose tumors contain only wild type, that is un-mutated, versions the of the KRAS gene, and were timed to permit simultaneous filing of a diagnostic tests for mutations in KRAS, which we completed with our partner Kyogen. The data from our filings are already under review in other jurisdictions. 
Also noted on Slide 14, we have revised our view of the timing of completion of the Sensipar EVOLVE study based on additional scrutiny of event rate data. You'll recall that the EVOLVE study assesses long term Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are treated with Sensipar from Mimpara in Europe as compared to those receiving placebo. Extrapolation of the current event rate for this fully-enrolled trial indicates that we will not achieve a sufficient number of events until 2012. 
As shown on Slide 15, we also made substantial progress in the fourth quarter with respect to the advancement of our mid-stage pipeline. We enrolled the first patients in our Phase 3 study of AMG 386, an angiopoietin antagonist peptibody for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Promising Phase II data in the same setting were discussed at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last June. We also began initiating sites for our Phase 3 study of AMG 479 and IGF-1 receptor antagonist antibody, used in combination with gemcitabine, in the setting of pancreatic cancer.  Phase II data for this program were also presented at ASCO last year. 
Also on Slide 15, I note that we now expect to complete the Phase 3 MONET-1 study in the first half of this year. You'll recall, this study asks whether daily treatment with Motesanib, an oral multi-kinase  inhibitor, improves overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who are simultaneously receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin therapies. 
Lastly, on Slide 16. Today we announced that we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire BioVex, a small privately held company based in Woburn, Massachusetts. For more than a decade, BioVex has pursued the development of a cytolytic live virus vaccine called OncoVEX GM-CSF, based on molecular modification of a proprietary strain of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1. The virus has been engineered to permit relatively selective replication in cancer cells, and has also been modified to defeat a crucial mechanism that Herpes Simplex Virus uses to evade immune detection. 
And this change, coupled with the expression of an embedded GM-CSF cassette, improves immune recognition of tumor cells in and around the cyto virus injection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that injection of this virus into tumors causes direct tumor cell lices, and also stimulates immune destruction of distant tumor cells. These observations led to the initiation of two Phase 3 studies, both under special protocol assessment with the FDA. One in patients with malignant melanoma and the second, in patients with head and neck cancer. The melanoma study in particular is more than 90% enrolled. 
I will have a great deal more to say about this program and about many of our other programs during our business review meeting in April. Kevin?"

And as I say, we'll have a lot more to talk about after this deal formally closes, and when we discuss it at the Business Review. But suffice it to say that the results of administration of this vaccine are very impressive from the Phase II studies. We don't know of course about Phase III. BioVex has presented some of these data in public forums. And as you kind of look at it, I think you'll probably get comfortable with the fact that there really is a dramatic effect on tumors, both proximal and distal lesions, as a result of administration of this virus. With time, we'll find out how significant that really is."

There are open-label extensions associated with these studies. There are large pharmaco business programs. So we are continuing to support those products, for which we've already gained registration, but we're also advancing in a number of really important Phase III  programs, new molecules that I highlighted a little bit on the call, and we'll talk about more in April. So that adds quite a lot to the expense. We think it's extremely well justified. We're doing the right thing in terms of trying to really make meaningful impact on patients who suffer from grievous illness. And as Kevin mentioned, it's important to make sure that Discovery and Research is adequately funded, so that we'll be in a position to pursue a next set of important clinical trials in years down the road. So that's where we stand. There is a significant increase this year. We're pleased to be able to do it and we think we can really, really use that investment."

And what we studied for 147 were patients who were at high risk but did not yet have clinical metastases. Now any patient who already has evident metastasis judged by bone scan or other criteria, is at risk for skeletal-related events. And in that population, we've already demonstrated that we can dramatically reduce these skeletal-related events, and there's already an indication for that. So the sense is that the 147 data, and again, it must be reviewed by the agency, will simply expand the group of patients for whom XGEVA is an appropriate therapy. Obviously, there are a lot of both regulatory-impaired groups that need to opine. But that's the general sense that one gets from looking at the total set of data."

Thanks for joining us today and I look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow here in New York. We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is maki",326,"Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and I look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow here in New York. We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is making good progress and roll and our franchise had a strong quarter. We also made very good progress on the pipeline. 
You will notice that operating expenses this quarter showed a 13% increase compared to the first quarter of '10, amounting to an increase of about $260 million. This increase is unusual for Amgen, which has remained is up and with having revenues lead expenses. I want to explain this difference. Jon will talk as Bob and Roger a bit more about it. 
2011 is an investment year for Amgen, as we launched two new products in the United States and internationally and add additional support for our emerging pipeline. And as we transition three promising programs from Phase II to Phase III. These new costs in support of Prolia and XGEVA and additional R&D support amount to approximately $130 million of this expense increase. 
Secondly, approximately $50 million of the expenses are triggered by the first quarterly payment about the new Healthcare Reform fee and the new Puerto Rico excise tax fee, neither of which was reflected in our Q1 '10 expenses. Finally, approximately $60 million of these new costs reflect higher embryo profit share triggered by strong first quarter of Ambrose sales and onetime adjustment expenses associated with our care and Amgen partnership agreements. As I mentioned, Jon and Roger will have more to say about this in a few minutes. 
Our 2011 investments and the new expenses I have described are incorporated in our 2011 guidance. A number of you have asked about Amgen's plans regarding payment of the dividend. We will cover Amgen's capital allocation plan, including dividends in detail at our investor meeting tomorrow. Jon?"

So ahead of the broader review of the business tomorrow, I'll take a few minutes to walk through our results for the quarter and reinforce some of the comments just made by Kevin. 
So if you turn to Page 5 of the presentation deck. I'll walk through the P&L here with you. So in summary, we grew revenues to $3.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales data in the call. You'll also see this other revenues grew in the quarter by $24 million. This was due to a couple of items. First the milestone payment received from a stylus for the filing of AMG 223 in Japan. And secondly recoveries on AMG 827 development costs from our partner care and Amgen. 
Also as highlighted by Kevin, operating cost increased by 13% in the quarter compared to last year. You'll recall that we highlighted in our guidance for 2011 that R&D costs would be higher this year relative to 2010. As outlined tomorrow, we expect to maintain our investment level in R&D between 18% and 20% of sales. Quarter 1 2010 costs at 17.5% of sales benefited from some one-time trucks on XGEVA clinical trial costs. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we are investing in the full cost of the Phase III trials for AMG 386 and 479. And in addition, we've accelerated the marketing authorization approvals for several of our marketed products in international markets. As an indication of this, we've achieved 24 marketing authorization approvals over the most recent 12 months, 2x the number that we have achieved in the prior period. So all of this contributed to an investment level of 19.4% of sales in the first quarter. 
On operating expenses, were also reflected the full cost of launching Prolia and XGEVA, neither of which were approved in the same period last year. In addition to these strategic investments in R&D and our launch products which amounted in total to around $130 million, we faced some new legislative costs which in total as Kevin mentioned amounted to just over $50 million. The new U.S. Healthcare Reform the was incurred in the first time in the quarter and amounted to $39 million. 
We also started to bear the cost of the new Puerto Rico excise tax. This is accounted for as an addition to our manufacturing costs. It's capitalized in inventory and expense as a product is sold. In Q1, the cost amounted to around $13 million. 
The third category of cost increases in the quarter related to partnership costs which amounted to around $60 million in total. The biggest component of this was an increase in ample profit share payments to Pfizer. Other consequences of the 9% reported growth for the product in the quarter. The balance primarily relates to cost associated with our current Amgen partnership. 
Moving to net income. Net income was down 2% and that benefited from some one-time gains realized from rebalancing our investment portfolio during the quarter. 
And then moving to the adjusted tax rate. You'll see that was 16.6% compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits, associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax. Based on our recent notice issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we've assumed credit stability of this excise tax on product manufactured for the U.S. market. As a result, our adjusted tax rate is lower by the amount of the foreign tax credit. While as outlined above, a significant proportion of the tax paid will be expensed in future periods when the product is sold out of inventory. 
On an annual basis, this will have a relatively small impact in our P&L, but the accounting treatment clearly drives timing differences within quarters. Excluding the impact to the Puerto Rico tax, our adjusted tax rate would've been 20.9%. 
Adjusted earnings per share at the bottom of the page grew 3%. And this benefited from share repurchases during 2010 and you'll note average shares outstanding during the quarter, were 5% lower compared to a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 6 and turning to the balance sheet. Our net cash position continued to strengthen in the quarter. Cash balances increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. In February and as planned, we also retired $2.5 billion convertible bonds. And consequently, we reduced our outstanding debt to $11.2 billion. So overall, our net cash balances were up $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2010. 
During the quarter, on cash flows, we generated $900 million in free cash flow, and we didn't repurchase shares during this quarter. I'll talk more about our capital allocation plans tomorrow during the business review. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that in summary, we are reaffirming the guidance for 2011 that we communicated earlier this year. The only exception to this is the adjusted tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 15% to 16%. And again, this reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the newly enacted Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico impact, we still expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. And as outlined earlier, this is a credit against the tax charge and cost of sales and it shouldn't have a material impact on net income or EPS for the year as a whole, even though there was some benefit during this quarter. Let me hand over to Bob for a brief commercial review."

On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first quarter, in particular I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results and will be providing much more detail tomorrow.",693,"Alright.  Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first quarter, in particular I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results and will be providing much more detail tomorrow.
As you can see, our global product sales grew by 3% versus 1% in the first quarter of 2010 and this growth was driven primarily by several factors. In the U.S., as we've already mentioned, and Brill and Filgrastim delivered strong results with growth of 9% and 8% respectively and that was driven primarily by a combination of price and unit demand. In the U.S., EBITDA sales were down by $88 million or 14% during the quarter. This decline was due to the lower utilization driven by changes in the market arising from bundling. Provide detail tomorrow money but in general, wanted to know that this call that bundling is playing out pretty much as we expected when we talk to you in January and we continue to believe that we'll see a midteens percent gross decline 2011 which were partially offset by patient population growth and the by price. 
Actemra sales were down 7% during the first quarter, with sales down 7% in the U.S. and 8% outside of the U.S. The implementation of REMS which was finalized in the first quarter here in the U.S. have some impact on sales. And in Europe, the trends were influenced by some erosion in pricing units although our market share remain stable through the period internationally. 
Our newer products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA globally grew by $101 million or 34% in the quarter and I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our launch products in particular Prolia and XGEVA to give you a bit more color on the performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 10, I included a graph showing the cumulative syringes sold in the U.S. and that's represented in green on the slide. So as you can see in the U.S., growth is accelerating nicely and to give you some sense of this. In 2010, it took us six months to generate sales of the first 30,000 syringes. And in the U.S. in 2011, we've reached roughly that same number of syringes half the time including growth in March of 60% over the level that we achieved in February. 
Looking at the business in the U.S., we estimated that about 20% of our Prolia patients were treatment naive, but obviously presented with multiple risk factors. The primary care community continues to represent the bulk of prescribing in the quarter. It was about 2/3 of the prescribing physicians and they're generating about 60% of the Prolia usage. And then the second half of the year, we expect retail access through Part D, returning patients and the commencement of our DTC promotion, to service catalysts for Prolia and the launch, and I'll provide of is the much more detail on that tomorrow. 
Turning now to XGEVA on Slide 11 with revenues of $42 million in its first full quarters of launch. We're very pleased with the broad uptake that we have seen so far. Looking at patients on XGEVA today in oncology clinics. 2/3 of our patients were previously treated with an intravenous, primarily as a method of course and the remaining 1/3 were new to treatment. All these patients about half of them were breast cancer patients, followed by prostate and other solid tumors.
The products being used broadly in the oncology setting. With respect to prostate, three quarters of the XGEVA use has been provided in hospitals in oncology clinics, with the remaining quarter in urology clinics where we already have a very strong patient share of about 40%. The reimbursement landscape for XGEVA is very favorable. On the medical front, all medical carriers have confirmed coverage in part B. and virtually all commercialized have coverage with a vast majority of commercialized having no medical benefit restrictions. So we'll cover obviously the outlook for XGEVA in greater detail tomorrow. And now we'll turn to Roger will give you a brief update on R&D."

Going forward, again as Jon mentioned, we're paying close attention to our expense trajectory and we've implemented to get of the Prolia investments that will insure careful management of expenses in R&D. I'll leave most of the discussion of our pipeline progression through tomorrow's business review, followed by however, I will make a few comments about our regulatory activities. 
First, we continue to have productive scientific discussions with the FDA and improving the labels for stimulating agents. Our goal is to ensure that the risks associated with targeting high hemoglobin values in patients with chronic kidney disease are well articulated and placed in an appropriate context for patients not on dialysis and for dialysis patients as well. We are making good progress. 
The European regulatory review of XGEVA remains on track as the XGEVA review in other jurisdictions. As previously announced. We have appealed to the CHMP for reconsideration of Vectibix to use in combination with chemotherapy to the treatment of colorectal cancers that contain unmutated KRAS genes. Review of this indication is also proceeding in the United States. 
During the first quarter, we announced that our Phase IIb study off my best in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer go to meet its primary endpoint of improvement in overall survival. Many patients did however, appear to benefit from the use of what has been in combination with traditional chemotherapy in this trial. Additional analysis of this very large data set are underway. 
And finally, in the first quarter, we made very substantial progress in advancing our Phase II pipeline including AMG 827 and AMG 785. I'll have a great day what to say out the bids at a business review tomorrow. Kevin?"

We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is making good progress, and Enbrel and Filgrastim franchise had a strong quarter. We also made very good progress on the pipeline. 
You will notice that operating expenses this quarter show a 13% increase compared to the first quarter of '10, amounting to an increase of about $260 million. This increase is unusual for Amgen, which has been and remains disciplined about having revenues lead expenses. I want to explain this difference. Jon will talk, as will Bob and Roger, a bit more about it. 
2011 is an investment year for Amgen, as we launched two new products in the United States and internationally and add additional support for our emerging pipeline. And as we transition 3 promising programs from Phase II to Phase III. These new cause in support of Prolia and XGEVA and additional R&D support amount to approximately $130 million of this expense increase. 
Secondly, approximately $50 million of the expenses are triggered by the first quarterly payment about the new Healthcare Reform Fee and the new Puerto Rico excise tax fee, neither of which was reflected in our Q1 '10 expenses. Finally, approximately $60 million of these new costs reflect higher Enbrel profit share triggered by strong first quarter of Enbrel sales and a onetime adjustment expenses associated with our Kineret [ph] Amgen partnership agreements. As I mentioned, Jon and Roger will have more to say about this in a few minutes. 
Our 2011 investments and the new expenses I have described are incorporated in our 2011 guidance. A number of you have asked about Amgen's plans regarding payment of the dividend. We will cover Amgen's capital allocation plans, including dividends in detail at our investor meeting tomorrow. Jon?"

So ahead of the broader review of the business tomorrow, I'll take a few minutes to walk through our results for the quarter and reinforce some of the comments just made by Kevin. 
So if you turn to Page 5 of the presentation deck. I'll walk through the P&L here with you. So in summary, we grew revenues to $3.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales later on the call. You'll also see that other revenues grew in the quarter by $24 million. This was due to a couple of items. First the milestone payment received from a Astellas for the filing of AMG 223 in Japan. And secondly, recoveries on AMG 827 development costs from our partner Kineret, Amgen [ph]. 
Also as highlighted by Kevin, operating cost increased by 13% in the quarter compared to last year. You'll recall that we highlighted in our guidance for 2011 that R&D costs would be higher this year relative to 2010. As I'll outline tomorrow, we expect to maintain our investment level in R&D between 18% and 20% of sales. Quarter 1 2010 costs at 17.5% of sales benefited from some one-time troughs on XGEVA clinical trial costs. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we're investing in the full cost of the Phase III trials for AMG 386 and 479. And in addition, we've accelerated the marketing authorization approvals for several of our marketed products in international markets. As an indication of this, we've achieved 24 marketing authorization approvals over the most recent 12 months, 2x the number that we achieved in the prior period. So all of this contributed to an investment level of 19.4% of sales in the first quarter. 
On operating expenses, were also reflected the full cost of launching Prolia and XGEVA, neither of which were approved in the same period last year. In addition to these strategic investments in R&D and our launched products, which amounted in total to around $130 million, we faced some new legislative costs which in total, as Kevin mentioned, amounted to just over $50 million. The new U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee was incurred for the first time in the quarter and amounted to $39 million. 
We also started to bear the cost of the new Puerto Rico excise tax. This is accounted for as an addition to our manufacturing costs. It's capitalized in inventory and expensed as the product is sold. In Q1, the costs amounted to around $13 million. 
The third category of cost increases in the quarter related to partnership costs, which amounted to around $60 million in total. The biggest component of this was an increase in Enbrel profit share payments to Pfizer. Other consequence of the 9% reported growth for the product in the quarter. The balance primarily relates to cost associated with our Kineret-Amgen [ph] partnership. 
Moving to net income. Net income was down 2% and that benefited from some one-time gains realized from rebalancing our investment portfolio during the quarter. 
And then moving to the adjusted tax rate. You'll see, that was 16.6% compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax. Based on our recent notice issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we've assumed creditability of this excise tax on product manufactured for the U.S. market. As a result, our adjusted tax rate is lower by the amount of the foreign tax credit. While as outlined above, a significant proportion of the tax paid will be expensed in future periods when the product is sold out of inventory. 
On an annual basis, this will have a relatively small impact on our P&L, but the accounting treatment clearly drives timing differences within quarters. Excluding the impact to the Puerto Rico tax, our adjusted tax rate would've been 20.9%. 
Adjusted earnings per share at the bottom of the page grew 3%. And this benefited from share repurchases during 2010, and you'll note average shares outstanding during the quarter, were 5% lower compared to a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 6 and turning to the balance sheet. Our net cash position continued to strengthen in the quarter. Cash balances increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. In February and as planned, we also retired $2.5 billion convertible bonds. And consequently, we reduced our outstanding debt to $11.2 billion. So overall, our net cash balances were up $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2010. 
During the quarter, on cash flows, we generated $900 million in free cash flow, and we didn't repurchase shares during this quarter. I'll talk more about our capital allocation plans tomorrow during the Business Review. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that in summary, we're reaffirming the guidance for 2011 that we communicated earlier this year. The only exception to this is the adjusted tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 15% to 16%. And again, this reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the newly enacted Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico impact, we still expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. And as outlined earlier, this is a credit against the tax charge and cost of sales and it shouldn't have a material impact on net income or EPS for the year as a whole, even though there were some benefit during this quarter. Let me hand over to Bob for a brief commercial review."

Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first quarter, in particular, I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results and will be providing much more detail tomorrow.
As you can see, our global product sales grew by 3% versus 1% -- sorry, versus the first quarter of 2010, and this growth was driven primarily by several factors. In U.S., as we've already mentioned, Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered strong results with growth of 9% and 8% respectively and that was driven primarily by a combination of price and unit demand. In the U.S., EPOGEN sales were down by $88 million or 14% during the quarter. This decline was due to the lower dose utilization driven by changes in the market arising from bundling. And I'll provide plenty of detail tomorrow on bundling, but in general, I wanted to note on this call that bundling is playing out pretty much as we expected when we talked to you in January, and we continue to believe that we'll see a midteens percent dose decline in 2011, which will be partially offset by patient population growth and by price. 
Aranesp sales were down 7% during the first quarter, with sales down 7% in the U.S. and 8% outside of the U.S. The implementation of REMS, which was finalized in the first quarter here in the U.S. have some impact on sales. And in Europe, the trends were influenced by some erosion in price and units, although our market share remain stable through the period internationally. 
Our newer products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA globally grew by $101 million or 34% on the quarter, and I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our launch products in particular, Prolia and XGEVA, to give you a bit more color on their performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 10, I have included a graph showing the cumulative syringes sold in the U.S. and that's represented in green on the slide. So as you can see in the U.S., growth is accelerating nicely. And to give you some sense of this, in 2010, it took us 6 months to generate sales of the first 30,000 syringes. And in the U.S. in 2011, we've reached roughly that same number of syringes in half the time, including growth in March of 60% over the level that we achieved in February. 
Looking at the business in the U.S., we estimate that about 20% of our Prolia patients were treatment naive, but obviously presented with multiple risk factors. The primary care community continues to represent the bulk of prescribing. On the quarter, it was about 2/3 of the prescribing physicians and they are generating about 60% of the Prolia usage. And then, the second half of the year, we expect retail access through Part D, returning patients and the commencement of our DTC [direct-to-consumer] promotion, the service catalysts for Prolia in the launch. And I'll provide, obviously, much more detail on that tomorrow. 
Turning now to XGEVA on Slide 11, with revenues of $42 million in its first quarters since launch, we're very pleased with the broad uptake that we've seen so far. Looking at patients on XGEVA to date, in oncology clinics, 2/3 of our patients were previously treated with an intravenous Bisphosphonate, primarily as a matter of course, and the remaining 1/3 were new to treatment. All these patients, about half of them were breast cancer patients, followed by prostate and other solid tumors. The products being used broadly in the oncology setting. 
With respect to prostate, three quarters of the XGEVA use has been provided in hospitals and oncology clinics, with the remaining quarter in urology clinics where we already have a very strong patient share of about 40%. The reimbursement landscape for XGEVA is very favorable. On the Medicare front, all Medicare carriers have confirmed coverage on Part B, and virtually all commercialized have coverage, with the vast majority of commercialized having no medical benefit restriction. So we'll cover, obviously, the outlook for XGEVA in greater detail tomorrow. Now let me turn to Roger who'll give you a brief update on R&D."

We've also invested in regulatory affairs and observational research as part of our commitment to international expansion. Going forward, again as Jon mentioned, we're paying close attention to our expense trajectory, and we've implemented a gated approach to investments that will insure careful management of expenses in R&D. I'll leave most of the discussion of our pipeline progression to tomorrow's Business Review, however, I will make a few comments about our regulatory activities. 
First, we continue to have productive scientific discussions with the FDA and to the improving the labels for erythropoietic stimulating agents. Our goal is to ensure that the risks associated with targeting high hemoglobin values in patients with chronic kidney disease are well articulated and placed in an appropriate context for patients not on dialysis and for dialysis patients as well. We're making good progress. 
The European regulatory review of XGEVA remains on track, as does the XGEVA review in other jurisdictions. As previously announced, we've appealed to the CHMP for reconsideration of Vectibix for use in combination with chemotherapy to the treatment of colorectal cancers that contain unmutated KRAS genes. Review of this indication is also proceeding in the United States. 
During the first quarter, we announced that our Phase III study of Motesanib for the first line treatment of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, failed to meet its primary endpoint of improvement and overall survival. Many patients did however, appear to benefit from the use of Motesanib in combination with traditional chemotherapy in this trial. Additional analysis of this very large data set are underway. 
And finally, in the first quarter, we made very substantial progress in advancing our Phase II pipeline including AMG 827 and AMG 785. I'll have a great deal more to say about this at the Business Review tomorrow. Kevin?"

We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is making good progress, and Enbrel and our Filgrastim franchise had a strong quarter. We also made very good progress on the pipeline. 
You will notice that operating expenses this quarter show a 13% increase compared to the first quarter of '10, amounting to an increase of about $260 million. This increase is unusual for Amgen, which has been and remains disciplined about having revenues lead expenses. I want to explain this difference. Jon will talk, as will Bob and Roger, a bit more about it. 
2011 is an investment year for Amgen, as we launch two new products in the United States and internationally and add additional support for our emerging pipeline. And as we transition 3 promising programs from Phase II to Phase III. These new costs in support of Prolia and XGEVA and additional R&D support amount to approximately $130 million of this expense increase. 
Secondly, approximately $50 million of the expenses are triggered by the first quarterly payment about the new Healthcare Reform Fee and the new Puerto Rico excise tax fee, neither of which was reflected in our Q1 '10 expenses. Finally, approximately $60 million of these new costs reflect higher Enbrel profit share triggered by strong first quarter Enbrel sales and a onetime adjustment in expenses associated with our Kirin-Amgen partnership agreements. As I mentioned, Jon and Roger will have more to say about this in a few minutes. 
Our 2011 investments and the new expenses I have described are incorporated in our 2011 guidance. A number of you have asked about Amgen's plans regarding payment of a dividend. We will cover Amgen's capital allocation plans, including dividends, in detail at our investor meeting tomorrow. Jon?"
24816,129221206,116171,"Amgen Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin.

So ahead of the broader review of the business tomorrow, I'll take a few minutes to walk through our results for the quarter and reinforce some of the comments just made by Kevin. 
So if you turn to Page 5 of the presentation deck. I'll walk through the P&L here with you. So in summary, we grew revenues to $3.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales later on the call. You'll also see that other revenues grew in the quarter by $24 million. This was due to a couple of items. First a milestone payment received from Astellas for the filing of AMG 223 in Japan. And secondly, recoveries on AMG 827 development costs from our partner Kirin-Amgen. 
Also as highlighted by Kevin, operating costs increased by 13% in the quarter compared to last year. You'll recall that we highlighted in our guidance for 2011 that R&D costs would be higher this year relative to 2010. As I'll outline tomorrow, we expect to maintain our investment level in R&D of between 18% and 20% of sales. Quarter 1 2010 costs at 17.5% of sales benefited from some one-time true-ups on XGEVA clinical trial costs. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we're investing in the full cost of the Phase III trials for AMG 386 and 479. And in addition, we've accelerated the marketing authorization approvals for several of our marketed products in international markets. As an indication of this, we've achieved 24 marketing authorization approvals over the most recent 12 months, 2x the number that we achieved in the prior period. So all of this contributed to an investment level of 19.4% of sales in the first quarter. 
Operating expenses also reflected the full cost of launching Prolia and XGEVA, neither of which were approved in the same period last year. In addition to these strategic investments in R&D and our launched products, which amounted in total to around $130 million, we faced some new legislative costs which, in total, as Kevin mentioned, amounted to just over $50 million. The new U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee was incurred for the first time in the quarter and amounted to $39 million. 
We also started to bear the cost of the new Puerto Rico excise tax. This is accounted for as an addition to our manufacturing costs. It's capitalized in inventory and expensed as the product is sold. In Q1, the costs amounted to around $13 million. 
The third category of cost increases in the quarter related to partnership costs, which amounted to around $60 million in total. The biggest component of this was an increase in Enbrel profit share payments to Pfizer as a consequence of the 9% reported growth for the product in the quarter. The balance primarily related to costs associated with our Kirin-Amgen partnership. 
Moving to net income. Net income was down 2%, and that benefited from some one-time gains realized from rebalancing our investment portfolio during the quarter. 
And then moving to the adjusted tax rate. You'll see, that was 16.6% compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax. Based on our recent notice issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we've assumed creditability of this excise tax on product manufactured for the U.S. market. As a result, our adjusted tax rate is lower by the amount of the foreign tax credit. While as outlined above, a significant proportion of the tax paid will be expensed in future periods when the product is sold out of inventory. 
On an annual basis, this will have a relatively small impact on our P&L, but the accounting treatment clearly drives timing differences within quarters. Excluding the impact to the Puerto Rico tax, our adjusted tax rate would've been 20.9%. 
Adjusted earnings per share at the bottom of the page grew 3%. And this benefited from share repurchases during 2010, and you'll note that average shares outstanding during the quarter were 5% lower compared to a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 6 and turning to the balance sheet. Our net cash position continued to strengthen in the quarter. Cash balances increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. In February and as planned, we also retired our $2.5 billion convertible bond. And consequently, we reduced our outstanding debt to $11.2 billion. So overall, our net cash balances were $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2010. 
During the quarter, on cash flows, we generated $900 million in free cash flow, and we didn't repurchase shares during this quarter. I'll talk more about our capital allocation plans tomorrow during the Business Review. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that in summary, we're reaffirming the guidance for 2011 that we communicated earlier this year. The only exception to this is the adjusted tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 15% to 16%. And again, this reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the newly enacted Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico impact, we still expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. And as outlined earlier, this is a credit against the tax charge and cost of sales, and it shouldn't have a material impact on net income or EPS for the year as a whole, even though there was some benefit during this quarter. Let me hand over to Bob for a brief commercial review."

On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first quarter. In particular, I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results and will be providing much more detail tomorrow.
As you can see, our global product sales grew by 3% versus 1% -- sorry, versus the first quarter of 2010, and this growth was driven primarily by several factors. In U.S., as we've already mentioned, Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered strong results with growth of 9% and 8% respectively, and that was driven primarily by a combination of price and unit demand. In the U.S., EPOGEN sales were down by $88 million or 14% during the quarter. This decline was due to a lower dose utilization driven by changes in the market arising from bundling. And I'll provide plenty of detail tomorrow on bundling, but in general, I wanted to note on this call that bundling is playing out pretty much as we expected when we talked to you in January, and we continue to believe that we'll see a mid-teens percent dose decline in 2011, which will be partially offset by patient population growth and by price. 
Aranesp sales were down 7% during the first quarter, with sales down 7% in the U.S. and 8% outside of the U.S. The implementation of REMS, which was finalized in the first quarter here in the U.S. had some impact on sales. And in Europe, the trends were influenced by some erosion in price and units, although our market share remained stable through the period internationally. 
Our newer products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA globally grew by $101 million or 34% on the quarter, and I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our launch products in particular, Prolia and XGEVA, to give you a bit more color on their performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 10, I have included a graph showing the cumulative syringes sold in the U.S., and that's represented in green on the slide. So as you can see in the U.S., growth is accelerating nicely. And to give you some sense of this, in 2010, it took us 6 months to generate sales of the first 30,000 syringes. And in the U.S. in 2011, we reached roughly that same number of syringes in half the time, including growth in March of 60% over the level that we achieved in February. 
Looking at the business in the U.S., we estimate that about 20% of our Prolia patients were treatment naive but obviously presented with multiple risk factors. The primary care community continues to represent the bulk of prescribing. On the quarter, it was about 2/3 of the prescribing physicians, and they are generating about 60% of the Prolia usage. And then, the second half of the year, we expect retail access through Part D, returning patients and the commencement of our DTC [direct-to-consumer] promotion to serve as catalysts for Prolia in the launch. And I'll provide, obviously, much more detail on that tomorrow. 
Turning now to XGEVA on Slide 11, with revenues of $42 million in its first full quarter since launch, we're very pleased with the broad uptake that we've seen so far. Looking at patients on XGEVA to date, in oncology clinics, 2/3 of our patients were previously treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate, primarily Zometa, of course, and the remaining 1/3 were new to treatment. All these patients, about half of them were breast cancer patients, followed by prostate and other solid tumors. The product is being used broadly in the oncology setting. 
With respect to prostate, three quarters of the XGEVA use has been provided in hospitals and oncology clinics, with the remaining quarter in urology clinics where we already have a very strong patient share of about 40%. The reimbursement landscape for XGEVA is very favorable. On the Medicare front, all Medicare carriers have confirmed coverage on Part B, and virtually all commercialized have coverage, with the vast majority of commercialized having no medical benefit restriction. So we'll cover, obviously, the outlook for XGEVA in greater detail tomorrow. Now let me turn to Roger who'll give you a brief update on R&D."

We've also invested in regulatory affairs and observational research as part of our commitment to international expansion. Going forward, again as Jon mentioned, we're paying close attention to our expense trajectory, and we've implemented a gated approach to investments that will ensure careful management of expenses in R&D. I'll leave most of the discussion of our pipeline progression to tomorrow's Business Review. However, I will make a few comments about our regulatory activities. 
First, we continue to have productive scientific discussions with the FDA aimed at improving the labels for erythropoietic stimulating agents. Our goal is to ensure that the risks associated with targeting high hemoglobin values in patients with chronic kidney disease are well articulated and placed in an appropriate context for patients not on dialysis and for dialysis patients as well. We're making good progress. 
The European regulatory review of XGEVA remains on track, as does the XGEVA review in other jurisdictions. As previously announced, we've appealed to the CHMP for reconsideration of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancers that contain unmutated KRAS genes. Review of this indication is also proceeding in the United States. 
During the first quarter, we announced that our Phase III study of Motesanib for the first line treatment of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, failed to meet its primary endpoint of improvement and overall survival. Many patients did, however, appear to benefit from the use of Motesanib in combination with traditional chemotherapy in this trial. Additional analyses of this very large data set are underway. 
And finally, in the first quarter, we made very substantial progress in advancing our Phase II pipeline including AMG 827 and AMG 785. I'll have a great deal more to say about this at the Business Review tomorrow. Kevin?"

And I know there's a lot of interest to hear more detail on XGEVA, and we'll share that with you in greater detail tomorrow. What I would say is that three quarters of our prostate patients who were receiving XGEVA are getting it from the hospital or the oncology clinics. The remaining quarter are getting it from urologists. So overall, urology is still very -- it's about 5% of sales of XGEVA in the first quarter. We have strong share amongst those urologists who are treating bone mets [metastasis], but there's clearly an opportunity for us to expand into a number of urology clinics that aren't presently treating those patients. So that's a snapshot that I hope is helpful for you today, but we'll go into plenty of detail tomorrow?"

We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is making good progress, and Enbrel and our Filgrastim franchise had a strong quarter. We also made very good progress on the pipeline. 
You will notice that operating expenses this quarter show a 13% increase compared to the first quarter of '10, amounting to an increase of about $260 million. This increase is unusual for Amgen, which has been and remains disciplined about having revenues lead expenses. I want to explain this difference. Jon will talk, as will Bob and Roger, a bit more about it. 
2011 is an investment year for Amgen, as we launch two new products in the United States and internationally and add additional support for our emerging pipeline. And as we transition 3 promising programs from Phase II to Phase III. These new costs in support of Prolia and XGEVA and additional R&D support amount to approximately $130 million of this expense increase. 
Secondly, approximately $50 million of the expenses are triggered by the first quarterly payment about the new Healthcare Reform Fee and the new Puerto Rico excise tax fee, neither of which was reflected in our Q1 '10 expenses. Finally, approximately $60 million of these new costs reflect higher Enbrel profit share triggered by strong first quarter Enbrel sales and a onetime adjustment in expenses associated with our Kirin-Amgen partnership agreements. As I mentioned, Jon and Roger will have more to say about this in a few minutes. 
Our 2011 investments and the new expenses I have described are incorporated in our 2011 guidance. A number of you have asked about Amgen's plans regarding payment of a dividend. We will cover Amgen's capital allocation plans, including dividends, in detail at our investor meeting tomorrow. Jon?"
24816,129221206,116230,"Amgen Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin.

So ahead of the broader review of the business tomorrow, I'll take a few minutes to walk through our results for the quarter and reinforce some of the comments just made by Kevin. 
So if you turn to Page 5 of the presentation deck. I'll walk through the P&L here with you. So in summary, we grew revenues to $3.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales later on the call. You'll also see that other revenues grew in the quarter by $24 million. This was due to a couple of items. First a milestone payment received from Astellas for the filing of AMG 223 in Japan. And secondly, recoveries on AMG 827 development costs from our partner Kirin-Amgen. 
Also as highlighted by Kevin, operating costs increased by 13% in the quarter compared to last year. You'll recall that we highlighted in our guidance for 2011 that R&D costs would be higher this year relative to 2010. As I'll outline tomorrow, we expect to maintain our investment level in R&D of between 18% and 20% of sales. Quarter 1 2010 costs at 17.5% of sales benefited from some onetime true-ups on XGEVA clinical trial costs. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we're investing in the full cost of the Phase III trials for AMG 386 and 479. And in addition, we've accelerated the marketing authorization approvals for several of our marketed products in international markets. As an indication of this, we've achieved 24 marketing authorization approvals over the most recent 12 months, 2x the number that we achieved in the prior period. So all of this contributed to an investment level of 19.4% of sales in the first quarter. 
Operating expenses also reflected the full cost of launching Prolia and XGEVA, neither of which were approved in the same period last year. In addition to these strategic investments in R&D and our launched products, which amounted in total to around $130 million, we faced some new legislative costs which, in total, as Kevin mentioned, amounted to just over $50 million. The new U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee was incurred for the first time in the quarter and amounted to $39 million. 
We also started to bear the cost of the new Puerto Rico excise tax. This is accounted for as an addition to our manufacturing costs. It's capitalized in inventory and expensed as the product is sold. In Q1, the costs amounted to around $13 million. 
The third category of cost increases in the quarter related to partnership costs, which amounted to around $60 million in total. The biggest component of this was an increase in Enbrel profit share payments to Pfizer as a consequence of the 9% reported growth for the product in the quarter. The balance primarily related to costs associated with our Kirin-Amgen partnership. 
Moving to net income. Net income was down 2%, and that benefited from some one-time gains realized from rebalancing our investment portfolio during the quarter. 
And then moving to the adjusted tax rate. You'll see, that was 16.6% compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax. Based on our recent notice issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we've assumed creditability of this excise tax on product manufactured for the U.S. market. As a result, our adjusted tax rate is lower by the amount of the foreign tax credit. While as outlined above, a significant proportion of the tax paid will be expensed in future periods when the product is sold out of inventory. 
On an annual basis, this will have a relatively small impact on our P&L, but the accounting treatment clearly drives timing differences within quarters. Excluding the impact to the Puerto Rico tax, our adjusted tax rate would've been 20.9%. 
Adjusted earnings per share at the bottom of the page grew 3%. And this benefited from share repurchases during 2010, and you'll note that average shares outstanding during the quarter were 5% lower compared to a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 6 and turning to the balance sheet. Our net cash position continued to strengthen in the quarter. Cash balances increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. In February and as planned, we also retired our $2.5 billion convertible bond. And consequently, we reduced our outstanding debt to $11.2 billion. So overall, our net cash balances were $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2010. 
During the quarter, on cash flows, we generated $900 million in free cash flow, and we didn't repurchase shares during this quarter. I'll talk more about our capital allocation plans tomorrow during the Business Review. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that in summary, we're reaffirming the guidance for 2011 that we communicated earlier this year. The only exception to this is the adjusted tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 15% to 16%. And again, this reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the newly enacted Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico impact, we still expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. And as outlined earlier, this is a credit against the tax charge and cost of sales, and it shouldn't have a material impact on net income or EPS for the year as a whole, even though there was some benefit during this quarter. Let me hand over to Bob for a brief commercial review."

On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first quarter. In particular, I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results and will be providing much more detail tomorrow.
As you can see, our global product sales grew by 3% versus 1% -- sorry, versus the first quarter of 2010, and this growth was driven primarily by several factors. In U.S., as we've already mentioned, Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered strong results with growth of 9% and 8% respectively, and that was driven primarily by a combination of price and unit demand. In the U.S., EPOGEN sales were down by $88 million or 14% during the quarter. This decline was due to a lower dose utilization driven by changes in the market arising from bundling. And I'll provide plenty of detail tomorrow on bundling, but in general, I wanted to note on this call that bundling is playing out pretty much as we expected when we talked to you in January, and we continue to believe that we'll see a mid-teens percent dose decline in 2011, which will be partially offset by patient population growth and by price. 
Aranesp sales were down 7% during the first quarter, with sales down 7% in the U.S. and 8% outside of the U.S. The implementation of REMS, which was finalized in the first quarter here in the U.S. had some impact on sales. And in Europe, the trends were influenced by some erosion in price and units, although our market share remained stable through the period internationally. 
Our newer products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia and XGEVA globally grew by $101 million or 34% on the quarter, and I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our launch products in particular, Prolia and XGEVA, to give you a bit more color on their performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 10, I have included a graph showing the cumulative syringes sold in the U.S., and that's represented in green on the slide. So as you can see in the U.S., growth is accelerating nicely. And to give you some sense of this, in 2010, it took us 6 months to generate sales of the first 30,000 syringes. And in the U.S. in 2011, we reached roughly that same number of syringes in half the time, including growth in March of 60% over the level that we achieved in February. 
Looking at the business in the U.S., we estimate that about 20% of our Prolia patients were treatment naive but obviously presented with multiple risk factors. The primary care community continues to represent the bulk of prescribing. On the quarter, it was about 2/3 of the prescribing physicians, and they are generating about 60% of the Prolia usage. And then, the second half of the year, we expect retail access through Part D, returning patients and the commencement of our DTC [direct-to-consumer] promotion to serve as catalysts for Prolia in the launch. And I'll provide, obviously, much more detail on that tomorrow. 
Turning now to XGEVA on Slide 11, with revenues of $42 million in its first full quarter since launch, we're very pleased with the broad uptake that we've seen so far. Looking at patients on XGEVA to date, in oncology clinics, 2/3 of our patients were previously treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate, primarily Zometa, of course, and the remaining 1/3 were new to treatment. All these patients, about half of them were breast cancer patients, followed by prostate and other solid tumors. The product is being used broadly in the oncology setting. 
With respect to prostate, three quarters of the XGEVA use has been provided in hospitals and oncology clinics, with the remaining quarter in urology clinics where we already have a very strong patient share of about 40%. The reimbursement landscape for XGEVA is very favorable. On the Medicare front, all Medicare carriers have confirmed coverage on Part B, and virtually all commercialized have coverage, with the vast majority of commercialized having no medical benefit restriction. So we'll cover, obviously, the outlook for XGEVA in greater detail tomorrow. Now let me turn to Roger who'll give you a brief update on R&D."

As Jon mentioned, R&D expenses in the quarter increased by 14% reflecting investments in Prolia, XGEVA and Neulasta, as well as clinical trial expenses associated with the initiation of Phase III studies of AMG 386 and AMG 479. We've also invested in regulatory affairs and observational research as part of our commitment to international expansion. Going forward, again as Jon mentioned, we're paying close attention to our expense trajectory, and we've implemented a gated approach to investments that will ensure careful management of expenses in R&D. I'll leave most of the discussion of our pipeline progression to tomorrow's Business Review. However, I will make a few comments about our regulatory activities. 
First, we continue to have productive scientific discussions with the FDA aimed at improving the labels for erythropoietic stimulating agents. Our goal is to ensure that the risks associated with targeting high hemoglobin values in patients with chronic kidney disease are well articulated and placed in an appropriate context for patients not on dialysis and for dialysis patients as well. We're making good progress. 
The European regulatory review of XGEVA remains on track, as does the XGEVA review in other jurisdictions. As previously announced, we've appealed to the CHMP for reconsideration of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancers that contain unmutated KRAS genes. Review of this indication is also proceeding in the United States. 
During the first quarter, we announced that our Phase III study of Motesanib for the first line treatment of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, failed to meet its primary endpoint of improvement and overall survival. Many patients did, however, appear to benefit from the use of Motesanib in combination with traditional chemotherapy in this trial. Additional analyses of this very large data set are underway. 
And finally, in the first quarter, we made very substantial progress in advancing our Phase II pipeline including AMG 827 and AMG 785. I'll have a great deal more to say about this at the Business Review tomorrow. Kevin?"

I know that we speak to you today in an environment, a macro environment of substantial uncertainty and the markets understandably reflect that uncertainty. However, when I focus on our business, I see progress on literally all fronts. We'll go over that progress today in each of our separate comments. But I want to reflect back on our last conversation, April 21, when we shared our business plan and our guidance through 2015. That was just a few months ago, but many things have happened since then. And I want to reiterate my conviction about that 2015 guidance and the various business elements that we outlined in building up our conviction around why we will deliver those numbers or better. 
We had some uncertainties that day that are not uncertainties any longer. We'll talk about that in depth today. I know that you are interested in and I understand why our ESA business, particularly EPOGEN, we're prepared to discuss that in depth. And while there's still a few uncertainties in the EPOGEN business compared to what I was thinking and seeing on April 21, I feel much more clarity around how that business will move going forward. Bob will share that with you. 
I also want to point to the 8% product sales growth year-over-year, significant numbers and I'm proud of the effort behind that, and I'm optimistic about what it foretells for the future. We are also making the commentary given these results, but we expect our guidance for 2011 to be at the top end of the range. So when I look at Amgen today, I feel great optimism and confidence about the future. And I want to thank all of the Amgen staff, I know many of whom are on this call for their tremendous effort in delivering these great results this quarter and everything I know they'll do for patients and shareholders going forward. 
So I'd like now to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Peacock who'll give you a more in-depth briefing on our financials and strategy. Jonathan?"
24816,136585628,148712,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, u",849,"Thanks, Kevin. So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. 
Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, up 8%, driven by good performance across our portfolio, particularly from EPOGEN, Neulasta and Enbrel. Bob will talk more about this in a few minutes. 
Other revenues were down by $125 million if you see a sudden milestone payments received in 2010 from GSK for Prolia approvals in Europe and from Takeda for the Vectibix approval in Japan. 
You'll see that operating expenses grew 15% or $329 million in the quarter. This included $47 million for the new Healthcare Reform fee. $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes recorded in cost of sales and to which we receive an offsetting foreign tax credit in our federal income taxes. And also $40 million increase in profit share payments to Pfizer as a result of higher Enbrel sales. 
Of the remaining increase of just under $200 million, $166 million, more than 80% related to the increase in research and development spending in the quarter.
So the comments on this in setting our guidance for the year, we highlighted 2011 as an investment year for our research and development activities. This reflected the planned transition of several molecules from Phase I to Phase III and the resources needed to support our marketed products internationally. 
Consistent with this close to 50% of the increase in the second quarter is driven by the cost associated with several new late stage programs, particularly the Phase III trials for AMG 386, 479 and OncoVEX. The balance is driven by increased support for our marketed products, including Prolia and XGEVA and several of our established products in international markets. 
Discovery research in our early pipeline also drove a small increase. At our business review in April as Kevin referenced, we provided guidance that we expect R&D in each of the next 5 years to fall in the range of 18% to 20% of product sales. For 2011, we expect to be within the high end of this range. And with this in mind, we'll continue to make choices about which programs to take forward and to closely scrutinize the efficiency of the spend within each project. You may recall that in April, we highlighted several projects where decisions have been made to substantially reduce or terminate planned investments, as a result of reviewing the latest program milestones.
Moving to cost of sales. As I mentioned earlier, this includes $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes. If we exclude this charge, cost of sales would have been 13.5%, an improvement of 1.7% compared to 2010. This reflects much better utilization of our network, as a result of restructuring actions that we've taken over the last 2 years. 
The tax rate in the quarter benefited from the foreign tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. And this is partially offset by the impact of the nondeductible Healthcare Reform fee. Net income therefore declined 3% in the quarter and EPS declined slightly year-on-year from 138 to 137. You may recall in setting our guidance for the year, our stated objective was to increase EPS before the impact of the health reform fee. Adjusting for the fee in the second quarter, EPS grew 3%. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet on Page 6. Our cash balances grew by $4.7 billion compared to June 30, 2010. This is also an increase of $3.8 billion from March 31 of this year, driven by our bond issue of 3-point -- of $3 billion in June. Free cash flows of $1.4 billion offset by share repurchases and the Bergamo acquisition. 
Our debt outstanding is now $14.2 billion, resulting in a net cash balance of $5 billion. The bond issue in the quarter was consistent with capital plan that we presented in April, and we achieved coupons of 2.3%, 4.1% and 565 on the 510 and 31 year maturities respectively. 
During the quarter, total share repurchases amounted to $700 million at an average price of 5687. We also announced today our first dividend for the quarter at $0.28 with a payment date of September 8, for all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18. And consistent with our guidance in April, we expect to return an average of 60% of net income each year to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. But the amount may be higher or lower on individual years. 
Finally, we are updating our guidance for the full year on Page 7 for both revenues and adjusted EPS.
We now expect revenues and adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of the current ranges of 15.1% to $15.5 billion and $5 to $5.20 per share respectively. Guidance on the other metrics outside of Page 7 remained the same. Let me hand over to Bob to give more update on the product sales performance. Bob?"

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of global commercial performance for the second quarter. And as noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 8% versus the second quarter of 2010 reflecting momentum in each of our pro",1162,"Okay. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of global commercial performance for the second quarter. And as noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 8% versus the second quarter of 2010 reflecting momentum in each of our product categories except the essays. Excluding ESA, revenues grew 18% during the quarter. I'll review the business starting with Filgrastim. Our Filgrastim products grew 13% during the quarter. In the U.S., Filgrastim was up by 15% driven by the new pact demand and to a lesser degree, price. Roughly half of the unit demand growth was from increase per cycle penetration particularly with newer or milder suppressive chemotherapy regimens. The remaining you might demand growth was driven by the timing of customer orders. 
And goes 9% was driven primarily be price and unit demand or unit demand increases were driven largely by overall segment growth which was in the mid-teens on the year-over-year basis for both room and 2011. Enbrel remains the market leader in both of these segments as of the end of second quarter. 
Now turning to EPOGEN. Although our EPOGEN sales declined by $114 million or 17% versus the same quarter last year, sales were actually up by $8 million or 1% versus the first quarter of 2011, an indication that our sales largely stabilized in the wake of bundling. We have previously stated that we expected a mid-teens percentage decline in dose for EPOGEN in 2011 due to bundling and that this impact will be concentrated in the first half of the year. 
The implementation of new protocols occurred a bit more rapidly than we expected, but dose stabilized just where we expected it would be. 
Now with a new label into proposed QIP changes, we now expect year-over-year dose decline to be in the range of 20% to 25% and that of course will be partially offset by patient population growth and price increases. And I should stress that this range I just given you assumes that QIP is finalized as proposed. 
Based on our experience with implementation of the bundled payment system, we think much of the impact will be realized in 2011, with some residual impact early in 2012. At that point, we believe practice changes would've been largely implemented by dialysis providers. 
Our expectations regarding the impacted label in reimbursement changes are largely informed by our extensive discussions with the nephrology committee and our understanding of the relationship across dose, hemoglobin, the sub-10 population and the risk of transfusion. 
Through April, the mean hemoglobin level was about 11.2 grams per deciliter in the U.S. and about 12% of the patients had hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter. Now as the mean hemoglobin decreases for dialysis patients, the sub-10 population will inevitably increase. So if the mean hemoglobin level will decrease, for example, to 10.5 grams per deciliter, then the sub-10 population would approximately triple and we would expect to see considerably more transfusions as a result. The last time we saw hemoglobin levels below 10 was back in 1993, and we do not think positions will accept to return the treatment of paradigm in place nearly 20 years ago. To put this in a global context, the mean hemoglobin in the U.K. was 11.3 grams per deciliter in the fourth quarter of last year and that's true across the big Western European markets outside of U.K. as well and in Canada, the mean hemoglobin was about 10.8 grams per deciliter earlier this year. So our expectation is that hemoglobin levels will decline from the current 11.2, but will remain above 10 grams per deciliter in the dialysis setting. During the 60-day comment period, we will be submitting our response to the proposed QIP and we believe that the current sub-10 quality indicator should be maintained.
We'll be monitoring developments on this front and of course we'll keep you updated as events play out. 
Turning now to Aranesp. Aranesp sales declined 3% during the second quarter, with sales down 10% in the U.S. Aranesp will also be impacted by the recent ESA label changes primarily related to CRI. However, as we discussed in our business review, pre-dialysis represented about $200 million of our U.S. sales in 2010. 
Shifting to Prolia now. In the U.S., Prolia grew 70% versus the first quarter of 2011. We are making steady progress on a number of fronts. Through the second quarter, over 70,000 patients have received Prolia in the U.S. as we discussed in our business review, we planned to have part D coverage with affordable access which means less than $100 per 6 months of treatment in place for 11 million lives by the end of the second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we secured access for more than 11 million lives by June 30. 
We expect catalyst in the second half for Prolia, including increased access through part D, returning patients in incremental patient awareness as a result of our print advertising. 
Now turning to XGEVA. XGEVA was up 74% versus the first quarter of '11 and through the second quarter, more than 30,000 patients have been treated with XGEVA, representing rapid adoption of the product by oncologist and neurologist since our launch at the very end of last year. Importantly, we've seen solid share gains and overall segment growth. 
XGEVA ended the quarter with unit share of about 20% and we are as we observed declines in the SRE segment prior to the launch of XGEVA, we are now experiencing mid single-digit growth. Clearly, XGEVA growth will rely on taking share from IV. And as we discussed in our business review, XGEVA growth will also rely on increasing the length of treatment due to improved renal tolerability and the ease of administration, as well as addressing the 200-plus thousand cancer patients with bone metastases who are not currently treated. The segment growth I cited gives us confidence that we are making progress on both fronts. 
I'd like to note that all of our products in the U.S. ended the quarter with wholesale inventories in the normal ranges. Now let me turn to the International business. 
Second quarter was a record or us internationally. Sales grew in all countries, except Spain. We maintained share against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia to maintain double-digit growth rates and we are pleased with the recent positive opinion from the CHMP for an expanded label for Vectibix. 
Internationally, Prolia experienced steady growth would now launch in market comprising 40% of the sales opportunity internationally. And over the balance of the year, we hope to launch an additional key markets, including Italy and Spain. We're also excited about the recent marketing authorization for XGEVA in Europe, which Roger will have more to say about in a moment. 
In summary, we are pleased with a solid growth about our core franchises, particularly and the ongoing successful expansion of our international operations. Roger?"

Tur",838,"Thanks, Bob. The second quarter saw the approval of XGEVA in Canada and Europe submission of our SBLA for bone metastasis prevention in men with castrate and continue progress in enrolling key clinical trials and advancing important research projects. Turning to Slide 11. As most of you know, we completed discussions with the FDA leading to modification of the U.S. Prescribing Information for every 2 pieces stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. The label incorporates information from our TREAT study which we've discussed previously and focuses attention on the newly identified risk of the ESA therapy while confirming the benefits that are well-known to physicians and to patients suffering from anemia resulting from renal disease. 
For Prolia, we had the opportunity earlier this week to see top-line data from our Phase III study evaluating the ability of administered dose of 60 milligrams 176 months to improve bone mineral density in men with low bone mass. The study met its primary and all secondary endpoints. An initial look at the safety database indicates that the findings are consistent with what we've seen in other populations. There were no new safety signals. We expect to submit the results of this study to regulatory agencies with the goal of expanding availability of Prolia therapy to men, as well as women with osteoporosis. 
As I've mentioned earlier, we perceive marketing authorization in Europe for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events and adults with bone metastasis from solid tumors. Also at the end of the second quarter, we submitted an SBLA to the FDA based on our favorable results from the 147 study which were presented earlier this year. And these results demonstrated a reduced risk of bone metastases in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for these events. We expect to hear more from the FDA before the end of the third quarter regarding this review. 
Also as Bob mentioned, the committee on human medicinal products of the European Medicines Agency has recommended that Vectibix will be approved for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the first and second line setting. As we previously noted, only patients whose tumors contain wild type that is unmutated KRAS genes should receive Vectibix therapy. In the United States, we've just received Complete Response Letters related to the same indication. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies, but requested an updated safety analysis and additional analysis of overall survival in the 181 and 203 studies using more mature data sets. Our combination diagnostic device for KRAS gene status which we've developed in collaboration with Kyogen must also gain regulatory approval. 
As noted on the slide, we've recently changed the U.S. Prescribing Information for Nplate to make plain the treatment of patients with humble site associated with the myelodysplastic syndromes is not indicated. You will recall that Nplate is a probably been receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of low platelet counts in patients with immune to was I think panic or IPP. The FDA has informed us that they intend to modify our Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or REMS to eliminate the restricted distribution component. In addition, to reduce the health care practitioners, the agency will no longer require that prescribers to complete clinical assessment forms as part of the REMS. We're working closely with agency to ensure that patients and physicians will remain well-informed about the appropriate use of Nplate.
Turning now to new programs and development, I'm pleased to report that they based the critical study of OncoVEX with for the treatment of stage 3 informative volume a you recall that this trial is being conducted under an FDA-agreed Special Protocol Assessment with the primary endpoint of durable clinical response. Separately we have decided not to proceed with the OncoVEX Phase III to the of the head and neck. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that head and neck cancers associated with prior human Papilloma virus infection behave very differently from tumors with other radiology. These observations mandate that clinical trials ensure appropriate balance representation of subject with prior Papilloma virus infection. Since the changes in clinical trial design required a quite significant, we've elected to the current study and to initiate a redesign trial at a later time. Obviously, our new approach to new indications for OncoVEX GM-CSF will take into account what we have learned through the comeback of our melanoma trial. 
Finally, those of you who followed our quarterly summaries will know that there is typically an underlying seasonality to our expense profile. Ordinarily, expenses increased later in the year. In 2011 however, we planned for early investments in key clinical trials. It is our intention to flatten the trajectory of R&D spending in Q3 and Q4 substantially. And as Jon noted, despite the increase in expenditures that we have seen in the first half of 2011, we expect R&D expense for the year as a whole to fall within our guidance of 20% of sales. Kevin?"

It's consist in what they've said all along. Certainly, we'll have a robust biosimilar environment in the United States, hard to predict exactly when hard to predict how many. But I'd like to just reiterate that the biosimilar environment commercially is nothing like the generic pill situation. Companies have to invest in clinical trials. They have to invest in manufacturing. They have to actually sell the product. They have to have regulatory capability, et cetera, et cetera. So this is a competitive environment. I expect that the players will be commercially rational and their shareholders will demand that they earn a good return and so I think it will be kind of like a normal business if you will with their multiple competitors. We have experience in this. We will be smart, tenacious and I believe effective competitors in the United States is as we have been in Europe.

I hesitate to answer a question in the context of some of the companies you just named. But I respect that they're doing their best and in some cases have had some success in reshaping their businesses. But I'd like to state that they are coming from a very, very different place than we. We have always been and will remain an absolute pure play focused human therapeutics company. In classical business sense, I understand your question. However, we have analyzed that question and I'd like to make a few points. First of all, despite the challenges this business has provide, just presented to us and shareholders for the last 5 years, it remains a very large contributor to revenues and importantly income. Secondly, there are going to be at least the United States dialysis business 300,000-plus patients were really, really need this medicine going forward and they're going to need it for as long as they are on dialysis. That is not going to change. And so it would be kind of the horse has already left the barn a little bit at this point to make that move. There are also issues around taxes, operating and another legal and operational issues. So we are not wedded to any given business. We are in business. We're in business to serve patients and shareholders. Our judgment is right now that we best serve patients and shareholders by managing this business well. But I want to assure shareholders that we are not wedded to any given business and we do evaluate properly with outside health our strategic alternatives. So it's not a crazy question and we have thought hard about it, but I think we can see what this business is going to look like. It's fully in our 2015 guidance and actually compared to what I was thinking about April 21, strange as it may seem for you all to hear, I feel quite a bit comforted by where we are now and our visibility and certainty about the future. So good question and we do look at that question."

I know that we speak to you today in an environment, a macro environment, of substantial uncertainty and the markets understandably reflect that uncertainty. However, when I focus on our business, I see progress on literally all fronts. We'll go over that progress today in each of our separate comments. But I want to reflect back on our last conversation, April 21, when we shared our business plan and our guidance through 2015. That was just a few months ago, but many things have happened since then. And I want to reiterate my conviction about that 2015 guidance and the various business elements that we outlined in building up our conviction around why we will deliver those numbers or better. 
We had some uncertainties that day that are not uncertainties any longer. We'll talk about that in depth today. I know that you are interested in, and I understand why, our ESA business particularly EPOGEN. We're prepared to discuss that in depth. And while there's still a few uncertainties in the EPOGEN business compared to what I was thinking and seeing on April 21, I feel much more clarity around how that business will move going forward. Bob will share that with you. 
I also want to point to the 8% product sales growth year-over-year, significant numbers and I'm proud of the effort behind that, and I'm optimistic about what it foretells for the future. We're also making the commentary, given these results, that we expect our guidance for 2011 to be at the top end of the range. So when I look at Amgen today, I feel great optimism and confidence about the future. And I want to thank all of the Amgen staff, I know many of whom are on this call, for their tremendous effort in delivering these great results this quarter and everything I know they'll do for patients and shareholders going forward. 
So I'd like now to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Peacock who'll give you, a more in-depth briefing on our financials and strategy. Jonathan?"

So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, u",847,"Thanks, Kevin. So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. 
Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, up 8%, driven by good performance across our portfolio, particularly from NEUPOGEN, Neulasta and Enbrel. Bob will talk more about this in a few minutes. 
Other revenues were down by $125 million due to certain milestone payments received in 2010 from GSK for Prolia approvals in Europe and from Takeda for the Vectibix approval in Japan. 
You'll see that operating expenses grew 15% or $329 million in, the quarter. This included $47 million for the new Healthcare Reform fee; $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes recorded in cost of sales and for which, we received an offsetting foreign tax credit in our federal income taxes; and also $40 million increase in profit share payments to Pfizer as a result of higher Enbrel sales. Of the remaining increase of just under $200 million, $166 million, more than 80%, relates to the increase in research and development spending in the quarter.
So to comment on this, in setting our guidance for the year, we highlighted 2011 as an investment year for our research and development activities. This reflected the planned transition of several molecules from Phase II to Phase III and the resources needed to support our marketed products internationally. Consistent with this, close to 50% of the increase in the second quarter is driven by the costs associated with several new late-stage programs, particularly the Phase III trials for AMG 386, 479 and OncoVEX. The balance is driven by increased support for our marketed products, including Prolia and XGEVA and several of our established products in international markets.  Discovery research in our early pipeline also drove a small increase. 
At our business review in April, as Kevin referenced, we provided guidance that we expect R&D in each of the next 5 years to fall in the range of 18% to 20% of product sales. For 2011, we expect to be within the high end of this range. And with this in mind, we'll continue to make choices about which program to take forward and to closely scrutinize the efficiency of the spend within each project. You may recall that in April, we highlighted several projects where decisions have been made to substantially reduce or terminate planned investments, as a result of reviewing the latest program milestones.
Moving to cost of sales. As I mentioned earlier, this includes $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes. If we exclude this charge, cost of sales would have been 13.5%, an improvement of 1.7% compared to 2010. This reflects much better utilization of our network, as a result of these restructuring actions that we've taken over the last 2 years. 
The tax rate in the quarter benefited from the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. And this is partially offset by the impact of the nondeductible Healthcare Reform fee. Net income therefore declined 3% in the quarter and EPS declined slightly year-on-year from $1.38 to $1.37. You may recall in setting our guidance for the year, our stated objective was to increase EPS before the impact of the Health Reform fee. Adjusting for the fee in the second quarter, EPS grew 3%. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet on Page 6. Our cash balances grew by $4.7 billion compared to June 30, 2010. This is also an increase of $3.8 billion from March 31 of this year, driven by our bond issue of 3-point -- of $3 billion in June, free cash flows of $1.4 billion offset by share repurchases and the Bergamo acquisition. Our debt outstanding is now $14.2 billion, resulting in a net cash balance of $5 billion. The bond issue in the quarter was consistent with capital plan that we presented in April, and we achieved coupons of 2.3%, 4.1% and 5.65% on the 5-, 10- and 31-year maturities respectively. 
During the quarter, total share repurchases amounted to $700 million at an average price of $56.87. We also announced today our first dividend for the quarter at $0.28 with a payment date of September 8 for all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18. And consistent with our guidance in April, we expect to return an average of 60% of net income each year to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. But the amount may be higher or lower in individual years.  
Finally, we're updating our guidance for the full year on Page 7 for both revenues and adjusted EPS.  We now expect revenues and adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of the current ranges of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion and $5 to $5.20 per share respectively. Guidance on the other metrics outlined on Page 7 remained the same. 
Let me hand over to Bob to give more update on the product sales performance. Bob?"

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of Global Commercial performance for the second quarter.

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of Global Commercial performance for the second quarter. And as noted in our press release, our Global Product sales grew by 8% versus the second quarter of 2010, reflecting momentum in each of our product categories except ESAs. Excluding ESAs, revenues grew 18% during the quarter. 
I'll review the business starting with Filgrastim. Our Filgrastim products grew 15% during the quarter. In the U.S., Filgrastim was up by 15% driven by Neulasta unit demand and to a lesser degree, price. Roughly 1/2 of the unit demand growth was from increased first-cycle penetration, particularly with newer, more myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. The remaining unit demand growth was driven by the timing of customer orders. 
Enbrel's 9% growth during the quarter was driven primarily by price and unit demand. Unit demand increases were driven largely by overall segment growth which was in the mid-teens on the year-over-year basis for both rheum and derm in 2011. Enbrel remains the market leader in both of these segments as of the end of second quarter. 
Now turning to EPOGEN. Although our EPOGEN sales declined by $114 million or 17% versus the same quarter last year, sales were actually up by $8 million or 1% versus the first quarter of 2011, an indication that our sales largely stabilized in the wake of bundling. We had previously stated that we expected a mid-teens percentage decline in dose for EPOGEN in 2011 due to bundling and that this impact would be concentrated in the first half of the year. The implementation of new protocols occurred a bit more rapidly than we expected but dose stabilized just about where we expected it would be. Now with the new label and the proposed QIP changes, we now expect year-over-year dose decline to be in the range of 20% to 25% and that, of course, will be partially offset by patient population growth and price increases. And I should stress that this range I just given you assumes that QIP is finalized as proposed. 
Based on our experience with implementation of the bundled payment system, we think much of the impact will be realized in 2011, with some residual impact early in 2012. At that point, we believe practice changes will have been largely implemented by dialysis providers. 
Our expectations regarding the impact of label and reimbursement changes are largely informed by our extensive discussions with the nephrology community and our understanding of the relationship across dose, hemoglobin, the sub-10 population and the risk of transfusion. 
Through April, the mean hemoglobin level was about 11.2 grams per deciliter in the U.S., and about 12% of the patients had hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter. Now as the mean hemoglobin decreases for dialysis patients, the sub-10 population will inevitably increase. So if the mean hemoglobin level were to decrease, for example, to 10.5 grams per deciliter, then the sub-10 population would approximately triple, and we would expect to see considerably more transfusions as a result. The last time we saw hemoglobin levels below 10 was back in 1993, and we do not think physicians s will accept the return to the treatment paradigm in place nearly 20 years ago. To put this in a global context, the mean hemoglobin in the U.K. was 11.3 grams per deciliter in the fourth quarter of last year and that's true across the big Western European markets outside of the U.K. as well and in Canada, the mean hemoglobin was about 10.8 grams per deciliter earlier this year. So our expectation is that hemoglobin levels will decline from the current 11.2 but will remain above 10 grams per deciliter in the dialysis setting. During the 60-day comment period, we will be submitting our response to the proposed QIP, and we believe that the current sub-10 quality indicator should be maintained. We'll be monitoring developments on this front and, of course, we'll keep you updated as events play out. 
Turning now to Aranesp. Aranesp sales declined 3% during the second quarter, with sales down 10% in the U.S. Aranesp will also be impacted by the recent ESA label changes primarily related to CRI. However, as we discussed at our Business Review, pre-dialysis represented about $200 million of our U.S. sales in 2010. 
Shifting to Prolia now. In the U.S., Prolia grew 70% versus the first quarter of 2011. We're making steady progress on a number of fronts. Through the second quarter, over 70,000 patients have received Prolia in the U.S. As we discussed in our Business review, we planned to have part D coverage with affordable access, which means less than $100 per 6 months of treatment in place for 11 million lives by the end of the second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we secured access for more than 11 million lives by June 30. We expect catalysts in the second half for Prolia, including increased access through part D, returning patients in incremental patient awareness as a result of our print advertising. 
Now turning to XGEVA. XGEVA was up 74% versus the first quarter of 2011 and through the second quarter, more than 30,000 patients have been treated with XGEVA, representing rapid adoption of the product by oncologists and neurologists since our launch at the very end of last year. Importantly, we've seen solid share gains and overall segment growth. XGEVA ended the quarter with unit share of about 20%, and whereas we observed declines in the SRE segment prior to the launch of XGEVA, we are now experiencing mid single-digit growth. Clearly, XGEVA growth will rely on taking share from IV bisphosphonates. And as we discussed at our Business Review, XGEVA growth will also rely on increasing the length of treatment due to the improved renal tolerability and the ease of administration, as well as addressing the 200-plus thousand cancer patients with bone metastases who are not currently treated. The segment growth I cited gives us confidence that we're making progress on both fronts. 
I'd like to note that all of our products in the U.S. ended the quarter with wholesaler inventories in their normal ranges. 
And now let me turn to the International business.  Second quarter was a record or us internationally. Sales grew in all countries except Spain. We maintained share against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia maintained ouble-digit growth rates, and we are pleased with the recent positive opinion from the CHMP for an expanded label for Vectibix. 
Internationally, Prolia experienced steady growth. We've now launched in markets comprising 40% of the sales opportunity internationally. And over the balance of the year, we hope to launch an additional key markets, including Italy and Spain. We're also excited about the recent marketing authorization for XGEVA in Europe, which Roger will have more to say about in a moment. 
In summary, we're pleased with the solid growth of our core franchises, particularly Enbrel and Filgrastim, and the ongoing successful expansion of our international operations. Roger?"

The second quarter saw the approval of XGEVA in Canada and Europe, submission of our sBLA for bone metastasis prevention in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and continue progress in enrolling key clinical trials and advancing important research projects. 
Turning to Slide 11. As most of you know, we completed discussions with the FDA leading to modification of the U.S. Prescribing Information for erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. The label incorporates information from our TREAT study, which we've discussed previously, and focuses attention on the newly identified risk of ESA therapy while confirming the benefits that are well-known to physicians and to patients suffering from anemia resulting from renal disease. 
For Prolia, we had the opportunity earlier this week to see top-line data from our Phase III study, evaluating the ability of Denosumab administered at a dose of 60 milligrams once every 6 months to improve bone mineral density in men with low bone mass. The study met its primary and all secondary endpoints. An initial look at the safety database indicates that the findings are consistent with what we've seen in other populations. There were no new safety signals. We expect to submit the results of this study to regulatory agencies with the goal of expanding availability of the Prolia therapy to men, as well as women, with osteoporosis. 
As is mentioned earlier, we've received marketing authorization in Europe for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events in adults with bone metastasis from solid tumors. Also at the end of the second quarter, we submitted an sBLA to the FDA based on our favorable results from the 147 study, which were presented earlier this year. And these results demonstrated a reduced risk of bone metastases in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for these events. We expect to hear more from the FDA before the end of the third quarter regarding this review. 
Also, as Bob mentioned, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency has recommended that Vectibix be approved for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the first- and second-line setting. As we've previously noted, only patients whose tumors contain wild-type, that is unmutated KRAS genes, should receive Vectibix therapy. In the United States, we've just received Complete Response Letters related to the same indication. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies but requested an updated safety analysis and additional analysis of overall survival in the 181 and 203 studies using more mature data sets. Our combination diagnostic device for KRAS gene status, which we've developed in collaboration with Kyogen, must also gain regulatory approval. 
As noted on the slide, we've recently changed the U.S. Prescribing Information for Nplate to make plain that treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia associated with the myelodysplastic syndrome is not indicated. You will recall that Nplate is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of low platelet counts in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP. The FDA has informed us that they intend to modify our Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to eliminate the restricted distribution component. In addition, to reduce the burden on health care practitioners, the Agency will no longer require that prescribers complete clinical assessment forms as part of the REMS. We're working closely with the Agency to ensure that patients and physicians remain well-informed about the appropriate use of Nplate.
Turning now to new programs and development. I'm pleased to report that the Phase III clinical study of OncoVEX GM-CSF for the treatment of  stage 3, 4 malignant melanoma has completed enrollment. You will recall that this trial is being conducted under an FDA-agreed Special Protocol Assessment with the primary endpoint of durable clinical response. And separately, we have decided not to proceed with the OncoVEX GM-CSF Phase III program in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Recent studies have demonstrated that head and neck cancers associated with prior Human papillomavirus infection behave very differently from tumors with other etiologies. These observations mandate that clinical trials ensure appropriate balance in the representation of subjects with prior papillomavirus infection. Since the changes in clinical trial design required were quite significant, we've elected to halt the current study and to initiate a redesign trial at a later time. Obviously, our approach to new indications for OncoVEX GM-CSF will take into account what we have learned through the conduct of our melanoma trial. 
Finally, those of you who followed our quarterly summaries will know that there is typically an underlying seasonality to our expense profile. Ordinarily, expenses increase later in the year. In 2011, however, we planned for early investments in key clinical trials. It is our intention to flatten the trajectory of R&D spending in Q3 and Q4 substantially. And as Jon noted, despite the increase in expenditures that we've seen in the first half of 2011, we expect R&D expense for the year as a whole to fall within our guidance of 20% of sales.

Specifically, in light of what Roger said about R&D spending, you've taken up the revenue guidance, that implies, at least from my math, a little bit of upside to where people are modeling and some continued growth. But if you do the one-half '11 versus two-half 11 earnings, there seems to be a step down. So, I guess, the question is, is there some implied expenditure besides R&D that's baked into that?

Certainly, we'll have a robust biosimilar environment in the United States, hard to predict exactly when, hard to predict how many.

Companies have to invest in clinical trials, they have to invest in manufacturing, they have to actually sell the product, they have to have regulatory capability, et cetera, et cetera. So this is a competitive environment. I expect that the players will be commercially rational and their shareholders will demand that they earn a good return. And so I think it will be kind of like a normal business, if you will, with their multiple competitors. We have experience in this. We will be smart, tenacious and I believe effective competitors in the United States just as we have been in Europe. I'd rather not try to speculate at this moment on exactly what the prices are.

I hesitate to answer a question in the context of some of the companies you just named. But I respect that they're doing their best and in some cases, have had some success in reshaping their businesses. But I'd like to state that they're coming from a very, very different place than we. We have always been, and will remain, an absolute pure-play-focused human therapeutics company. In classical business sense, I understand your question. However, we have analyzed that question and I'd like to make a few points. First of all, despite the challenges this business has provide, presented to us and shareholders over the last 5 years, it remains a very large contributor to revenues and importantly, income. Secondly, there are going to be, at least the United States, some dialysis business, 300,000-plus patients who really, really need this medicine going forward and they're going to need it for as long as they're on dialysis. That is not going to change. And so it would be kind of the horse has already left the barn a little bit at this point to make that move. There are also issues around taxes, operating and another legal and operational issues. So we're not wedded to any given business. We are in business. We're in business to serve patients and shareholders. Our judgment is, right now, that we best serve patients and shareholders by managing this business well. But I want to assure shareholders that we are not wedded to any given business and we do evaluate properly with outside help our strategic alternatives. So it's not a crazy question, we have thought hard about it, but I think we can see what this business is going to look like. It's fully in our 2015 guidance. And actually compared to what I was thinking about April 21, strange as this may seem for you all to hear, I feel quite a bit comforted by where we are now and our visibility and certainty about the future. So good question, and we do look at that question."

We know there's a very large segment of the population that isn't being treated, and so we're doing all we can to try to grow the market as well to continue to take share with what we believe is a superior product. Prolia, as I said in April and repeated today, we're pleased with the foundation that we've built. We're pleased with the momentum we have. We think there are catalysts for the second half, so we're expecting to see a continued acceleration from Prolia in the second half. And on you're second question about Enbrel and Neulasta. An, important question, again, were pleased that Enbrel remains the market leader in both rheumatology and dermatology, but as your question reflects, there is competition. We now face 7 biologic competitors in the anti-TNF arena, and so the market is growing rapidly. We're growing with that market, and we're doing all we can to continue to see that patients that would benefit from the long safety and efficacy track record of Enbrel have access and opportunity to use the product. So we're encouraged by the trends we see, but we recognize there's a lot of competition for Enbrel. And on NEUPOGEN and Neulasta, again, worldwide, we're pleased with the volume growth that we saw, particularly for Neulasta. We recognize that there are newer myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens that are being used increasingly, and we're benefiting from per-cycle penetration of those newer regimens. And so as those continue to grow, as use of those regimens continues grow, I think there remains opportunity to grow units in Neulasta. With respect to both of those franchises, we think we have some price leverage, but it's important for us to be growing units as well."

I just think generally, if you look at pancreatic cancer treatment, if you look at prostate, if you look at some of the other therapies being used in those cancer settings, you'll see increased use of myelosuppressive agents and clinicians are treating their patients with per-cycle Neulasta to try to prevent fedro [ph] neutropenia.

I know that we speak to you today in an environment, a macro environment, of substantial uncertainty and the markets understandably reflect that uncertainty. However, when I focus on our business, I see progress on literally all fronts. We'll go over that progress today in each of our separate comments. But I want to reflect back on our last conversation, April 21, when we shared our business plan and our guidance through 2015. That was just a few months ago, but many things have happened since then. And I want to reiterate my conviction about that 2015 guidance and the various business elements that we outlined in building up our conviction around why we will deliver those numbers or better. 
We had some uncertainties that day that are not uncertainties any longer. We'll talk about that in depth today. I know that you are interested in, and I understand why, our ESA business particularly EPOGEN. We're prepared to discuss that in depth. And while there's still a few uncertainties in the EPOGEN business compared to what I was thinking and seeing on April 21, I feel much more clarity around how that business will move going forward. Bob will share that with you. 
I also want to point to the 8% product sales growth year-over-year, significant numbers and I'm proud of the effort behind that, and I'm optimistic about what it foretells for the future. We're also making the commentary, given these results, that we expect our guidance for 2011 to be at the top end of the range. So when I look at Amgen today, I feel great optimism and confidence about the future. And I want to thank all of the Amgen staff, I know many of whom are on this call, for their tremendous effort in delivering these great results this quarter and everything I know they'll do for patients and shareholders going forward.

So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, u",848,"Thanks, Kevin. So if we turn to Page 5 on the deck, that gives a summary of our financial performance for the quarter compared to the same period in 2010. 
Revenues overall were up 4%. But as Kevin mentioned, product sales grew at a much stronger rate, up 8%, driven by good performance across our portfolio, particularly from NEUPOGEN, Neulasta and Enbrel. Bob will talk more about this in a few minutes. 
Other revenues were down by $125 million due to certain milestone payments received in 2010 from GSK for Prolia approvals in Europe and from Takeda for the Vectibix approval in Japan. 
You'll see that operating expenses grew 15% or $329 million in, the quarter. This included $47 million for the new Healthcare Reform fee; $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes recorded in cost of sales, and for which we receive an offsetting foreign tax credit in our federal income taxes; and also $40 million increase in profit share payments to Pfizer as a result of higher Enbrel sales. Of the remaining increase of just under $200 million, $166 million, more than 80%, relates to the increase in research and development spending in the quarter.
So to comment on this, in setting our guidance for the year, we highlighted 2011 as an investment year for our research and development activities. This reflected the planned transition of several molecules from Phase II to Phase III and the resources needed to support our marketed products internationally. Consistent with this, close to 50% of the increase in the second quarter is driven by the costs associated with several new late-stage programs, particularly the Phase III trials for AMG 386, 479 and OncoVEX. The balance is driven by increased support for our marketed products, including Prolia and XGEVA and several of our established products in international markets. Discovery research in our early pipeline also drove a small increase. 
At our business review in April, as Kevin referenced, we provided guidance that we expect R&D in each of the next 5 years to fall in the range of 18% to 20% of product sales. For 2011, we expect to be within the high end of this range. And with this in mind, we'll continue to make choices about which program to take forward and to closely scrutinize the efficiency of the spend within each project. You may recall that in April, we highlighted several projects where decisions have been made to substantially reduce or terminate planned investments, as a result of reviewing the latest program milestones.
Moving to cost of sales. As I mentioned earlier, this includes $45 million for Puerto Rico excise taxes. If we exclude this charge, cost of sales would have been 13.5%, an improvement of 1.7% compared to 2010. This reflects much better utilization of our network, as a result of these restructuring actions that we've taken over the last 2 years. 
The tax rate in the quarter benefited from the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. And this is partially offset by the impact of the nondeductible Healthcare Reform fee. Net income therefore declined 3% in the quarter and EPS declined slightly year-on-year from $1.38 to $1.37. You may recall in setting our guidance for the year, our stated objective was to increase EPS before the impact of the Health Reform fee. Adjusting for the fee in the second quarter, EPS grew 3%.
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet on Page 6. Our cash balances grew by $4.7 billion compared to June 30, 2010. This is also an increase of $3.8 billion from March 31 of this year, driven by our bond issue of 3-point -- of $3 billion in June, free cash flows of $1.4 billion offset by share repurchases and the Bergamo acquisition. Our debt outstanding is now $14.2 billion, resulting in a net cash balance of $5 billion. The bond issue in the quarter was consistent with a capital plan that we presented in April, and we achieved coupons of 2.3%, 4.1% and 5.65% on the 5-, 10- and 31-year maturities respectively. 
During the quarter, total share repurchases amounted to $700 million at an average price of $56.87. We also announced today our first dividend for the quarter at $0.28 with a payment date of September 8 for all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18. And consistent with our guidance in April, we expect to return an average of 60% of net income each year to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. But the amount may be higher or lower in individual years.  
Finally, we're updating our guidance for the full year on Page 7 for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenues and adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of the current ranges of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion and $5 to $5.20 per share respectively. Guidance on the other metrics outlined on Page 7 remained the same.
Let me hand over to Bob to give more update on the product sales performance. Bob?"

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of Global Commercial performance for the second quarter. And as noted in our press release, our Global Product sales grew by 8% versus the second quarter of 2010, reflecting momentum in each of our product categories except ESAs. Excluding ESAs, revenues grew 18% during the quarter.
I'll review the business starting with Filgrastim. Our Filgrastim products grew 15% during the quarter. In the U.S., Filgrastim was up by 15% driven by Neulasta unit demand and to a lesser degree, price. Roughly 1/2 of the unit demand growth was from increased first-cycle penetration, particularly with newer, more myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. The remaining unit demand growth was driven by the timing of customer orders. 
Enbrel's 9% growth during the quarter was driven primarily by price and unit demand. Unit demand increases were driven largely by overall segment growth which was in the mid-teens on the year-over-year basis for both rheum and derm in 2011. Enbrel remains the market leader in both of these segments as of the end of second quarter. 
Now turning to EPOGEN. Although our EPOGEN sales declined by $114 million or 17% versus the same quarter last year, sales were actually up by $8 million or 1% versus the first quarter of 2011, an indication that our sales largely stabilized in the wake of bundling. We had previously stated that we expected a mid-teens percentage decline in dose for EPOGEN in 2011 due to bundling and that this impact would be concentrated in the first half of the year. The implementation of new protocols occurred a bit more rapidly than we expected but dose stabilized just about where we expected it would be. Now with the new label and the proposed QIP changes, we now expect year-over-year dose decline to be in the range of 20% to 25% and that, of course, will be partially offset by patient population growth and price increases. And I should stress that this range I've just given you assumes that QIP is finalized as proposed. 
Based on our experience with implementation of the bundled payment system, we think much of the impact will be realized in 2011, with some residual impact early in 2012. At that point, we believe practice changes will have been largely implemented by dialysis providers. 
Our expectations regarding the impact of label and reimbursement changes are largely informed by our extensive discussions with the nephrology community and our understanding of the relationship across dose, hemoglobin, the sub-10 population and the risk of transfusion. 
Through April, the mean hemoglobin level was about 11.2 grams per deciliter in the U.S., and about 12% of the patients had hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter. Now as the mean hemoglobin decreases for dialysis patients, the sub-10 population will inevitably increase. So if the mean hemoglobin level were to decrease, for example, to 10.5 grams per deciliter, then the sub-10 population would approximately triple, and we would expect to see considerably more transfusions as a result. The last time we saw hemoglobin levels below 10 was back in 1993, and we do not think physicians will accept the return to the treatment paradigm in place nearly 20 years ago. To put this in a global context, the mean hemoglobin in the U.K. was 11.3 grams per deciliter in the fourth quarter of last year and that's true across the big Western European markets outside of the U.K. as well. And in Canada, the mean hemoglobin was about 10.8 grams per deciliter earlier this year. So our expectation is that hemoglobin levels will decline from the current 11.2 but will remain above 10 grams per deciliter in the dialysis setting. During the 60-day comment period, we will be submitting our response to the proposed QIP, and we believe that the current sub-10 quality indicator should be maintained. We'll be monitoring developments on this front and, of course, we'll keep you updated as events play out. 
Turning now to Aranesp. Aranesp sales declined 3% during the second quarter, with sales down 10% in the U.S. Aranesp will also be impacted by the recent ESA label changes primarily related to CRI. However, as we discussed at our Business Review, pre-dialysis represented about $200 million of our U.S. sales in 2010. 
Shifting to Prolia now. In the U.S., Prolia grew 70% versus the first quarter of 2011. We're making steady progress on a number of fronts. Through the second quarter, over 70,000 patients have received Prolia in the U.S. As we discussed in our Business review, we planned to have part D coverage with affordable access, which means less than $100 per 6 months of treatment in place for 11 million lives by the end of the second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we secured access for more than 11 million lives by June 30. We expect catalysts in the second half for Prolia, including increased access through part D, returning patients in incremental patient awareness as a result of our print advertising. 
Now turning to XGEVA. XGEVA was up 74% versus the first quarter of 2011 and through the second quarter, more than 30,000 patients have been treated with XGEVA, representing rapid adoption of the product by oncologists and neurologists since our launch at the very end of last year. Importantly, we've seen solid share gains and overall segment growth. XGEVA ended the quarter with unit share of about 20%, and whereas we observed declines in the SRE segment prior to the launch of XGEVA, we are now experiencing mid single-digit growth. Clearly, XGEVA growth will rely on taking share from IV bisphosphonates. And as we discussed at our Business Review, XGEVA growth will also rely on increasing the length of treatment due to the improved renal tolerability and the ease of administration, as well as addressing the 200-plus thousand cancer patients with bone metastases who are not currently treated. The segment growth I cited gives us confidence that we're making progress on both fronts. 
I'd like to note that all of our products in the U.S. ended the quarter with wholesaler inventories in their normal ranges. 
And now let me turn to the International business. Second quarter was a record or us internationally. Sales grew in all countries except Spain. We maintained share against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia maintained double-digit growth rates, and we are pleased with the recent positive opinion from the CHMP for an expanded label for Vectibix.
Internationally, Prolia experienced steady growth. We've now launched in markets comprising 40% of the sales opportunity internationally. And over the balance of the year, we hope to launch in additional key markets, including Italy and Spain. We're also excited about the recent marketing authorization for XGEVA in Europe, which Roger will have more to say about in a moment. 
In summary, we're pleased with the solid growth of our core franchises, particularly Enbrel and Filgrastim, and the ongoing successful expansion of our international operations. Roger?"

The second quarter saw the approval of XGEVA in Canada and Europe, submission of our sBLA for bone metastasis prevention in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and continue progress in enrolling key clinical trials and advancing important research projects. 
Turning to Slide 11. As most of you know, we completed discussions with the FDA leading to modification of the U.S. Prescribing Information for erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. The label incorporates information from our TREAT study, which we've discussed previously, and focuses attention on the newly identified risk of ESA therapy while confirming the benefits that are well-known to physicians and to patients suffering from anemia resulting from renal disease. 
For Prolia, we had the opportunity earlier this week to see top-line data from our Phase III study, evaluating the ability of Denosumab administered at a dose of 60 milligrams once every 6 months to improve bone mineral density in men with low bone mass. The study met its primary and all secondary endpoints. An initial look at the safety database indicates that the findings are consistent with what we've seen in other populations. There were no new safety signals. We expect to submit the results of this study to regulatory agencies with the goal of expanding availability of the Prolia therapy to men, as well as women, with osteoporosis. 
As is mentioned earlier, we've received marketing authorization in Europe for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events in adults with bone metastasis from solid tumors. Also at the end of the second quarter, we submitted an sBLA to the FDA based on our favorable results from the 147 study, which were presented earlier this year. And these results demonstrated a reduced risk of bone metastases in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for these events. We expect to hear more from the FDA before the end of the third quarter regarding this review. 
Also, as Bob mentioned, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency has recommended that Vectibix be approved for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the first- and second-line setting. As we've previously noted, only patients whose tumors contain wild-type, that is unmutated KRAS genes, should receive Vectibix therapy. In the United States, we've just received Complete Response Letters related to the same indication. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies but requested an updated safety analysis and additional analysis of overall survival in the 181 and 203 studies using more mature data sets. Our combination diagnostic device for KRAS gene status, which we've developed in collaboration with Kyogen [ph], must also gain regulatory approval. 
As noted on the slide, we've recently changed the U.S. Prescribing Information for Nplate to make plain that treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia associated with the myelodysplastic syndrome is not indicated. You will recall that Nplate is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of low platelet counts in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP. The FDA has informed us that they intend to modify our Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to eliminate the restricted distribution component. In addition, to reduce the burden on health care practitioners, the Agency will no longer require that prescribers complete clinical assessment forms as part of the REMS. We're working closely with the Agency to ensure that patients and physicians remain well-informed about the appropriate use of Nplate.
Turning now to new programs and development. I'm pleased to report that the Phase III clinical study of OncoVEX GM-CSF for the treatment of stage 3, 4 malignant melanoma has completed enrollment. You will recall that this trial is being conducted under an FDA-agreed Special Protocol Assessment with the primary endpoint of durable clinical response. And separately, we have decided not to proceed with the OncoVEX GM-CSF Phase III program in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Recent studies have demonstrated that head and neck cancers associated with prior human papillomavirus infection behave very differently from tumors with other etiologies. These observations mandate that clinical trials ensure appropriate balance in the representation of subjects with prior papillomavirus infection. Since the changes in clinical trial design required are quite significant, we've elected to halt the current study and to initiate a redesign trial at a later time. Obviously, our approach to new indications for OncoVEX GM-CSF will take into account what we have learned through the conduct of our melanoma trial. 
Finally, those of you who followed our quarterly summaries will know that there is typically an underlying seasonality to our expense profile. Ordinarily, expenses increase later in the year. In 2011, however, we planned for early investments in key clinical trials. It is our intention to flatten the trajectory of R&D spending in Q3 and Q4 substantially. And as Jon noted, despite the increase in expenditures that we've seen in the first half of 2011, we expect R&D expense for the year as a whole to fall within our guidance of 20% of sales.

Certainly, we'll have a robust biosimilar environment in the United States, hard to predict exactly when, hard to predict how many.

Companies have to invest in clinical trials, they have to invest in manufacturing, they have to actually sell the product, they have to have regulatory capability, et cetera, et cetera. So this is a competitive environment. I expect that the players will be commercially rational and that our shareholders will demand that they earn a good return. And so I think it will be kind of like a normal business, if you will, where there are multiple competitors. We have experience in this. We will be smart, tenacious and I believe effective competitors in the United States just as we have been in Europe. I'd rather not try to speculate at this moment on exactly what the prices are.

But I respect that they're doing their best and in some cases, have had some success in reshaping their businesses. But I'd like to state that they're coming from a very, very different place than we. We have always been, and will remain, an absolute pure-play-focused human therapeutics company. In classical business sense, I understand your question. However, we have analyzed that question and I'd like to make a few points. First of all, despite the challenges this business has provide -- presented to us and shareholders over the last 5 years, it remains a very large contributor to revenues and importantly, income. Secondly, there are going to be, at least the United States, in the dialysis business, 300,000-plus patients who really, really need this medicine going forward and they're going to need it for as long as they're on dialysis. That is not going to change. And so it would be kind of the horse has already left the barn a little bit at this point to make that move. There are also issues around taxes, operating and other legal and operational issues. So we're not wedded to any given business. We are in business. We're in business to serve patients and shareholders. Our judgment is, right now, that we best serve patients and shareholders by managing this business well. But I want to assure shareholders that we are not wedded to any given business and we do evaluate properly with outside help our strategic alternatives. So it's not a crazy question, we have thought hard about it, but I think we can see what this business is going to look like. It's fully in our 2015 guidance. And actually compared to what I was thinking about April 21, strange as this may seem for you all to hear, I feel quite a bit comforted by where we are now and our visibility and certainty about the future. So good question, and we do look at that question."

Prolia, as I said in April and repeated today, we're pleased with the foundation that we've built. We're pleased with the momentum we have. We think there are catalysts for the second half, so we're expecting to see a continued acceleration from Prolia in the second half. And then, on your question about Enbrel and Neulasta. An, important question, again, were pleased Enbrel remains the market leader in both rheumatology and dermatology, but as your question reflects, there is competition. We now face 7 biologic competitors in the anti-TNF arena, and so the market is growing rapidly. We're growing with that market, and we're doing all we can to continue to see that patients that would benefit from the long safety and efficacy track record of Enbrel have access and opportunity to use the product. So we're encouraged by the trends we see, but we recognize there's a lot of competition for Enbrel. And on NEUPOGEN and Neulasta, again, worldwide, we're pleased with the volume growth that we saw, particularly for Neulasta. We recognize that there are newer myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens that are being used increasingly, and we're benefiting from per-cycle penetration of those newer regimens. And so as those continue to grow, as use of those regimens continues grow, I think there remains opportunity to grow units in Neulasta. With respect to both of those franchises, we think we have some price leverage, but it's important for us to be growing units as well."

I just think generally, if you look at pancreatic cancer treatment, if you look at prostate, if you look at some of the other therapies being used in those cancer settings, you'll see increased use of myelosuppressive agents and clinicians are treating their patients with first cycle Neulasta to try to prevent febrile neutropenia.

As you can see from our results, our business continues to perform well, with revenues and EPS both up 3%. Jon and Bob will review our financial and commercial performance in a moment, but I feel like we're well on track. 
We announced today that our board has authorized a $10 billion in share repurchases. The intent of this is to accelerate meaningfully our stock repurchase program and this reflects our confidence in our future outlook and long-term value, as well as the capital markets interest rate very favorable conditions. 
In the quarter, we also announced two important Executive personnel positions. I am delighted that Bob has been elected to our Board of Directors and we're also pleased that Tony Hooper has joined us from Bristol as Executive Vice President commercial reporting to Bob. Bob's experience and insight will ad real value to our board and Tony's many years of U.S. and international commercial experience will help drive our growth. 
We also announced an agreement in principle with the U.S. government to settle allegations relating to certain sales and marketing practices which have been the subject of previous disclosures. We recognized a $780 million reserve in anticipating a finalizing the settlement which should happen in the next three to four months. 
As we have approach the end of the year, I'm encouraged by the momentum and outlook for the business, leading us to raise our guidance and on revenues and earnings per share for 2011. 
Amgen is in a good place. We look forward to finishing a strong year and I want to thank all of Amgen's staff for their exceptional efforts this year on behalf of shareholders and patients. Jon, over to you?"

I'll start with a few comments in our performance in the quarter then address balance sheet issues and our updated guidance for the year. 
Overall, revenues grew 3% in the quarter, excluding ESAs, product sales grew 13%, reflecting strong growth across the portfolio, particularly on Europe franchises. Bob will comment more on our product sales in a few minutes. 
Operating expenses grew by 11% compared to the third quarter of 2010. More than half of the increase was driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax for which we benefit from an offsetting foreign tax credit further down. Foreign exchange movement in our international costs and the U.S. Health Care Reform fee. 
The balance of the increase in operating expenses which explains the research and development in SG&A. Research and development increased 11% year-on-year driven by our late stage clinical program costs. But quarter-on-quarter, R&D cost declined by $45 million. 
SG&A increases were driven by investments in the expansion of our international operations and in the launch of XGEVA. You'll see the top earnings per share an increase by 3% compared to 2010. There are two drivers of this increase in its operating income. The first is the tax rate of 10.9% which benefited from the foreign tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico foreign tax credit, the rate would have been 7.4%. And to a lesser degree, the lower rates in the quarter also benefited from the federal R&D credits which was not yet extended in the third quarter of 2010. 
The second factor impacting earnings per share is the average number of diluted shares which were 913 million for the quarter, 5% lower than the third quarter of 2010. I'll talk more about our share repurchase activity on the next page. 
To reiterate and as Kevin highlighted earlier, we've reached an agreement in principle to settle allegations related to certain sales and marketing practices that have been subject to previous disclosures. In connection with this agreement in principle, again as Kevin mentioned, we recognize the $718 million reserve which reduces our GAAP EPS for the quarter by $0.77. and we anticipate finalizing the settlement over the next 3 to 4 months. 
Turning to the next page, first of all, cash flow from operations you may have noticed that they were $300 million lower in the quarter compared to the same period last year. There are two reasons for this. The first was a full-year payment in the quarter of the U.S. Health Care Reform fee and the second was an advance payment of $145 million that we chose to make on future sense of our royalties in exchange for an attractive discount from the licensor. 
During the quarter, we also saw on the page that we repurchased 45 million shares at an average price of $53.30 per share. This broad the cost of our share repurchases in 2011 to $3.2 billion at an average price of $54.10. 
Looking forward, Amgen's Board of Directors again as Kevin mentioned earlier has authorized an increase for the company's stock repurchase program to a total amount of $10 billion. We intend to use this to accelerate our share repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the outlook and the long-term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment. 
The capital plan, we communicated in April left us with a significant and increasing net cash position. We now believe we can maintain the flexibility that we need to grow our business, consistent with the plans we outlined in April while also improving the returns to our shareholders by accelerating our stock repurchase plans. This means that we plan to return more than 60% of our net income to shareholders on average over the next few years. Within this, we maintain our plan to increase the dividend meaningfully over time and will also maintain a solid investment grade rating. 
Finally, turning to the next page, we've increased our guidance on revenues and adjusted EPS to $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion on revenues, and $25.15 to $5.30 a share on adjusted EPS. 
Related to this, we've also lowered our guidance on the full-year tax rate to 14% to 13% linked to the Puerto Rico tax credits. Let me turn it over to Bob to address the commercial side of the business."

On Slide 9, I'll walk you through the summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales grew 13% during the quarter, reflecting strength across the remainder of our portfolio and particularly in our newer franchises. 
I'll review the product starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Globally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 6% during the quarter. In the U.S. these products were up 8% fueled by both price and unit demand for Neulasta in particular. Unit demand continues to benefit from increased first cycle penetration. Internationally, we maintained record shares in this segment and reported a 3% increase in sales with the benefit of foreign exchange. 
Enbrel sales were up 1% versus the third quarter of last year. Rheumatology segment grew in the midteens and we maintained our leading share at a relatively stable 31%. The dermatology market grew 20% year-over-year. 
Although we lost six share points to competition on a year-over-year basis, Enbrel maintained the leading 40% share on dermatology as well. Year-to-date, Enbrel was up 6%. 
Our encores with Phil campaign featuring Phil Nicholson has received positive early feedback for building awareness of treatment options for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Turning to EPOGEN, EPOGEN sales declined by 27% versus the same quarter last year. The decline was driven primarily by the implementation of bundling and the product label changes in proposed CMS actions which was announced at the end of the second quarter. Just as we saw with bundling, we've seen a rapid implementation of protocol changes by dialysis providers in response to recent ESA label changes and proposed CMS actions. 
You may recall from our second quarter call that we expect that these changes to play out relatively quickly and result in a full-year dose decline in the range of 20% to 25%. That remains our view. We believe that the majority of the dose decline will play out this year, with only a minor residual impact through the first quarter of 2012. 
The ESA label changes also impacted Aranesp sales which declined 4% during the third quarter. Sensipar, Vectibix and on the other hand grew 19% versus the third quarter of 2010 contributing to the strength of our portfolio outside of the ESAs. 
Turning to our global launches for Denosumab. We are pleased with the momentum that we see for XGEVA. The product grew 40% versus the second quarter of 2011 and surpassed the $100 million in sales in just our third full quarter since launch. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. 
XGEVA ended the quarter with a unit share of approximately 23%, as we continue to take share from IV. The SRE segment grew 7% on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
In terms of use in urology clinics, there are now twice as many neurology practices using a bone-targeting agent now as compared to the period prior to the launch of XGEVA. 
On the international front, we launched XGEVA in Germany during the third quarter and the product is off to a strong start. 
Prolia grew 16% versus the second quarter, reflecting growth in our international markets. In the U.S., Prolia sales were soft in July and August, reflecting seasonal trends in the osteoporosis market overall and particularly for new patients starts. I would note we saw strong rebound in our sales, both the trends in September and so far through October. 
You may recall from our prior comments that we expect broad coverage under Part B. to serve as an important catalyst for Prolia. Let me give you an update on that front. 
Securing access was the first step in the process of advancing the Retail segment for the Prolia business, and we achieved that by the end of last quarter. As most primary care physicians prefer Part D, we are now focusing our efforts and enabling them to simply write a prescription for Prolia. As part of this, our representatives are working with providers to help navigate through the issues that come up under Part D such as the prior authorization process to ensure a successful payment claims. We're making progress here and have seen a significant increase in submitted retail claims in recent weeks. Internationally, Prolia grew 43% versus the second quarter of this year. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we have now launched in Italy and Spain, expanding our coverage to 75% of the EU sales opportunity for Prolia. 
For generally in our International business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 5% or again 12%, excluding ESAs. We continue to maintain shares against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and have maintained our price premium for both. 
Internationally, Vectibix, Nplate and grew by 20% in the aggregate. We are pleased with our continued progress in and emerging markets where we saw year-over-year sales growth of 43%. 
For the U.S. I'd note that at all of our products ended the quarter with wholesale inventories in their normal ranges, except for EPOGEN which was one day above our normal range. And some we're pleased with a broad strength of our business, particularly our newer products and we believe we are well-positioned for growth heading into 2012. Roger?"

This afternoon, I will review some of our clinical programs and I will speak briefly about the R&D restructuring that we announced last week. 
Turning to Slide 11 in the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress in advancing our late stage programs. Early in the quarter, the European commission granted a marketing authorization for XGEVA as a means of preventing bone complications in patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to the skeleton. As Bob indicated, the launch of XGEVA in Europe is just beginning, but is proceeding well. 
I should note that we are working closely with the FDA on the review of XGEVA and the setting of castrate-resistant prostate cancer as a mean of delaying bone metastases. The PDUFA date for this review is April 26, 2012. 
Also with regard to Denosumab during the third quarter, the FDA expanded the indication for Prolia to include treatment of patients that are high risk for fracture who are receiving Anderson the perturbation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer for adjuvant Roy dividend therapy for breast cancer. 
We continue to make great strides in enrolling our key Phase III programs. The first with respect to talimogene laherparepvec, are virus therapy. We have completed enrollment of our Phase III study in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. The therapy previously referred to as callbacks will henceforth for obvious reasons we denoted as David. As you will recall, P. that is administered by injection of visible to more masses and that's exposed to direct licensing the two marks as well as simulating a systemic immune response to malignant cells. The primary end point for this study remains the durable complete response, the enrollment was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal. We've also made extremely good progress in enrolling Phase  III studies for AMG 4790 in pancreatic cancer and AMG 386 in ovarian cancer. Regarding the latter, some of you will be aware that shortages in the chemotherapy agent doxyl from Johnson & Johnson may delay enrollment in our turnover 2 Phase III study exploring the usage of AMG 386 a second line therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Such a delay should occur will not have any effect in our ability to gain registration for AMG 386 using our larger one Phase III study which employs AMG 386 in combination with a different chemotherapeutic regimen. 
We've had detailed discussions of regulatory agents in our Phase III study designs for AMG 785, our antagonist for patients with low bone mass at high risk for fracture and for AMG 827, our I U. I L. 17 receptor antagonist for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. We expect both of these programs to begin enrolling patients in the near future. 
With respect to AMG 8287, I should note that following the review of interim data, we elected to discontinue our Phase II study of causes since we believe it's unlikely that this treatment will benefit such patients. Others have reported the IL-17 antagonisms associated with worse outcomes in the chronic disease population. 
Finally, we continue to make adjustments to our portfolio. As previously announced, we have discontinued development of conatumomab, MG6 55 for the treatment of malignant disease. However, new Phase II data for ready to move out, AMG 102, our antibody directed against you growth factor which we presented at the Ecko Estel meeting in September suggest that this molecule may have activity in gastric cancer. In particular, we found that rather administered 173 weeks in combination with traditional chemotherapy appeared to improve response rates, progression-free survival and the overall survival in the first time treatment of patients with gastric cancer. Additional studies indicate that panitumumab would be especially effective in patients who's tumors express high levels of C. Matt the receptor for the growth factor we are reviewing these findings very carefully. 
We continued progression of our late stage pipeline in oncology inflammation and in metabolic disease has catalyzed a review of our entire R&D spending profile. While we are encouraged by the success of so many programs, the Phase III cost for the company these programs are quite substantial. 
I have previously discussed with you our commitment to ensure that we continue to live within our means. With this in mind, last week, we announced a reduction in R&D headcount. This was necessary to refocus our R&D programs on those efforts likely to have a near-term clinical impact. The burden of restructuring fell most heavily on scientists in early discovery, but was designed to increase the efficiency of our key therapeutic areas. The effects of this sharpening of focus will be evident during 2012 when we also expect to see data from our Phase III cardiovascular outcomes study of Sensipar in dialysis patients for secondary hyperthyroidism and of our Phase III study of in patients in advanced malignant melanoma.

This is a very different kind of a clinical program from what one sees in anti-resorptive agents. So you're not going to want to give AMG 785 for a very, very protracted period and hence the end points of the study will have to be looked at somewhat earlier because you don't want to confuse the anabolic effect with anti-resorptive effects that might result from the use of traditional agents which would inevitably have to be used thereafter. You can't leave patients with osteoporosis untreated in this setting.

As you can see from our results, our business continues to perform well with revenues and EPS both up 3%. Jon and Bob will review our financial and commercial performance in a moment, but I feel like we're well on track. 
We announced today that our Board has authorized a $10 billion in share repurchases. The intent of this is to accelerate meaningfully our stock repurchase program, and this reflects our confidence in our future outlook and long-term value, as well as the capital markets' interest rate very favorable conditions. 
In the quarter, we also announced 2 important executive personnel positions. I'm delighted that Bob has been elected to our Board of Directors, and we're also pleased that Tony Hooper has joined us from Bristol as Executive Vice President Commercial reporting to Bob. Bob's experience and insights will add real value to our Board, and Tony's many years of U.S. and international commercial experience will help drive our growth. 
We also announced an agreement in principle with the U.S. government to settle allegations relating to certain sales and marketing practices, which have been the subject of previous disclosures. We recognized a $780 million reserve in anticipating and finalizing the settlement, which should happen in the next 3 to 4 months. 
As we have approach the end of the year, I'm encouraged by the momentum and outlook for the business, leading us to raise our guidance and -- on revenues and earnings per share for 2011. 
Amgen is in a good place. We look forward to finishing a strong year, and I want to thank all of Amgen's staff for their exceptional efforts this year on behalf of shareholders and patients.

I'll start with a few comments in our performance in the quarter, then address balance sheet issues and our updated guidance for the year. 
Overall, revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Excluding ESAs, product sales grew 13%, reflecting strong growth across the portfolio, particularly on Europe franchises. Bob will comment more on our product sales in a few minutes. 
Operating expenses grew by 11% compared to the third quarter of 2010. More than half of the increase was driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax for which we benefit from an offsetting foreign tax credit further down. Foreign exchange movements on our international costs and the U.S. health care reform fee. 
The balance of the increase in operating expenses, which was explained by research and developments in SG&A, research and development increased 11% year-on-year driven by our late-stage clinical program costs. But quarter-on-quarter, R&D costs declined by $45 million. SG&A increases were driven by investments in the expansion of our international operations and in the launch of XGEVA. 
You'll see adjusted earnings per share have increased by 3% compared to 2010. There are 2 drivers of this increase relative to operating income. First is the tax rate of 10.9%,  which benefited from the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico foreign tax credit, the rate would have been 17.4%. And to a lesser degree, the lower rates in the quarter also benefited from the federal R&D credits, which was not yet extended in the third quarter of 2010. 
The second factor impacting earnings per share is the average number of diluted shares, which were 913 million for the quarter, 5% lower than the third quarter of 2010. I'll talk more about our share repurchase activity on the next page. 
Now to reiterate, and as Kevin highlighted earlier, we've reached an agreement in principle to settle allegations related to certain sales and marketing practices that have been a subject to previous disclosures. In connection with this agreement in principle, again, as Kevin mentioned, we've recognized the $780 million reserve, which reduces our GAAP EPS in the quarter by $0.77. And we anticipate finalizing the settlement over the next 3 to 4 months. 
Turning to the next page, first of all, cash flow from operations, you may have noticed that there's $300 million lower in the quarter compared to the same period last year. There are 2 reasons for this. The first was a full year payment in the quarter of the U.S. health care reform fee, and the second was an advance payment of $145 million that we chose to make on future sense of our royalties in exchange for an attractive discount from the licensor. 
During the quarter, you'll also see on the page that we repurchased 45 million shares at an average price of $53.30 per share. This brought the cost of our total share repurchases in 2011 to $3.2 billion at an average price of $54.10. 
Looking forward, Amgen's Board of Directors, again as Kevin mentioned earlier, has authorized an increase for the company's stock repurchase program to a total amount of $10 billion. We intend to use this to accelerate our share repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the outlook and the long-term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment. 
The capital plan we communicated in April left us with a significant and increasing net cash position. We now believe we can maintain the flexibility that we need to grow our business, consistent with the plans we outlined in April, while also improving the returns to our shareholders by accelerating our stock repurchase plans. This means that we plan to return more than 60% of our net income to shareholders, on average, over the next few years. Within this, we maintain our plan to increase the dividend meaningfully over time, and we'll also maintain a solid investment grade rating. 
Finally, turning to the next page, we've increased our guidance on revenues and adjusted EPS to $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion on revenues, and to fill our $5.15 to $5.30 a share on adjusted EPS. 
Related to this, we've also lowered our guidance on the full year tax rate to 14% from 15% linked to the Puerto Rico tax credits. 
Let me turn over to Bob to address the commercial side of the business."
24816,140764891,176797,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through a summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales g",895,"All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through a summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales grew 13% during the quarter, reflecting strength across the remainder of our portfolio and particularly, in our newer franchises. 
I'll review the product starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Globally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 6% during the quarter. In the U.S., these products were up 8%,  fueled by both price and unit demand for Neulasta in particular. Unit demand continues to benefit from increased first cycle penetration. Internationally, we maintained record shares in this segment and reported a 3% increase in sales with the benefit of foreign exchange. 
Enbrel sales were up 1% versus the third quarter of last year. Rheumatology segment grew in the mid-teens, and we maintained our leading share at a relatively stable 31%. The dermatology market grew 20% year-over-year. 
Although we lost 6 share points to competition on a year-over-year basis, Enbrel maintained the leading 40% share on dermatology as well. Year-to-date, Enbrel is up 6%. 
Our ""On Course with Phil"" campaign featuring Phil Mickelson has received positive early feedback for building awareness of treatment options for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Turning to EPOGEN, EPOGEN sales declined by 27% versus the same quarter last year. The decline was driven primarily by the implementation of bundling and the product label changes and proposed CMS actions, which were announced at the end of the second quarter. Just as we saw with bundling, we've seen a rapid implementation of protocol changes by dialysis providers in response to recent ESA label changes and proposed CMS actions. 
You may recall from our second quarter call that we expect that these changes to play out relatively quickly, and result in a full year dose decline in the range of 20% to 25%. That remains our view. We believe that the majority of the dose decline will play out this year, with only a minor residual impact through the first quarter of 2012. 
The ESA label changes also impacted Aranesp sales, which declined 4% during the third quarter. Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate on the other hand, grew 19% versus the third quarter of 2010, contributing to the strength of our portfolio outside of the ESAs. 
Turning to our global launches for denosumab, we're pleased with the momentum that we see for XGEVA. The product grew 40% versus the second quarter of 2011, and surpassed the $100 million in sales in just our third full quarter since launch. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. 
XGEVA ended the quarter with a unit share of approximately 23%, as we continue to take share from IV bisphosphonates. The SRE segment grew 7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
In terms of use in neurology, there are now twice as many neurology practices using a bone-targeting agent now as compared to the period prior to the launch of XGEVA. 
On the international front, we launched XGEVA in Germany during the third quarter and the product is off to a strong start. 
Prolia grew 16% versus the second quarter, reflecting growth in our international markets. In the U.S., Prolia sales were soft in July and August, reflecting seasonal trends in the osteoporosis market overall, and particularly for new patients starts. I would note we saw a strong rebound in our sales growth trends in September, and so far, through October. 
You may recall from our prior comments that we expect broad coverage under Part D to serve as an important catalyst for Prolia. Let me give you an update on that front. 
Securing access was the first step in the process of advancing the retail segment for the Prolia business, and we achieved that by the end of the last quarter. As most primary care physicians prefer Part D, we are now focusing our efforts on enabling them to simply write a prescription for Prolia. As part of this, our representatives are working with providers to help navigate through the issues that come up under Part D, such as the prior authorization process to ensure a successful payment claims. We're making progress here and have seen a significant increase in submitted retail claims in recent weeks. 
Internationally, Prolia grew 43% versus the second quarter of this year. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we have now launched in Italy and Spain, expanding our coverage to 75% of the EU sales opportunity for Prolia. 
For generally in our International business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 5%,  or again 12%, excluding ESAs. We continue to maintain shares against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim and have maintained our price premium for both. 
Internationally, Vectibix, Nplate and Mimpara grew by 23% in the aggregate. We're pleased with our continued progress in new and emerging markets where we saw year-over-year sales growth of 43%. 
For the U.S., I'd note that at all of our products ended the quarter with wholesale inventories in their normal ranges, except for EPOGEN, which was one day above our normal range. And some we're pleased with a broad strength of our business, particularly our newer products. And we believe we're well-positioned for growth heading into 2012.

This afternoon, I will review some of our clinical programs, and I will speak briefly about the R&D restructuring that we announced last week. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress in advancing our late-stage programs. Early in the quarter, the European Commission granted their marketing authorization for XGEVA as a means of preventing bone complications in patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to the skeleton. As Bob indicated, the launch of XGEVA in Europe is just beginning, but is proceeding well. 
I should note that we are working closely with the FDA on the review of XGEVA and the setting of castrate-resistant prostate cancer as a means of delaying bone metastases. The PDUFA date for this review is April 26, 2012. 
Also with regard to denosumab, during the third quarter, the FDA expanded the indication for Prolia to include treatment of patients that are high risk for fracture who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer or adjuvant aromatase-inhibited therapy for breast cancer. 
We continue to make great strides in enrolling our key Phase III programs. The first with respect to talimogene laherparepvec, our oncolytic virus therapy. We have completed enrollment of our Phase III study in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. The therapy previously referred to as OncoVEXGM-CSF, will henceforth, for obvious reasons, be denoted as TVEC [ph]. As you will recall, TVEC [ph] is administered by injection into visible tumor masses, and acts both by directly lysing the tumor, as well as simulating a systemic immune response to malignant cells. The primary end point for this study remains the durable complete response, though enrollment was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal. 
We've also made extremely good progress in enrolling Phase III studies for AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer and AMG 386 in ovarian cancer. Regarding the latter, some of you will be aware that shortages in the chemotherapy agent DOXIL from Johnson & Johnson may delay enrollment in our, TRINOVA-2 Phase III study, exploring the use of AMG 386 a second line therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Such a delay should occur will not have any effect on our ability to gain registration for AMG 386 using our larger TRINOVA-1 Phase III study, which employs AMG 386 in combination with a different chemotherapeutic regimen. 
We've had detailed discussions of regulatory agents on our Phase III study designs for AMG 785, our sclerostin antagonist for patients with low bone mass at high risk for fracture, and for AMG 827, our IL-17 receptor antagonist for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. We expect both of these programs to begin enrolling patients in the near future. 
With respect to AMG 827, I should note that following a review of interim data, we elected to discontinue our Phase II study in Crohn's disease since we believe it's unlikely that this treatment would benefit such patients. Others have reported the IL-17 antagonism is associated with worse outcomes in the Crohn's disease population. 
Finally, we continue to make adjustments to our portfolio. As previously announced, we have discontinued development of conatumomab, AMG 655, for the treatment of malignant disease. However, new Phase II data for rilotumumab, AMG 102, our antibody directed against hepatocyte growth factor, which we presented at the ECCO and ESMO meeting in September, suggest that this molecule may have activity in gastric cancer. In particular, we found that rilotumumab administered 173 weeks, in combination with traditional chemotherapy, appeared to improve response rates, progression-free survival and the overall survival in the first time treatment of patients with gastric cancer. Additional studies indicate that rilotumumab would be especially effective in patients who's tumors express high levels of c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. We are reviewing these findings very carefully. 
The continued progression of our late-stage pipeline in oncology, inflammation and in metabolic disease has catalyzed the review of our entire R&D spending profile. While we are encouraged by the success of so many programs, the Phase III cost for the company of these programs are quite substantial. 
I have previously discussed with you our commitment to ensure that we continue to live within our means. With this in mind, last week, we announced a reduction in R&D headcount. This was necessary to refocus our R&D programs on those efforts likely to have a near-term clinical impact. The burden of restructuring fell most heavily on scientists in early discovery, but was designed to increase the efficiency of our key therapeutic areas. The effects of this sharpening of focus will be evident during 2012 when we also expect to see data from our Phase III cardiovascular outcomes study of Sensipar in dialysis patients for secondary hyperparathyroidism and of our Phase III study of TVEC [ph] in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.

So you're not going to want to give AMG 785 for a very, very protracted period and hence the end points of the study will have to be looked at somewhat earlier because you don't want to confuse the anabolic effect with anti-resorptive effects that might result from the use of traditional agents which would inevitably have to be used thereafter. You can't leave patients with osteoporosis untreated in this setting. So the studies will have a quite different design in that sense from the usual kind of the anti-resorptive design.

As you can see from our results, our business continues to perform well with revenues and EPS both up 3%. Jon and Bob will review our financial and commercial performance in a moment, but I feel like we're well on track. 
We announced today that our Board has authorized a $10 billion in share repurchases. The intent of this is to accelerate meaningfully our stock repurchase program, and this reflects our confidence in our future outlook and long-term value, as well as the capital markets' interest rate very favorable conditions. 
In the quarter, we also announced 2 important executive personnel positions. I'm delighted that Bob has been elected to our Board of Directors, and we're also pleased that Tony Hooper has joined us from Bristol as Executive Vice President Commercial reporting to Bob. Bob's experience and insights will add real value to our Board, and Tony's many years of U.S. and international commercial experience will help drive our growth. 
We also announced an agreement in principle with the U.S. government to settle allegations relating to certain sales and marketing practices, which have been the subject of previous disclosures. We recognized a $780 million reserve in anticipating and finalizing this settlement, which should happen in the next 3 to 4 months. 
As we have approach the end of the year, I'm encouraged by the momentum and outlook for the business, leading us to raise our guidance and -- on revenues and earnings per share for 2011. 
Amgen is in a good place. We look forward to finishing a strong year, and I want to thank all of Amgen's staff for their exceptional efforts this year on behalf of shareholders and patients.

I'll start with a few comments in our performance in the quarter, then address balance sheet issues and our updated guidance for the year. 
Overall, revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Excluding ESAs, product sales grew 13%, reflecting strong growth across the portfolio, particularly on Europe franchises. Bob will comment more on our product sales in a few minutes. 
Operating expenses grew by 11% compared to the third quarter of 2010. More than half of the increase was driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax for which we benefit from an offsetting foreign tax credit further down. Foreign exchange movements on our international costs and the U.S. health care reform fee. 
The balance of the increase in operating expenses, which was explained by research and developments in SG&A, research and development increased 11% year-on-year driven by our late-stage clinical program costs. But quarter-on-quarter, R&D costs declined by $45 million. SG&A increases were driven by investments in the expansion of our international operations and in the launch of XGEVA. 
You'll see adjusted earnings per share have increased by 3% compared to 2010. There are 2 drivers of this increase relative to operating income. First is the tax rate of 10.9%,  which benefited from the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico foreign tax credit, the rate would have been 17.4%. And to a lesser degree, the lower rates in the quarter also benefited from the federal R&D credits, which was not yet extended in the third quarter of 2010. 
The second factor impacting earnings per share is the average number of diluted shares, which were 913 million for the quarter, 5% lower than the third quarter of 2010. I'll talk more about our share repurchase activity on the next page. 
Now to reiterate, and as Kevin highlighted earlier, we've reached an agreement in principle to settle allegations related to certain sales and marketing practices that have been a subject of previous disclosures. In connection with this agreement in principle, again, as Kevin mentioned, we've recognized the $780 million reserve, which reduces our GAAP EPS in the quarter by $0.77. And we anticipate finalizing the settlement over the next 3 to 4 months. 
Turning to the next page, first of all, cash flow from operations, you may have noticed that there's a $300 million lower in the quarter compared to the same period last year. There are 2 reasons for this. The first was a full year payment in the quarter of the U.S. health care reform fee, and the second was an advance payment of $145 million that we chose to make on future sense of our royalties in exchange for an attractive discount from the licensor. 
During the quarter, you'll also see on the page that we repurchased 45 million shares at an average price of $53.30 per share. This brought the cost of our total share repurchases in 2011 to $3.2 billion at an average price of $54.10. 
Looking forward, Amgen's Board of Directors, again as Kevin mentioned earlier, has authorized an increase for the company's stock repurchase program to a total amount of $10 billion. We intend to use this to accelerate our share repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the outlook and the long-term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment. 
The capital plan we communicated in April left us with a significant and increasing net cash position. We now believe we can maintain the flexibility that we need to grow our business, consistent with the plans we outlined in April, while also improving the returns to our shareholders by accelerating our stock repurchase plans. This means that we plan to return more than 60% of our net income to shareholders, on average, over the next few years. Within this, we maintain our plan to increase the dividend meaningfully over time, and we'll also maintain a solid investment grade rating. 
Finally, turning to the next page, we've increased our guidance on revenues and adjusted EPS to $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion on revenues, and to fill our $5.15 to $5.30 a share on adjusted EPS. 
Related to this, we've also lowered our guidance on the full year tax rate to 14% to 15% linked to the Puerto Rico tax credits. 
Let me turn over to Bob to address the commercial side of the business."
24816,140764891,176840,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through a summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales g",895,"All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through a summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter. As noted in our press release, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding ESAs, sales grew 13% during the quarter, reflecting strength across the remainder of our portfolio and particularly, in our newer franchises. 
I'll review the product starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Globally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 6% during the quarter. In the U.S., these products were up 8%,  fueled by both price and unit demand for Neulasta in particular. Unit demand continues to benefit from increased first cycle penetration. Internationally, we maintained record shares in this segment and reported a 3% increase in sales with the benefit of foreign exchange. 
Enbrel sales were up 1% versus the third quarter of last year. Rheumatology segment grew in the mid-teens, and we maintained our leading share at a relatively stable 31%. The dermatology market grew 20% year-over-year. 
Although we lost 6 share points to competition on a year-over-year basis, Enbrel maintained a leading 40% share on dermatology as well. Year-to-date, Enbrel is up 6%. 
Our ""On Course with Phil"" campaign featuring Phil Mickelson has received positive early feedback for building awareness of treatment options for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Turning to EPOGEN, EPOGEN sales declined by 27% versus the same quarter last year. The decline was driven primarily by the implementation of bundling and the product label changes and proposed CMS actions, which were announced at the end of the second quarter. Just as we saw with bundling, we've seen a rapid implementation of protocol changes by dialysis providers in response to recent ESA label changes and proposed CMS actions. 
You may recall from our second quarter call that we expect that these changes to play out relatively quickly, and result in a full year dose decline in the range of 20% to 25%. That remains our view. We believe that the majority of the dose decline will play out this year, with only a minor residual impact through the first quarter of 2012. 
The ESA label changes also impacted Aranesp sales, which declined 4% during the third quarter. Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate on the other hand, grew 19% versus the third quarter of 2010, contributing to the strength of our portfolio outside of the ESAs. 
Turning to our global launches for denosumab, we're pleased with the momentum that we see for XGEVA. The product grew 40% versus the second quarter of 2011, and surpassed the $100 million in sales in just our third full quarter since launch. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. 
XGEVA ended the quarter with a unit share of approximately 23%, as we continue to take share from IV bisphosphonates. The SRE segment grew 7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
In terms of use in neurology clinics, there are now twice as many neurology practices using a bone-targeting agent now as compared to the period prior to the launch of XGEVA. 
On the international front, we launched XGEVA in Germany during the third quarter, and the product is off to a strong start. 
Prolia grew 16% versus the second quarter, reflecting growth in our international markets. In the U.S., Prolia sales were soft in July and August, reflecting seasonal trends in the osteoporosis market overall, and particularly for new patients starts. I would note we saw a strong rebound in our sales growth trends in September, and so far, through October. 
You may recall from our prior comments that we expect broad coverage under Part D to serve as an important catalyst for Prolia. Let me give you an update on that front. 
Securing access was the first step in the process of advancing the retail segment of the Prolia business, and we achieved that by the end of the last quarter. As most primary care physicians prefer Part D, we are now focusing our efforts on enabling them to simply write a prescription for Prolia. As part of this, our representatives are working with providers to help navigate through the issues that come up under Part D, such as the prior authorization process to ensure successful payment claims. We're making progress here and have seen a significant increase in submitted retail claims in recent weeks. 
Internationally, Prolia grew 43% versus the second quarter of this year. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we have now launched in Italy and Spain, expanding our coverage to 75% of the EU sales opportunity for Prolia. 
More generally in our International business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 5%,  or again 12%, excluding ESAs. We continue to maintain shares against biosimilar competition for Aranesp and Filgrastim and have maintained our price premium for both. 
Internationally, Vectibix, Nplate and Mimpara grew by 23% in the aggregate. We're pleased with our continued progress in new and emerging markets where we saw year-over-year sales growth of 43%. 
For the U.S., I'd note that at all of our products ended the quarter with wholesale inventories in their normal ranges, except for EPOGEN, which was one day above our normal range. And some we're pleased with a broad strength of our business, particularly our newer products. And we believe we're well-positioned for growth heading into 2012.

This afternoon, I will review some of our clinical programs, and I will speak briefly about the R&D restructuring that we announced last week. Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress in advancing",811,"Thanks, Bob. This afternoon, I will review some of our clinical programs, and I will speak briefly about the R&D restructuring that we announced last week. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress in advancing our late-stage programs. Early in the quarter, the European Commission granted their marketing authorization for XGEVA as a means of preventing bone complications in patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to the skeleton. As Bob indicated, the launch of XGEVA in Europe is just beginning, but is proceeding well. 
I should note that we are working closely with the FDA on the review of XGEVA and the setting of castrate-resistant prostate cancer as a means of delaying bone metastases. The PDUFA date for this review is April 26, 2012. 
Also with regard to denosumab, during the third quarter, the FDA expanded the indication for Prolia to include treatment of patients at high risk for fracture who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer or adjuvant aromatase-inhibited therapy for breast cancer. 
We continue to make great strides in enrolling our key Phase III programs. The first with respect to talimogene laherparepvec, our oncolytic virus therapy. We have completed enrollment of our Phase III study in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. The therapy previously referred to as OncoVEX GM-CSF, will henceforth, for obvious reasons, be denoted as TVEC [ph]. As you will recall, TVEC [ph] is administered by injection into visible tumor masses, and acts both by directly lysing the tumor, as well as simulating a systemic immune response to malignant cells. The primary end point for this study remains the durable complete response, though enrollment was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal. 
We've also made extremely good progress in enrolling Phase III studies for AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer and AMG 386 in ovarian cancer. Regarding the latter, some of you will be aware that shortages in the chemotherapy agent DOXIL from Johnson & Johnson may delay enrollment in our TRINOVA-2 Phase III study, exploring the use of AMG 386 as second line therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Such a delay, should occur, will not have any effect on our ability to gain registration for AMG 386 using our larger TRINOVA-1 Phase III study, which employs AMG 386 in combination with a different chemotherapeutic regimen. 
We've had detailed discussions of regulatory agents on our Phase III study designs for AMG 785, our sclerostin antagonist for patients with low bone mass at high risk for fracture, and for AMG 827, our IL-17 receptor antagonist for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. We expect both of these programs to begin enrolling patients in the near future. 
With respect to AMG 827, I should note that following a review of interim data, we elected to discontinue our Phase II study in Crohn's disease since we believe it's unlikely that this treatment would benefit such patients. Others have reported the IL-17 antagonism is associated with worse outcomes in the Crohn's disease population. 
Finally, we continue to make adjustments to our portfolio. As previously announced, we have discontinued development of conatumomab, AMG 655, for the treatment of malignant disease. However, new Phase II data for rilotumumab, AMG 102, our antibody directed against hepatocyte growth factor, which we presented at the ECCO and ESMO meeting in September, suggest that this molecule may have activity in gastric cancer. In particular, we found that rilotumumab administered once every 3 weeks, in combination with traditional chemotherapy, appeared to improve response rates, progression-free survival and the overall survival in the first time treatment of patients with gastric cancer. Additional studies indicate that rilotumumab may be especially effective in patients whose tumors express high levels of c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. We are reviewing these findings very carefully. 
The continued progression of our late-stage pipeline in oncology, inflammation and in metabolic disease has catalyzed the review of our entire R&D spending profile. While we are encouraged by the success of so many programs, the Phase III cost for the company of these programs are quite substantial. 
I have previously discussed with you our commitment to ensure that we continue to live within our means. With this in mind, last week, we announced a reduction in R&D headcount. This was necessary to refocus our R&D programs on those efforts likely to have a near-term clinical impact. The burden of restructuring fell most heavily on scientists in early discovery, but was designed to increase the efficiency of our key therapeutic areas. The effects of this sharpening of focus will be evident during 2012 when we also expect to see data from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of Sensipar in dialysis patients for secondary hyperparathyroidism and of our Phase III study of TVEC [ph] in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.

Clearly, as an anabolic agent, this is a very different kind of a clinical program from what one sees in anti-resorptive agents. So you're not going to want to give AMG 785 for a very, very protracted period and hence the end points of the study will have to be looked at somewhat earlier because you don't want to confuse the anabolic effect with anti-resorptive effects that might result from the use of traditional agents which would inevitably have to be used thereafter. You can't leave patients with osteoporosis untreated in this setting. So the studies will have a quite different design in that sense from the usual kind of anti-resorptive design. And we'll be prepared to share the study design with you in the very near future because as I say, we'll be beginning those studies very, very soon we expect.

We have Phase II data from a single-arm study that, as you know, that provided very impressive complete response rates. The Phase III study is like the Phase II study in terms of its overall design. It paralleled essentially completely with the difference being, of course, the size of the study, and as well as the GM-CSF subcutaneous arm, in order to exclude the possibility that expression of GM-CSF is having that beneficial effect. I think it's understandable in that context why the agency would feel extremely comfortable with that kind of study. And again, when launching the Phase III study to try and duplicate the kinds of things that one saw in the Phase II, which were so promising, I think that with respect to the entry criteria, that's what makes the most sense."

It was kind of a different question that was being addressed by the ODAC panel. And a much more general question that the agency had about how to look at therapies for patients with so-called castrate-resistant prostate cancer, who had not yet sustained metastases. The benefit of providing XGEVA to such patients based on the 147 study, we believe is quite clear. You've had a chance to see those data, and we will have the opportunity, of course, to discuss those data further with the FDA. They're in the midst of their review process. But we think that the benefits are significant with respect to delaying metastases. And we believe the agency will view it that way as well. The survival we show I think is a separate one, and it will be addressed separately. We were not -- we did not design the study to look at survival and the patients who sustained metastases were immediately put on alternative therapies for skeletal-related events. And so there was no way, really, to assess survival. And the agency understood that in terms of the study design."

We recognized other significant macroeconomic pressure, and some of that pressure may be reflected in price changes, and we're continuing to watch that pretty carefully. I would observe that, thus far, through the first 9 months of the year, price impact has played out pretty much as we expected it would in Europe, so less than a handful of percentage points for us across the whole of our portfolio.

There was some catch up in the estimate on the foreign tax credit that were applicable to the Puerto Rico taxes this quarter.

And I think we gave you guidance for the full year of 14% to 15%. So that's what you should look at for the year ahead. The reason it so low this quarter was that we were able to refine our estimates on the foreign tax credit that we could use against the Puerto Rico taxes. So hopefully that answers your question.
