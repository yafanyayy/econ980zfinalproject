We had a very strong third quarter with $1.1 billion of net income, which is close to a record for our company.

We had a very strong third quarter with $1.1 billion of net income, which is close to a record for our company. We executed on our ability to capture several of the key market drivers in our business, including the crack spreads in our geographic markets, the differential between our sweet and sour crude basket and the spread between West Texas Intermediate price crudes and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet.
I'm going to ask Mike Palmer, our Senior VP of Supply, Distribution and Planning to go into a little more detail about the crudes we process and how we are positioned to optimize the crude slate across our refineries to produce the highest value of finished product yields. But first, I want to explain our balanced approach to business.
Clearly, the WTI LLS spread is attractive today, and our earnings benefited from this market condition. We've been successful in this business a long time and we have structured our logistical and refining assets so that our future earnings and cash flow are not writing just on the wide WTI LLS spread. Market conditions are always changing, and the current price differential between WTI and LLS won't be an exception. But having said that, we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growth of crude production, and we are investing in our logistics system to ensure we have access to the growing sources of crudes that are priced off of WTI as well as Canadian crudes.
Now I would like to elaborate on what I mean by a balanced approach to our business. First, we have a balanced crude slate, refining nearly 50% sour and 50% sweet crude. We have the flexibility to alter our sweet and sour crude slate in every given quarter or in response to market conditions. Second, we are balancing our geographic markets with a little over 50% of our refining capacity in PADD II. This PADD II capacity is well positioned to refine increased Canadian crude production as well as a prospective crude production. We also have the advantage of being able to move WTI feedstocks to our logistics system to our PADD II refineries. 
Further strengthening our PADD II position, upgrades to our Detroit refinery were approximately 73% complete as of September 30, 2011. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. And when completed, these upgrades should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, reducing our feedstock cost and increasing Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
It is also important to note that PADD II is a net short of refined products. So we tend to run our plants at relatively higher utilization rates and better crack spreads than PADD III refineries. The other half of our crude report refining capacities in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which gives us access to favorable export markets. Our Garyville refinery is the newest and we believe one of the most efficient refineries in the country. And when we planned the expansion of Garyville, which we completed in 2009, we expected distillate demand to grow faster than gasoline demand, and that certainly has been the case. Global demand for distillate continues to increase providing the opportunity to increase distillate exports to higher valuable global markets. 
During the third quarter, we continued the optimization of Garyville, which is running significantly above its nameplate capacity. We also increased the amount of distillate for export from Garyville to approximately 73,000 barrels per day last quarter. With modest additional investment, we believe we can increase our distillate for sales exports even more, providing us with additional options to place more of our refinery production in higher value markets.
Another point of balance in our business is our integrated approach in using our significant logistics operations to connect our refineries with domestic refined product markets and with our speedway retail, Marathon brand marketing operations. Our speedway retail demand, Marathon brand marketing and other wholesale arrangements provide an assured domestic outlet for approximately 60% of our refinery gasoline production. Our speedway retail business is taking the other business we intend to grow through the combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions. For example, the 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana purchased by Speedway during the second quarter of 2011 continued to perform very well, and we continue to look for similar acquisition opportunities.
To quickly recap, we are balanced geographically. About 50% of our Refining and Marketing business is in the attractive PADD II market with access to growing inland crude production that could benefit our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries. The other half of our refining capacity is in the Gulf Coast, with exposure to attractive export markets. We have a balanced crude slate with flexibility to process price advantaged crudes throughout our entire refining system. We have a significant margin enhancement project in our refinery to increase our ability to process even more heavy Canadian crude.
And finally, we have diverse sources of earnings and cash flow from our Pipeline Transportation and Speedway retail businesses that have been less cyclical than refining.
Before I turn it over to Mike Palmer, I want to address a question on the minds of many of our investors. What are we going to do with the cash on our balance sheet and the free cash we expect to generate in the future? We gave part of that answer on October 26 when our board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. We are committed to a balanced approach between disciplined investment in the business and returning capital to shareholders in the most appropriate form, given the many different considerations that will exist over time.
We have taken nothing off the table as we evaluated return of capital to our shareholders. However, it is important to understand our ability to issue or retire equity is not solely within our control. The spinoff of MPC from Marathon Oil was a tax-free transaction and we agreed with Marathon Oil for a period of 2 years generally not to issue or repurchase stock without their consent. We also note that the world can change very quickly. Not long ago there was very limited liquidity in the market. Given limitations in our ability to use equity over the next 2 years, we will be disciplined as we evaluate all uses of cash from investment and return of capital to shareholders. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mike Palmer to discuss our feedstock flexibility."

One of our major objectives every day is to optimize our crude slates.

One of our major objectives every day is to optimize our crude slates. We purchased those crude oils that will deliver the highest profitability through a combination of price, transportation costs and finished product yield value. We have developed the flexibility in terms of our logistics system, our contract mix and our business process to achieve this objective.
We have a logistics system that provides access to Canadian crude from the North, Mid-Continent crude from the West, crude production from the U.S. Gulf Coast and waterborne crude from virtually anywhere in the world through LOOP, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. With volatile crude oil spread, logistics flexibility is one of the keys to long-term success in this business.
During the third quarter, we continued to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet, and between sweet and sour crudes. Approximately 50% of the crude we processed last quarter was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase our throughput of Canadian heavy and crude price off WTI to about 38%, up approximately 35% in the second quarter and 33% in the first quarter.
WTI priced crudes represented 27% of the crude we refined during the third quarter of 2011, up from 21% in the same quarter last year. An example of what we are doing to utilize more WTI-linked crude would be our efforts at the Canton refinery to purchase Utica shale oil. We have installed a temporary truck rack that gives us the immediate ability to receive up to 1,000 barrels per day of this new production. We have engineering under way to install a permanent truck unloading facility with capacity up to 12,000 barrels per day by early next year. We are studying other options to significantly increase our overall system logistics capability as production in the Utica ramps up.
We are currently seeing very attractively priced Canadian sweet synthetic crude oil that fits our Midwest system very well. We have been utilizing the Keystone pipeline to Patoka to take advantage of this opportunity and expect it to continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. We expect U.S. inland crude production in large part due to shale plays such as the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and Utica and Canadian production to continue to show significant growth. As a result of this growth, we expect differentials for these crude oils to be favorable well into the foreseeable future. We will continue to debottleneck and enhance our logistics to allow us to take advantage of this growth. 
Don Templin will now go over the results for the quarter."

Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16",1170,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16 for the third quarter compared to $0.77 during the same period last year. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 6 shows by segment the change in net income from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing segment income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 third quarter, our effective income tax rate was 35% compared with 37% in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction.
I also wanted to explain the $51 million in other items. This variance primarily relates to costs associated with being a stand-alone company, including some onetime transition cost, as well as higher incentive compensation due to our strong results in 2011 and the interest expense on our $3 billion in senior notes. 
As shown on Slide 7, Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $352 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily the result of a higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide.
Slide 8 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the third quarter. Our gross margin in the third quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider sweet sour differential, higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads and a wider WTI LLS differential. The sweet sour differential increased approximately 48% from an average of $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter 2011 to $11.94 per barrel in the third quarter of '11. The benchmark for our blended Chicago U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $2.83 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 to $5.98 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011.
In addition, the WTI LLS differential averaged $22.92 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011. This was an increase of $19.49 per barrel compared to an average of $3.43 per barrel in the third quarter 2010.
Not reflected in these industry metrics are a number of other factors that impact our gross margin, such as differences between the spot price of refined products used in the crack spread calculation and our actual sales price. In addition, our average refinery inputs were 1,368,000  barrels per day during the 2011 third quarter compared with 1,445,000 barrels per day during the same quarter last year. The 77,000-barrel per day decline from the third quarter last year primarily reflects the impact of the sale of our Minnesota refinery in December 2010.
Speedway's income from operations was $85 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $105 million in the third quarter of 2010. The $20 million decline in income from operations is almost entirely attributable to the absence of the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. 
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales decreased 2% and merchandise sales increased 2% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same quarter of last year. The lower same-store gasoline sales primarily reflect the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.52 per gallon during the third quarter of 2011 compared with $2.64 per gallon last year. Same-store gasoline sales volumes in October 2011 are up slightly to the comparable period last year.
Slide 10 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $56 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $39 million in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement is primarily attributable to the absence of nonroutine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010, partially offset by less equity affiliate income in the 2011 third quarter.
The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the third quarter of 2011. At September 30, 2011, our cash balance was just under $3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was nearly $1.5 billion. The working capital benefit of $238 million noted on this slide primarily relates to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory and increases in our payables since June 30. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $317 million, primarily related to our Detroit heavy oil refinery project.
The first federal income tax return we will file as a separate company will be for a short 6-month tax year. Federal income tax rules allow us to make an initial estimated tax payment on December 15 rather than making payments in each of the quarters. As a result, our cash flows for the third quarter of 2011 did not include any estimated federal income tax payments. The company currently projects its December 15 estimated federal tax payment will include the liability of between $400 million and $500 million related to the third quarter earnings. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items.
Slide 12 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had over $2.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 3%. Along with our $2.9 billion in cash, we have an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility and an undrawn $1 billion trade receivable securitization facility. This should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing bottom line growth opportunities. As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2011.
While it is hard to predict what will happen to crack spreads and differentials for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on what we have seen in the market during the month of October. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads have decreased in October compared to the third quarter. The preliminary crack spreads are $2.15 and $2.48 for October, for Chicago and Gulf Coast, respectively. The sweet sour differential averaged $5.46 in October, and the WTI LLS differential averaged $25.65. As you know, our historical increase in corporate cost do not reflect all of the cost of operating as a stand-alone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $80 million pretax on a normalized annualized basis. Finally, assuming no special items during the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the overall effective income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year.
Now I will turn the call over to back to Pam Beall."

Back to your question on PADD IV versus PADD II and I really think about how to pipelines move. Today, all of PAD IV is saturated with the amount of crude that goes directly to the refineries and the majority of that is going to go either by either gathering system or truck. So I definitely agree with Mike that the systems as you export and all those systems again will move west to east or a little bit south and then to the east that I believe that they will go hand in hand because all of those refineries today will be completely full with those type of production is coming out of the Canada, the Bakken, the Niobrara and some of those areas."

We had a very strong third quarter with $1.1 billion of net income, which is close to a record for our company. We executed on our ability to capture several of the key market drivers in our business, including the crack spreads in our geographic markets, the differential between our sweet and sour crude basket and the spread between West Texas Intermediate price crudes and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet.
I'm going to ask Mike Palmer, our Senior VP of Supply, Distribution and Planning to go into a little more detail about the crudes we process and how we are positioned to optimize the crude slate across our refineries to produce the highest value finished product yields. But first, I want to explain our balanced approach to business.
Clearly, the WTI LLS spread is attractive today, and our earnings benefited from this market condition. We've been successful in this business a long time, and we have structured our logistical and refining assets so that our future earnings and cash flow are not riding just on the wide WTI LLS spread. Market conditions are always changing, and the current price differential between WTI and LLS won't be an exception. But having said that, we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growth of inland crude production, and we are investing in our logistics system to ensure we have access to the growing sources of crudes that are priced off of WTI, as well as Canadian crudes.
Now I would like to elaborate on what I mean by a balanced approach to our business. First, we have a balanced crude slate, refining nearly 50% sour and 50% sweet crude. We have the flexibility to alter our sweet and sour crude slate in any given quarter in response to market conditions. Second, we're balancing our geographic markets with a little over 50% of our refining capacity in PADD II. This PADD II capacity is well positioned to refine increased Canadian crude production, as well as the prospective Utica crude production. We also have the advantage of being able to move WTI feedstocks through our logistics system to our PADD II refineries. 
Further strengthening our PADD II position, upgrades to our Detroit refinery were approximately 73% complete as of September 30, 2011. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. And when completed, these upgrades should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, reducing our feedstock cost and increasing Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
It is also important to note that PADD II is a net short of refined products. So we tend to run our plants at relatively higher utilization rates and better crack spreads than PADD III refineries. The other half of our crude refining capacity is in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which gives us access to favorable export markets. Our Garyville refinery is the newest, and we believe one of the most efficient refineries in the country. And when we planned the expansion of Garyville, which we completed in 2009, we expected distillate demand to grow faster than gasoline demand, and that certainly has been the case. Global demand for distillate continues to increase, providing the opportunity to increase distillate exports to higher-value global markets. 
During the third quarter, we continued the optimization of Garyville, which is running significantly above its nameplate capacity. We also increased the amount of distillates sold for export from Garyville to approximately 73,000 barrels per day last quarter. With modest additional investment, we believe we can increase our distillate for sales export even more, providing us with additional options to place more of our refinery production in higher value markets.
Another point of balance in our business is our integrated approach in using our significant logistics operations to connect our refineries with domestic refined product markets and with our Speedway retail, Marathon brand marketing operations. Our Speedway retail demand, Marathon brand marketing and other wholesale arrangements provide an assured domestic outlet for approximately 60% of our refinery gasoline production. Our Speedway retail business is the segment of the business we intend to grow through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions. For example, the 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana purchased by Speedway during the second quarter of 2011 continued to perform very well, and we continue to look for similar acquisition opportunities.
To quickly recap, we are balanced geographically. About 50% of our Refining and Marketing business is in the attractive PADD II market with access to growing inland crude production that could benefit our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries. The other half of our refining capacity is in the Gulf Coast, with exposure to attractive export markets. We have a balanced crude slate with a flexibility to process price-advantaged crudes throughout our entire refining system. We have a significant margin enhancement project at our Detroit refinery to increase our ability to process even more heavy Canadian crude.
And finally, we have diverse sources of earnings and cash flow from our Pipeline Transportation and Speedway retail businesses that have been less cyclical than refining.
Before I turn it over to Mike Palmer, I want to address a question on the minds of many of our investors. What are we going to do with the cash on our balance sheet and the free cash we expect to generate in the future? We gave part of that answer on October 26 when our board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. We are committed to a balanced approach between disciplined investment in the business and returning capital to shareholders in the most appropriate form, given the many different considerations that will exist over time.
We have taken nothing off the table as we evaluate return of capital to our shareholders. However, it is important to understand our ability to issue or retire equity is not solely within our control. The spinoff of MPC from Marathon Oil was a tax-free transaction, and we agreed with Marathon Oil for a period of 2 years generally not to issue or repurchase stock without their consent. We also know that the world can change very quickly. Not long ago there was very limited liquidity in the market. Given limitations in our ability to use equity over the next 2 years, we will be disciplined as we evaluate all uses of cash for investments and return of capital to shareholders. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mike Palmer to discuss our feedstock flexibility."

One of our major objectives every day is to optimize our crude slates. We purchased those crude oils that will deliver the highest profitability through a combination of price, transportation costs and finished product yield value. We have developed the flexibility in terms of our logistics system, our contract mix and our business process to achieve this objective.
We have a logistics system that provides access to Canadian crude from the North, Mid-Continent crude from the West, crude production from the U.S. Gulf Coast and waterborne crude from virtually anywhere in the world through LOOP, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. With volatile crude oil spreads, logistics flexibility is one of the keys to long-term success in this business.
During the third quarter, we continue to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet, and between sweet and sour crudes. Approximately 50% of the crude we processed last quarter was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase our throughput of Canadian heavy and crude price off WTI to about 38%, up approximately 35% in the second quarter and 33% in the first quarter.
WTI-priced crudes represented 27% of the crude we refined during the third quarter of 2011, up from 21% in the same quarter last year. An example of what we are doing to utilize more WTI-linked crude would be our efforts at the Canton refinery to purchase Utica shale oil. We have installed a temporary truck rack that gives us the immediate ability to receive up to 1,000 barrels per day of this new production. We have engineering under way to install a permanent truck unloading facility with capacity up to 12,000 barrels per day by early next year. We are studying other options to significantly increase our overall system logistics capability as production in the Utica ramps up.
We are currently seeing very attractively priced Canadian sweet synthetic crude oil that fits our Midwest system very well. We have been utilizing the Keystone pipeline to Patoka to take advantage of this opportunity, and expect it to continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. We expect U.S. inland crude production in large part due to shale plays such as the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and Utica, and Canadian production to continue to show significant growth. As a result of this growth, we expect differentials for these crude oils to be favorable well into the foreseeable future. We will continue to debottleneck and enhance our logistics to allow us to take advantage of this growth. 
Don Templin will now go over the financial results  for the quarter."

Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16",1165,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16 for the third quarter compared to $0.77 during the same period last year. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 6 shows by segment the change in net income from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing segment income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 third quarter, our effective income tax rate was 35% compared with 37% in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction.
I also wanted to explain the $51 million in other items. This variance primarily relates to costs associated with being a stand-alone company, including some onetime transition costs, as well as higher incentive compensation due to our strong results in 2011 and the interest expense on our $3 billion in senior notes. 
As shown on Slide 7, Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $352 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily the result of a higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide.
Slide 8 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the third quarter. Our gross margin in the third quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider sweet/sour differential, higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads and a wider WTI LLS differential. The sweet/sour differential increased approximately 48% from an average of $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 to $11.94 per barrel in the third quarter of '11. The benchmark for our blended Chicago U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $2.83 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 to $5.98 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011.
In addition, the WTI LLS differential averaged $22.92 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011. This was an increase of $19.49 per barrel compared to an average of $3.43 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010.
Not reflected in these industry metrics are a number of other factors that impact our gross margin, such as differences between the spot price of refined products used in the crack spread calculation and our actual sales price. In addition, our average refinery inputs were 1,368,000  barrels per day during the 2011 third quarter, compared to 1,445,000 barrels per day during the same quarter last year. The 77,000-barrel per day decline from the third quarter last year primarily reflects the impact of the sale of our Minnesota refinery in December 2010.
Speedway's income from operations was $85 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $105 million in the third quarter of 2010. The $20 million decline in income from operations is almost entirely attributable to the absence of the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. 
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales decreased 2% and merchandise sales increased 2% in the third quarter of 2011, compared with the same quarter of last year. The lower same-store gasoline sales primarily reflect the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.52 per gallon during the third quarter of 2011, compared with $2.64 per gallon last year. Same-store gasoline sales volumes in October 2011 are up slightly to the comparable period last year.
Slide 10 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $56 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $39 million in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement is primarily attributable to the absence of nonroutine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010, partially offset by less equity affiliate income in the 2011 third quarter.
The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the third quarter of 2011. At September 30, 2011, our cash balance was just under $3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was nearly $1.5 billion. The working capital benefit of $238 million noted on this slide primarily relates to decreases in accounts receivable in the inventory and increases in our payables since June 30. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $317 million, primarily related to our Detroit heavy oil refinery project.
The first federal income tax return we will file as a separate company will be for a short 6-month tax year. Federal income tax rules allow us to make an initial estimated tax payment on December 15, rather than making payments in each of the quarters. As a result, our cash flows for the third quarter of 2011 did not include any estimated federal income tax payments. The company currently projects its December 15 estimated federal tax payment will include a liability of between $400 million and $500 million related to the third quarter earnings. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items.
Slide 12 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had over $2.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 3%. Along with our $2.9 billion in cash, we have an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility and an undrawn $1 billion trade receivable securitization facility. This should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing bottom line growth opportunities. As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2011.
While it is hard to predict what will happen to crack spreads and differentials for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on what we've seen in the market during the month of October. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads have decreased in October compared to the third quarter. The preliminary crack spreads are $2.15 and $2.48 for October for Chicago and Gulf Coast, respectively. The sweet/sour differential averaged $5.46 in October, and the WTI/LLS differential averaged $25.65. As you know, our historical pre-spin corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $80 million pretax on a normalized annualized basis. Finally, assuming no special items during the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the overall effective income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year.
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

Today, all of PADD IV is saturated with the amount of crude that goes directly to the refineries, and the majority of that is going to go either by either gathering system or truck. So I definitely agree with Mike that the systems as you export all those systems again will move west to east or a little bit south and then to the east, that I believe that they will go hand in hand because all of those refineries today will be completely full with those type of production is coming out of either Canada, the Bakken, the Niobrara, some of those areas."

We had a very strong third quarter with $1.1 billion of net income, which is close to a record for our company. We executed on our ability to capture several of the key market drivers in our business, including the crack spreads in our geographic markets, the differential between our sweet and sour crude basket and the spread between West Texas Intermediate price crudes and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet.
I'm going to ask Mike Palmer, our Senior VP of Supply, Distribution and Planning to go into a little more detail about the crudes we process and how we are positioned to optimize the crude slate across our refineries to produce the highest value finished product yields. But first, I want to explain our balanced approach to business.
Clearly, the WTI LLS spread is attractive today, and our earnings benefited from this market condition. We've been successful in this business a long time, and we have structured our logistical and refining assets so that our future earnings and cash flow are not riding just on the wide WTI LLS spread. Market conditions are always changing, and the current price differential between WTI and LLS won't be an exception. But having said that, we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growth of inland crude production, and we are investing in our logistics system to ensure we have access to the growing sources of crudes that are priced off of WTI, as well as Canadian crudes.
Now I would like to elaborate on what I mean by a balanced approach to our business. First, we have a balanced crude slate, refining nearly 50% sour and 50% sweet crude. We have the flexibility to alter our sweet and sour crude slate in any given quarter in response to market conditions. Second, we're balancing our geographic markets with a little over 50% of our refining capacity in PADD II. This PADD II capacity is well positioned to refine increased Canadian crude production, as well as the prospective Utica crude production. We also have the advantage of being able to move WTI linked feedstocks through our logistics system to our PADD II refineries. 
Further strengthening our PADD II position, upgrades to our Detroit refinery were approximately 73% complete as of September 30, 2011. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. And when completed, these upgrades should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, reducing our feedstock cost and increasing Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
It is also important to note that PADD II is a net short of refined products. So we tend to run our plants at relatively higher utilization rates and better crack spreads than PADD III refineries. The other half of our crude refining capacity is in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which gives us access to favorable export markets. Our Garyville refinery is the newest, and we believe one of the most efficient refineries in the country. And when we planned the expansion of Garyville, which we completed in 2009, we expected distillate demand to grow faster than gasoline demand, and that certainly has been the case. Global demand for distillate continues to increase, providing the opportunity to increase distillate exports to higher-value global markets. 
During the third quarter, we continued the optimization of Garyville, which is running significantly above its nameplate capacity. We also increased the amount of distillates sold for export from Garyville to approximately 73,000 barrels per day last quarter. With modest additional investment, we believe we can increase our distillate for sales export even more, providing us with additional options to place more of our refinery production in higher value markets.
Another point of balance in our business is our integrated approach in using our significant logistics operations to connect our refineries with domestic refined product markets and with our Speedway retail, Marathon brand marketing operations. Our Speedway retail demand, Marathon brand marketing and other wholesale arrangements provide an assured domestic outlet for approximately 60% of our refinery gasoline production. Our Speedway retail business is the segment of the business we intend to grow through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions. For example, the 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana purchased by Speedway during the second quarter of 2011 continued to perform very well, and we continue to look for similar acquisition opportunities.
To quickly recap, we are balanced geographically. About 50% of our Refining and Marketing business is in the attractive PADD II market with access to growing inland crude production that could benefit our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries. The other half of our refining capacity is in the Gulf Coast, with exposure to attractive export markets. We have a balanced crude slate with a flexibility to process price-advantaged crudes throughout our entire refining system. We have a significant margin enhancement project at our Detroit refinery to increase our ability to process even more heavy Canadian crude.
And finally, we have diverse sources of earnings and cash flow from our Pipeline Transportation and Speedway retail businesses that have been less cyclical than refining.
Before I turn it over to Mike Palmer, I want to address a question on the minds of many of our investors. What are we going to do with the cash on our balance sheet and the free cash we expect to generate in the future? We gave part of that answer on October 26 when our board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. We are committed to a balanced approach between disciplined investment in the business and returning capital to shareholders in the most appropriate form, given the many different considerations that will exist over time.
We have taken nothing off the table as we evaluate return of capital to our shareholders. However, it is important to understand our ability to issue or retire equity is not solely within our control. The spinoff of MPC from Marathon Oil was a tax-free transaction, and we agreed with Marathon Oil for a period of 2 years generally not to issue or repurchase stock without their consent. We also know that the world can change very quickly. Not long ago there was very limited liquidity in the market. Given limitations in our ability to use equity over the next 2 years, we will be disciplined as we evaluate all uses of cash for investments and return of capital to shareholders. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mike Palmer to discuss our feedstock flexibility."

One of our major objectives every day is to optimize our crude slates.

One of our major objectives every day is to optimize our crude slates. We purchased those crude oils that will deliver the highest profitability through a combination of price, transportation costs and finished product yield value. We have developed the flexibility in terms of our logistics system, our contract mix and our business process to achieve this objective.
We have a logistics system that provides access to Canadian crude from the North, Mid-Continent crude from the West, crude production from the U.S. Gulf Coast and waterborne crude from virtually anywhere in the world through LOOP, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. With volatile crude oil spreads, logistics flexibility is one of the keys to long-term success in this business.
During the third quarter, we continue to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet, and between sweet and sour crudes. Approximately 50% of the crude we processed last quarter was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase our throughput of Canadian heavy and crude price off WTI to about 38%, up approximately 35% in the second quarter and 33% in the first quarter.
WTI-priced crudes represented 27% of the crude we refined during the third quarter of 2011, up from 21% in the same quarter last year. An example of what we are doing to utilize more WTI-linked crude would be our efforts at the Canton refinery to purchase Utica shale oil. We have installed a temporary truck rack that gives us the immediate ability to receive up to 1,000 barrels per day of this new production. We have engineering under way to install a permanent truck unloading facility with capacity up to 12,000 barrels per day by early next year. We are studying other options to significantly increase our overall system logistics capability as production in the Utica ramps up.
We are currently seeing very attractively priced Canadian sweet synthetic crude oil that fits our Midwest system very well. We have been utilizing the Keystone pipeline to Patoka to take advantage of this opportunity, and expect it to continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. We expect U.S. inland crude production in large part due to shale plays such as the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and Utica, and Canadian production to continue to show significant growth. As a result of this growth, we expect differentials for these crude oils to be favorable well into the foreseeable future. We will continue to debottleneck and enhance our logistics to allow us to take advantage of this growth. 
Don Templin will now go over the financial results  for the quarter."

Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16",1165,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides net income both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion reflects an $856 million increase from the $277 million earned in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share was $3.16 for the third quarter compared to $0.77 during the same period last year. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 6 shows by segment the change in net income from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing segment income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 third quarter, our effective income tax rate was 35% compared with 37% in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction.
I also wanted to explain the $51 million in other items. This variance primarily relates to costs associated with being a stand-alone company, including some onetime transition costs, as well as higher incentive compensation due to our strong results in 2011 and the interest expense on our $3 billion in senior notes. 
As shown on Slide 7, Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $352 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily the result of a higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide.
Slide 8 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the third quarter. Our gross margin in the third quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider sweet/sour differential, higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads and a wider WTI LLS differential. The sweet/sour differential increased approximately 48% from an average of $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 to $11.94 per barrel in the third quarter of '11. The benchmark for our blended Chicago U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $2.83 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 to $5.98 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011.
In addition, the WTI LLS differential averaged $22.92 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011. This was an increase of $19.49 per barrel compared to an average of $3.43 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010.
Not reflected in these industry metrics are a number of other factors that impact our gross margin, such as differences between the spot price of refined products used in the crack spread calculation and our actual sales price. In addition, our average refinery inputs were 1,368,000  barrels per day during the 2011 third quarter, compared to 1,445,000 barrels per day during the same quarter last year. The 77,000-barrel per day decline from the third quarter last year primarily reflects the impact of the sale of our Minnesota refinery in December 2010.
Speedway's income from operations was $85 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $105 million in the third quarter of 2010. The $20 million decline in income from operations is almost entirely attributable to the absence of the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. 
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales decreased 2% and merchandise sales increased 2% in the third quarter of 2011, compared with the same quarter of last year. The lower same-store gasoline sales primarily reflect the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.52 per gallon during the third quarter of 2011, compared with $2.64 per gallon last year. Same-store gasoline sales volumes in October 2011 are up slightly to the comparable period last year.
Slide 10 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $56 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $39 million in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement is primarily attributable to the absence of nonroutine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010, partially offset by less equity affiliate income in the 2011 third quarter.
The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the third quarter of 2011. At September 30, 2011, our cash balance was just under $3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was nearly $1.5 billion. The working capital benefit of $238 million noted on the slide primarily relates to decreases in accounts receivable in the inventory and increases in our payables since June 30. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $317 million, primarily related to our Detroit heavy oil refinery project.
The first federal income tax return we will file as a separate company will be for a short 6-month tax year. Federal income tax rules allow us to make an initial estimated tax payment on December 15, rather than making payments in each of the quarters. As a result, our cash flows for the third quarter of 2011 did not include any estimated federal income tax payments. The company currently projects its December 15 estimated federal tax payment will include a liability of between $400 million and $500 million related to the third quarter earnings. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items.
Slide 12 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had over $2.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 3%. Along with our $2.9 billion in cash, we have an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility and an undrawn $1 billion trade receivable securitization facility. This should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing bottom line growth opportunities. As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2011.
While it is hard to predict what will happen to crack spreads and differentials for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on what we've seen in the market during the month of October. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads have decreased in October compared to the third quarter. The preliminary crack spreads are $2.15 and $2.48 for October for Chicago and Gulf Coast, respectively. The sweet/sour differential averaged $5.46 in October, and the WTI/LLS differential averaged $25.65. As you know, our historical pre-spin corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $80 million pretax on a normalized annualized basis. Finally, assuming no special items during the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the overall effective income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year.
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing in place",620,"Thank you, Pam. If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing in place to operate as a best-in-class independent downstream company. We have a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating and a number of projects under way that we believe position us well for earnings and cash flow growth. On July 27, 2011, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable on September 12, 2011, to the shareholders of record on August 17, 2011.
During the second quarter, we continued the optimization of our expanded Garyville refinery an increased our distillate exports from Garyville to approximately 70,000 barrels of oil per day. With modest additional investments, we believe we can increase our distillate exports providing us with additional options to place production in higher value markets. Upgrades started refinery are approximately 63% complete. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. This project will allow us -- say, should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, lower our feedstock cost and increase Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
During the second quarter, we continue to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crude as well as the differential between LLS and our normal slate of sour crudes. This increased our income from operations despite further signs of a weak economy. During the second quarter, 50% of the crude we processed were sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase the amount of the crude we processed that was linked to WTI pricing and Canadian heavy to about 35% up from approximately 33% in the first quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of 2010. If oil production in North America continues to grow faster than the logistics to deliver this production to consuming markets, we expect wider differentials to continue. 
During the second quarter of 2011, Speedway completed the purchase of 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest, Indiana which strengthens its presence in this important geographic area. All of the locations have been rebranded on the Speedway flag, and we are very pleased with the initial results of these operations. This is a segment of the business we intend to grow in contiguous areas through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions.
At our Speedway retail business, we realized strong gasoline and distillate gross margins during the quarter. This partially offset the impact of lower gasoline and distillate sales volumes, primarily associated with our 166 convenience stores sold as part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The spinoff of Marathon Petroleum from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011 was the right transaction at the right time. Our fully integrated approach and sharp business focus provides operational flexibility and the ability to efficiently move petroleum-related products to our system.
Looking ahead, not only do we expect to continue to benefit from the Garyville expansion, which is in full production and is operating above its nameplate clued auto refining capacity, but also our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrading Project should come online during the second half of next year. We are also optimistic about the growth prospects to our Speedway retail operations. We expect these investments to enhance our earnings and our cash flow for many years to come. 
And now I'll turn it over to Don Templin who will review the financial results for the quarter. Don?"

Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 20",1169,"Thank you, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 2010. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our adjusted net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 second quarter, the effective income tax rate was 40% compared with 37% in the second quarter of 2010.
Our 2011 tax rate was impacted by changes in state income tax legislation, primarily in Michigan. This resulted in a $17 million tax charge during the 2011 second quarter that has been treated as a special item. 
The Refining and Marketing variance analysis is shown on Slide 6. Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $590 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide. Before I do that, I wanted to explain the $63 million in other items. This change is primarily due to higher refined product transportation costs and incremental incentive compensation accrual due to our strong results during the first half of 2011. 
Slide 7 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the second quarter. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider WTI LLS differential, a wider sweet/sour differential and higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads.
The WTI LLS differential increased nearly $12 per barrel from an average of $4.11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $16.09 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. The sweet/sour differential increased approximately 25% from an average of $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $11.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. 
In addition, our blended Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $3.20 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $5.53 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011.
Our average refinery inputs were 1,372,000 barrels per day or 21,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of last year. This primarily reflects the impact of the December 2010 sale of the Minnesota refinery, partially offset by the Garyville major expansion, which is operating at higher rates than the comparable quarter last year. I should also mention that our Refining and Marketing results included higher derivative gains in the 2011 second quarter compared with the same period last year. While the pricing mechanism we have in place for domestic crudes allows us to price some close to the time they are refined without the use of derivatives, our foreign crude purchases start pricing as much as 2 months before we process them. As a result, we use derivatives to float the price of our foreign crude purchases until closer to the time we begin processing them. As a result, during the 2011 second quarter, derivative gains totaled $234 million compared with $73 million in the 2010 second quarter.
Turning to Slide 8, Speedway's income from operations was $80 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $83 million in the second quarter of 2010. Speedway's gasoline and distillate gross margin was about $10 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The higher gasoline and distillate gross margin, which increased from $0.117 per gallon in the second quarter of 2010 to $0.15 per gallon in the second quarter of 2011 was partially offset by lower refined product sales volume. These reduced the volumes were primarily associated with the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The lower merchandise gross margin dollars and lower expenses in the second quarter of 2011 also primarily reflects the effects of the Minnesota asset disposition.
Same-store gasoline sales decreased 5% and same-store merchandise sales were flat in the second quarter 2011 compared with the 2010 second quarter. The lower same-store sales reflect weaker demand and the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. The average retail gasoline price was $3.74 per gallon during the second quarter of 2011 compared with $2.69 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In July 2011, we continued to see lower demand with within approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales, which we believe is a result of the weaker economic recovery in the United States. 
Slide 9 shows the Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $48 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily associated with increased volumes that were transported.
The table on Slide 10 provides an analysis of cash flows for the second quarter of 2011. At June 30, 2011, our cash balance was $1,622,000,000. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1,068,000 million. The working capital changes of $1,031,000,000 noted on the slide primarily relate to a seasonal increase in inventory volume. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $345 million, primarily related to our Detroit heavy oil refinery project and the acquisition of 23 convenience stores. This slide also reflects the various cash movements required to implement this transaction. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.3 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items. 
Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 16%. On July 1, 2011, we completed a new trade receivable securitization facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1 billion. Along with our $1.6 billion in cash and our $2 billion revolving credit facility, this should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing organic growth opportunities and selective acquisitions.
As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for 2011 versus 1.1 million barrels per day for 2010 in spite of the fact that we sold the Minnesota refinery effective December 1, 2010. As you know, our historical corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $50 million pretax on a normalized annual basis.
Finally, assuming no other special items during the remainder of 2011, we expect the overall income tax rate to be approximately 38% for the full year. 
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

Can you talk about some of the solutions you see? I think everyone is familiar with a longer-term pipeline options. But before those pipelines margin that's something I think Marathon has an expertise in, what is the practical capacity that you can take barging volumes through? Can you give any economics of the kind of differential or cost associated with that and maybe beyond barging? What are some of the shorter term option you see before the pipeline solutions come into play?"

We go back to the first part of the year and really review the sweet, light sweet crude that are required in the world because the ultralow sulfur fuels that need to be manufactured in Europe and some other refineries in Asia, that's number 1, followed by the Libya problems. And so really depends on when we see Libya crude coming on that might affect the total global value of Brent and therefore, pulling LLS along with that. So than it bring it back domestically and what happens. And you kind of look of that corridor from Canada all the way to the Gulf Coast. Absolutely, there's a top of a big pipeline that's going to go from pushing down to the Gulf Coast but. As I said many times publicly, I don't believe that is the ultimate answer. It all is going to come back to how much Bakken is produced and what the rate of growth is of growth is in the Bakken. Then you have a new competing factor as you go down to the southern part down towards the Gulf in the Eagle Ford coming on and coming on very strong. At one time, it was determined that just the pipeline to the Gulf Coast will take the pressure off of Cushing and take the pressure of some of these WTI type crudes in the North. But now you have the new pressure point being the Eagle Ford. Yes, partially on the river is a very small solution, I would say, and it's not so much the barge traffic, Arjun, as it is, who has the capacity and how can you load barges in different markets up and down the river is really I think the solution to your question. So today, that number is quite small in context with the total amount of crude that moving into that marketplace. So along with that answer to I think a very complex issue driven by market dynamics and I didn't even get into the incremental Canadian production that's going to be produced and eventually land in the Patoka Wood River market as well. So all of the things I just mentioned are going to compete against each other, which I think lends us towards a wider differentials for a longer period of time."

When you look at the refineries across the Mid-Continent today and those refineries that kind of go from Oklahoma to Ohio, all of those refineries have their own pipeline systems servicing those refineries today. So we don't require incremental pipeline space to be able to get the crude into those refineries. What is really required is some laterals, if you will, to be able to tie in those systems that run to not just Marathon but also refineries in the same region of the country today. And I think the competitive factors that I've mentioned earlier is what's going to still be the kind of the unknown dynamic of how fast this production comes on stream. Yes, eventually there will be some pipelines that can be put into service that may take some of this crude to the water, but I think that is a much longer time coming."

We're seeing for the most part the way the derivatives that we put in place maybe just to step back a minute, Paul, we've a got a lot of conversations about derivatives, many years ago we used to use the synthetic approach to price our domestic barrels, which we're buying. And as you recall, we change that approach on a domestic purchases a few years ago and now we do the calendar month average or we contract with our domestic suppliers to by the crude on a basis that basically is in the same time that we refined the crude and refined products. So we are able to price those domestic barrels that we buy basically at the same time as we refine the barrels. The foreign crude, though we don't have that ability to use a contract arrangement to do it, so we use financial instruments and derivatives to essentially allow us to price the crude into our refineries at approximately the same time as we refine them. So we're mimicking, to a pretty a great extent, what is going on with the crack spread indicators because, as you know, the crack spread is basically nothing more than comparing the current spot values of the refined products to the prompt month price of crude, which is next month's price. So in our case, what we're doing with those derivatives and you're right, when we get into LIFO we are -- once we take those barrels into the take title to them, they come into our system. But basically, the answer is all we doing is mimicking the crack spreads that will follow every day in terms of what we make on those barrels in that particular month."

And let me kind of step back and help everyone recall the second quarter of 2010 and how we led through the balance of the year. And really as I want everybody to call, that there was some circumstances outside of our control or anybody else's control that I think really changed a lot of market dynamics of our customer for buying their transportation fuels in the second, third and partially the fourth quarter of last year. But specifically, the second quarter of 2010, we were up 5% when the market was probably only up about 1% or so. So we picked up a lot of volume that I think was being switched from some other refiners during that period of time. Now this year, we're comparing ourselves on a same-store basis against the same period last year, and we're down, we said, 4%, 4.5% in the second quarter of 2011. So really, we're compared against a very big increase in the same quarter last year, and now we hear the market is down this year in the 2% range. So we've still been able to hang on to some of that market share we picked up last year. But clearly, we didn't hang on to all of that. Then in July, we're comparing against last year we were up about 10% in the month of July on a same-store basis. So we certainly wouldn't expect to hang on to that same amount this year and we're down this year of almost 4% versus being up 10% last year. So you can see in July, we're still hanging on to a lot of the market share we picked up, but those -- that big circumstance really was outside of our control last year."

If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing",626,"Thank you, Pam. If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing in place to operate as a best-in-class independent downstream company. We have a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating and a number of projects under way that we believe position us well for earnings and cash flow growth. On July 27 of 2011, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable on September 12 of 2011, to the shareholders of record on August 17 of 2011.
During the second quarter, we continued the optimization of our expanded Garyville refinery and increased our distillate exports from Garyville to approximately 70,000 barrels per day. With modest additional investments, we believe we can increase our distillate exports, providing us with additional options to place production in higher-value markets. Upgrades to our Detroit refinery are approximately 63% complete. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. This project will allow us -- I should say, should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, lower our feedstock cost and increase Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes, as well as the differential between LLS and our normal slate of sour crudes. This increased our income from operations despite further signs of a weak economy. During the second quarter, 50% of the crude we processed was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase the amount of the crude we processed that was linked to WTI pricing and Canadian heavy to about 35%, up from approximately 33% in the first quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of 2010. If oil production in North America continues to grow faster than the logistics to deliver this production to consuming markets, we expect wider differentials to continue. 
During the second quarter of 2011, Speedway completed the purchase of 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana, which strengthens its presence in this important geographic area. All of the locations have been rebranded under the Speedway flag, and we are very pleased with the initial results of these operations. This is a segment of the business we intend to grow in contageous [ph] areas through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions.
At our Speedway retail business, we realized strong gasoline and distillate gross margins during the quarter. This partially offset the impact of lower gasoline and distillate sales volumes, primarily associated with our 166 convenience stores sold as part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The spinoff of Marathon Petroleum from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011, was the right transaction at the right time. Our fully integrated approach and sharp business focus provide operational flexibility and the ability to efficiently move petroleum-related products through our system.
Looking ahead, not only do we expect to continue to benefit from the Garyville expansion, which is in full production and is operating above its nameplate crude oil refining capacity, but also our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrading Project should come online during the second half of next year. We are also optimistic about the growth prospects for our Speedway retail operations. We expect these investments to enhance our earnings and our cash flow for many years to come. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Don Templin, who will review the financial results for the quarter. Don?"

Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 20",1167,"Thank you, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 2010. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our adjusted net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 second quarter, the effective income tax rate was 40% compared with 37% in the second quarter of 2010.
Our 2011 tax rate was impacted by changes in state income tax legislation, primarily in Michigan. This resulted in a $17 million tax charge during the 2011 second quarter that has been treated as a special item. 
The Refining and Marketing variance analysis is shown on Slide 6. Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $590 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide. Before I do that, I wanted to explain the $63 million in other items. This change is primarily due to higher refined product transportation costs and incremental incentive compensation accrual due to our strong results during the first half of 2011. 
Slide 7 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the second quarter. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider WTI-LLS differential, a wider sweet-sour differential and higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads.
The WTI-LLS differential has clearly increased nearly $12 per barrel from an average of $4.11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $16.09 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. The sweet-sour differential increased approximately 25% from an average of $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $11.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. 
In addition, our blended Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $3.20 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $5.53 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011.
Our average refinery inputs were 1,372,000 barrels per day or 21,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of last year. This primarily reflects the impact of the December 2010 sale of the Minnesota refinery, partially offset by the Garyville major expansion, which is operating at higher rates than the comparable quarter last year. I should also mention that our Refining and Marketing results included higher derivative gains in the 2011 second quarter compared with the same period last year. While the pricing mechanism we have in place for domestic crudes allows us to price them close to the time they're refined without the use of derivatives, our foreign crude purchases start pricing as much as 2 months before we process them. As a result, we use derivatives to float the price of our foreign crude purchases until closer to the time we begin processing them. As a result, during the 2011 second quarter, derivative gains totaled $234 million compared with $73 million in the 2010 second quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Speedway's income from operations was $80 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $83 million in the second quarter of 2010. Speedway's gasoline and distillate gross margin was about $10 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The higher gasoline and distillate gross margin, which increased from $0.117 per gallon in the second quarter of 2010 to $0.15 per gallon in the second quarter of 2011, was partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. These reduced volumes were primarily associated with the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The lower merchandise gross margin dollars and lower expenses in the second quarter of 2011 also primarily reflects the effects of the Minnesota asset disposition.
Same-store gasoline sales decreased 5% and same-store merchandise sales were flat in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the 2010 second quarter. The lower same-store sales reflect weaker demand and the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. The average retail gasoline price was $3.74 per gallon during the second quarter of 2011 compared with $2.69 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In July 2011, we continued to see lower demand with an approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales, which we believe is a result of the weak economic recovery in the United States. 
Slide 9 shows the Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $48 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily associated with increased volumes that were transported.
The table on Slide 10 provides an analysis of cash flows for the second quarter of 2011. At June 30, 2011, our cash balance was $1,622,000,000. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1,068,000,000. The working capital changes of $1,031,000,000 noted on the slide primarily relate to a seasonal increase in inventory volumes. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $345 million, primarily related to our Detroit Heavy Oil refinery project and the acquisition of 23 convenience stores. This slide also reflects the various cash movements required to implement this transaction. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.3 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items. 
Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 16%. On July 1, 2011, we completed a new trade receivable securitization facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1 billion. Along with our $1.6 billion in cash and our $2 billion revolving credit facility, this should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing organic growth opportunities and selective acquisitions.
As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for 2011 versus 1.1 million barrels per day for 2010 in spite of the fact that we sold the Minnesota refinery effective December 1, 2010. As you know, our historical corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $50 million pretax on a normalized annual basis.
Finally, assuming no other special items during the remainder of 2011, we expect the overall income tax rate to be approximately 38% for the full year. 
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

Can you talk about some of the solutions you see? I think everyone's familiar with  the longer-term pipeline options. But before those pipelines barge into something I think Marathon has an expertise in, what is the practical capacity that you can take barging volumes through? Can you give any economics of the kind of differential or costs associated with that? And maybe beyond barging, what are some of the other shorter-term options you see before the pipeline solutions come into play?"

We go back to the first part of the year and really review the sweet, light sweet crudes that are required in the world, because of the ultralow sulfur fuels that need to be manufactured in Europe and some other refineries in Asia, that's number one, followed by the Libya problems. And so it really depends on when we see Libya crude coming on. That might affect the total global value of Brent and therefore, pulling LLS along with that. So then I'd bring you back domestically and what happens, and you kind of look out that corridor from Canada, all the way to the Gulf Coast. Absolutely, there's a talk of a big pipeline that's going to go from Cushing down to the Gulf Coast. But as I've said many times publicly, I don't believe that is the ultimate answer. It all is going to come back to how much Bakken is produced and what the rate of growth is in the Bakken. Then, you have a new competing factor as you go down to the southern part, down towards the Gulf in the Eagle Ford coming on and coming on very strong. At one time, it was determined that, oh, just the pipelines of the Gulf Coast would take the pressure off of Cushing and take the pressure of some of these WTI-type crudes in the North. But now, you have that new pressure point being the Eagle Ford. Yes, partially on the rivers is a very small solution, I would say. And it's not so much the barge traffic, Arjun, as it is who has the capacity and how can you load barges in different markets up and down the river, is really, I think, the solution to your question. So today, that number is quite small in context with the total amount of crude that's moving into that marketplace. So a long-winded answer to I think a very complex issue driven by market dynamics, and I didn't even get into the incremental Canadian production that's going to be produced and eventually land in the Patoka, Wood River market as well. So all those things I just mentioned are going to compete against each other, which I think lends us towards a wider differentials for a longer period of time."

When you look at the refineries across the Mid-Continent today and those refineries that kind of go from Oklahoma to Ohio, all of those refineries have their own pipeline systems servicing those refineries today. So we don't require incremental pipeline space to be able to get the crude into those refineries. What is really required is some laterals, if you will, to be able to tie in to those systems that run to not just Marathon, but other refineries in the same region of the country today. And I think the competitive factors that I've mentioned earlier is what's going to still be the kind of the unknown dynamic of how fast this production comes on stream. Yes, eventually, there'll be some pipelines that can be put into service that may take some of this crude to the water, but I think that is a much longer time coming."

It's kind of a -- the absolute, we're seeing for the most part, the way the derivatives that we put in place -- maybe just to step back a minute. Paul, we've a got a lot of conversations about derivatives and many years ago, we used to use the synthetic T-plus [ph] approach to price our domestic barrels, which we were buying. And as you recall, we changed that approach on our domestic purchases a few years ago, and now we do the calendar month average or we contract with our domestic suppliers to buy the crude on a basis that, basically, is at the same time that we refine the crude and refine products. So we are able to price those domestic barrels that we buy basically at the same time as we refine the barrels. The foreign crude, though we don't have that ability to use a contract arrangement to do it, so we use financial instruments, derivatives, to essentially allow us to price the crude into our refineries at approximately the same time as we refine them. So we're mimicking, to a pretty a great extent, what is going on with the crack spread indicators. Because, as you know, the crack spread is basically nothing more than comparing the current spot values of the refined products to the prompt month price of crude, which is next month's price. So in our case, what we do with those derivatives, and you're right, when you get into LIFO we are -- once we take those barrels into the -- take title to them, they come into our system. But basically, the answer is that all we're doing is mimicking the crack spreads that all of us follow every day in terms of what are, what we make on those barrels in that particular month."

And let me kind of step back and help everyone recall the second quarter of 2010 and how we led through the balance of the year. And really, as I want everybody to call, that there was some circumstances outside of our control or anybody else's control that I think really changed a lot of market dynamics of our customers for buying their transportation fuels in the second, third and partially, the fourth quarter of last year. But specifically, the second quarter of 2010, we were up 5% when the market was probably only up about 1% or so. So we picked up a lot of volume that I think was being switched from some other refiners during that period of time. Now this year, we're comparing ourselves on a same-store basis against the same period last year, and we're down, we said, 4%, 4.5% in the second quarter of 2011. So really, we're comparing against a very big increase in the same quarter last year, and now, we hear the market is down this year in the 2% range. So we've still been able to hang on to some of that market share we picked up last year, but clearly, we didn't hang on to all of that. Then in July, we're comparing against last year, we were up about 10% in the month of July on a same-store basis. So we certainly wouldn't expect to hang on to that same amount this year, and we're down this year of almost 4% versus being up 10% last year.

118315802,137656129,187054,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pam. If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing",625,"Thank you, Pam. If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing in place to operate as a best-in-class independent downstream company. We have a strong balance sheet, an investment grade credit rating and a number of projects under way that we believe position us well for earnings and cash flow growth. On July 27 of 2011, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable on September 12 of 2011, to the shareholders of record on August 17 of 2011.
During the second quarter, we continued the optimization of our expanded Garyville refinery and increased our distillate exports from Garyville to approximately 70,000 barrels per day. With modest additional investments, we believe we can increase our distillate exports, providing us with additional options to place production in higher-value markets. Upgrades to our Detroit refinery are approximately 63% complete. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. This project will allow us -- I should say, should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, lower our feedstock cost and increase Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes, as well as the differential between LLS and our normal slate of sour crudes. This increased our income from operations despite further signs of a weak economy. During the second quarter, 50% of the crude we processed was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase the amount of the crude we processed that was linked to WTI pricing and Canadian heavy to about 35%, up from approximately 33% in the first quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of 2010. If oil production in North America continues to grow faster than the logistics to deliver this production to consuming markets, we expect wider differentials to continue. 
During the second quarter of 2011, Speedway completed the purchase of 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana, which strengthens its presence in this important geographic area. All of the locations have been rebranded under the Speedway flag, and we are very pleased with the initial results of these operations. This is a segment of the business we intend to grow in contiguous areas through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions.
At our Speedway retail business, we realized strong gasoline and distillate gross margins during the quarter. This partially offset the impact of lower gasoline and distillate sales volumes, primarily associated with our 166 convenience stores sold as part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The spinoff of Marathon Petroleum from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011, was the right transaction at the right time. Our fully integrated approach and sharp business focus provide operational flexibility and the ability to efficiently move petroleum-related products through our system.
Looking ahead, not only do we expect to continue to benefit from the Garyville expansion, which is in full production and is operating above its nameplate crude oil refining capacity, but also our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrading Project should come online during the second half of next year. We are also optimistic about the growth prospects for our Speedway retail operations. We expect these investments to enhance our earnings and our cash flow for many years to come. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Don Templin, who will review the financial results for the quarter. Don?"
118315802,137656129,187054,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 20",1168,"Thank you, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 2010. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our adjusted net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 second quarter, the effective income tax rate was 40% compared with 37% in the second quarter of 2010.
Our 2011 tax rate was impacted by changes in state income tax legislation, primarily in Michigan. This resulted in a $17 million tax charge during the 2011 second quarter that has been treated as a special item. 
The Refining and Marketing variance analysis is shown on Slide 6. Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $590 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide. Before I do that, I wanted to explain the $63 million in other items. This change is primarily due to higher refined product transportation costs and incremental incentive compensation accrual due to our strong results during the first half of 2011. 
Slide 7 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the second quarter. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider WTI-LLS differential, a wider sweet-sour differential and higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads.
The WTI-LLS differential has clearly increased nearly $12 per barrel from an average of $4.11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $16.09 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. The sweet-sour differential increased approximately 25% from an average of $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $11.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. 
In addition, our blended Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $3.20 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $5.53 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011.
Our average refinery inputs were 1,372,000 barrels per day or 21,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of last year. This primarily reflects the impact of the December 2010 sale of the Minnesota refinery, partially offset by the Garyville major expansion, which is operating at higher rates than the comparable quarter last year. I should also mention that our Refining and Marketing results included higher derivative gains in the 2011 second quarter compared with the same period last year. While the pricing mechanism we have in place for domestic crudes allows us to price them close to the time they're refined without the use of derivatives, our foreign crude purchases start pricing as much as 2 months before we process them. As a result, we use derivatives to float the price of our foreign crude purchases until closer to the time we begin processing them. As a result, during the 2011 second quarter, derivative gains totaled $234 million compared with $73 million in the 2010 second quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Speedway's income from operations was $80 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $83 million in the second quarter of 2010. Speedway's gasoline and distillate gross margin was about $10 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The higher gasoline and distillate gross margin, which increased from $0.117 per gallon in the second quarter of 2010 to $0.15 per gallon in the second quarter of 2011, was partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. These reduced volumes were primarily associated with the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The lower merchandise gross margin dollars and lower expenses in the second quarter of 2011 also primarily reflects the effects of the Minnesota asset disposition.
Same-store gasoline sales decreased 5% and same-store merchandise sales were flat in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the 2010 second quarter. The lower same-store sales reflect weaker demand and the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. The average retail gasoline price was $3.74 per gallon during the second quarter of 2011 compared with $2.69 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In July 2011, we continued to see lower demand with an approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales, which we believe is a result of the weak economic recovery in the United States. 
Slide 9 shows the Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $48 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily associated with increased volumes that were transported.
The table on Slide 10 provides an analysis of cash flows for the second quarter of 2011. At June 30, 2011, our cash balance was $1,622,000,000. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1,068,000,000. The working capital changes of $1,031,000,000 noted on the slide primarily relate to a seasonal increase in inventory volumes. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $345 million, primarily related to our Detroit Heavy Oil refinery project and the acquisition of 23 convenience stores. This slide also reflects the various cash movements required to implement this end transaction. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.3 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items. 
Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 16%. On July 1, 2011, we completed a new trade receivable securitization facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1 billion. Along with our $1.6 billion in cash and our $2 billion revolving credit facility, this should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing organic growth opportunities and selective acquisitions.
As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for 2011 versus 1.1 million barrels per day for 2010 in spite of the fact that we sold the Minnesota refinery effective December 1, 2010. As you know, our historical corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $50 million pretax on a normalized annual basis.
Finally, assuming no other special items during the remainder of 2011, we expect the overall income tax rate to be approximately 38% for the full year. 
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

Can you talk about some of the solutions you see? I think everyone's familiar with  the longer-term pipeline options. But before those pipelines barge into something I think Marathon has some expertise in, what is the practical capacity that you can take barging volumes through? Can you give any economics of the kind of differential or costs associated with that? And maybe beyond barging, what are some of the other shorter-term options you see before the pipeline solutions come into play?"

We go back to the first part of the year and really review the sweet, light sweet crudes that are required in the world, because of the ultralow sulfur fuels that need to be manufactured in Europe and some other refineries in Asia, that's number one, followed by the Libya problems. And so it really depends on when we see Libya crude coming on. That might affect the total global value of Brent and therefore, pulling LLS along with that. So then I bring you back domestically and what happens, and you kind of look out that corridor from Canada, all the way to the Gulf Coast. Absolutely, there's a talk of a big pipeline that's going to go from Cushing down to the Gulf Coast. But as I've said many times publicly, I don't believe that is the ultimate answer. It all is going to come back to how much Bakken is produced and what the rate of growth is in the Bakken. Then, you have a new competing factor as you go down to the southern part, down towards the Gulf in the Eagle Ford coming on and coming on very strong. At one time, it was determined that, oh, just the pipelines of the Gulf Coast would take the pressure off of Cushing and take the pressure of some of these WTI-type crudes in the North. But now, you have that new pressure point being the Eagle Ford. Yes, partially on the rivers is a very small solution, I would say. And it's not so much the barge traffic, Arjun, as it is who has the capacity and how can you load barges in different markets up and down the river, is really, I think, the solution to your question. So today, that number is quite small in context with the total amount of crude that's moving into that marketplace. So a long-winded answer to I think a very complex issue driven by market dynamics, and I didn't even get into the incremental Canadian production that's going to be produced and eventually land in the Patoka, Wood River market as well. So all those things I just mentioned are going to compete against each other, which I think lends us towards a wider differentials for a longer period of time."

When you look at the refineries across the Mid-Continent today and those refineries that kind of go from Oklahoma to Ohio, all of those refineries have their own pipeline systems servicing those refineries today. So we don't require incremental pipeline space to be able to get the crude into those refineries. What is really required is some laterals, if you will, to be able to tie in to those systems that run to not just Marathon, but other refineries in the same region of the country today. And I think the competitive factors that I've mentioned earlier is what's going to still be the kind of the unknown dynamic of how fast this production comes on stream. Yes, eventually, there'll be some pipelines that can be put into service that may take some of this crude to the water, but I think that is a much longer time coming."

It's kind of a -- the absolute, we're seeing for the most part, the way the derivatives that we put in place -- maybe just to step back a minute. Paul, we've a got a lot of conversations about derivatives and many years ago, we used to use the synthetic T-plus [ph] approach to price our domestic barrels, which we were buying. And as you recall, we changed that approach on our domestic purchases a few years ago, and now we do the calendar month average or we contract with our domestic suppliers to buy the crude on a basis that, basically, is at the same time that we refine the crude and refine products. So we are able to price those domestic barrels that we buy basically at the same time as we refine the barrels. The foreign crude, though we don't have that ability to use a contract arrangement to do it, so we use financial instruments, derivatives, to essentially allow us to price the crude into our refineries at approximately the same time as we refine them. So we're mimicking, to a pretty a great extent, what is going on with the crack spread indicators. Because, as you know, the crack spread is basically nothing more than comparing the current spot values of the refined products to the prompt month price of crude, which is next month's price. So in our case, what we're doing with those derivatives, and you're right, when you get into LIFO we are -- once we take those barrels into the -- take title to them, they come into our system. But basically, the answer is that all we're doing is mimicking the crack spreads that all of us follow every day in terms of what are, what we make on those barrels in that particular month."

And let me kind of step back and help everyone recall the second quarter of 2010 and how we led through the balance of the year. And really, as I want everybody to recall, that there was some circumstances outside of our control or anybody else's control that I think really changed a lot of market dynamics of our customers for buying their transportation fuels in the second, third and partially, the fourth quarter of last year. But specifically, the second quarter of 2010, we were up 5% when the market was probably only up about 1% or so. So we picked up a lot of volume that I think was being switched from some other refiners during that period of time. Now this year, we're comparing ourselves on a same-store basis against the same period last year, and we're down, we said, 4%, 4.5% in the second quarter of 2011. So really, we're comparing against a very big increase in the same quarter last year, and now, we hear the market is down this year in the 2% range. So we've still been able to hang on to some of that market share we picked up last year, but clearly, we didn't hang on to all of that. Then in July, we're comparing against last year, we were up about 10% in the month of July on a same-store basis. So we certainly wouldn't expect to hang on to that same amount this year, and we're down this year of almost 4% versus being up 10% last year. So you can see in July, we're still hanging on to a lot of the market share we picked up, but those -- that big circumstance really was outside of our control last year."

Here in the Midwest, 8 or 9 states that Speedway operates, we're very pleased with the tremendous integration we have between the gasoline volume and the merchandise sales.

If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing",625,"Thank you, Pam. If you go to Slide 3, as you know, Marathon Petroleum Company Corporation was filed from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011. This transaction was executed as planned and we now have all of our people, processes and financing in place to operate as a best-in-class independent downstream company. We have a strong balance sheet, an investment grade credit rating and a number of projects under way that we believe position us well for earnings and cash flow growth. On July 27 of 2011, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable on September 12 of 2011, to the shareholders of record on August 17 of 2011.
During the second quarter, we continued the optimization of our expanded Garyville refinery and increased our distillate exports from Garyville to approximately 70,000 barrels per day. With modest additional investments, we believe we can increase our distillate exports, providing us with additional options to place production in higher-value markets. Upgrades to our Detroit refinery are approximately 63% complete. This project remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second half of 2012. This project will allow us -- I should say, should allow us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude, lower our feedstock cost and increase Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day.
During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate and other light sweet crudes, as well as the differential between LLS and our normal slate of sour crudes. This increased our income from operations despite further signs of a weak economy. During the second quarter, 50% of the crude we processed was sour. Leveraging our logistics systems, we were able to increase the amount of the crude we processed that was linked to WTI pricing and Canadian heavy to about 35%, up from approximately 33% in the first quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of 2010. If oil production in North America continues to grow faster than the logistics to deliver this production to consuming markets, we expect wider differentials to continue. 
During the second quarter of 2011, Speedway completed the purchase of 23 convenience stores in Chicago, Illinois and Northwest Indiana, which strengthens its presence in this important geographic area. All of the locations have been rebranded under the Speedway flag, and we are very pleased with the initial results of these operations. This is a segment of the business we intend to grow in contiguous areas through a combination of greenfield sites and selective acquisitions.
At our Speedway retail business, we realized strong gasoline and distillate gross margins during the quarter. This partially offset the impact of lower gasoline and distillate sales volumes, primarily associated with our 166 convenience stores sold as part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The spinoff of Marathon Petroleum from Marathon Oil Corporation effective June 30, 2011, was the right transaction at the right time. Our fully integrated approach and sharp business focus provide operational flexibility and the ability to efficiently move petroleum-related products through our system.
Looking ahead, not only do we expect to continue to benefit from the Garyville expansion, which is in full production and is operating above its nameplate crude oil refining capacity, but also our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrading Project should come online during the second half of next year. We are also optimistic about the growth prospects for our Speedway retail operations. We expect these investments to enhance our earnings and our cash flow for many years to come. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Don Templin, who will review the financial results for the quarter. Don?"

Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 20",1168,"Thank you, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted net income of $819 million reflects a 94% increase from the $422 million earned in the second quarter of 2010. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the increase in our adjusted net income was the increase in Refining and Marketing income, partially offset by higher income taxes. For the 2011 second quarter, the effective income tax rate was 40% compared with 37% in the second quarter of 2010.
Our 2011 tax rate was impacted by changes in state income tax legislation, primarily in Michigan. This resulted in a $17 million tax charge during the 2011 second quarter that has been treated as a special item. 
The Refining and Marketing variance analysis is shown on Slide 6. Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $590 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher Refining and Marketing gross margin, which I will discuss on the next slide. Before I do that, I wanted to explain the $63 million in other items. This change is primarily due to higher refined product transportation costs and incremental incentive compensation accrual due to our strong results during the first half of 2011. 
Slide 7 shows a few of the economic drivers contributing to the improved Refining and Marketing gross margin for the second quarter. Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from a wider WTI-LLS differential, a wider sweet-sour differential and higher Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads.
The WTI-LLS differential has clearly increased nearly $12 per barrel from an average of $4.11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $16.09 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. The sweet-sour differential increased approximately 25% from an average of $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $11.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. 
In addition, our blended Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast LLS crack spread increased from $3.20 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010 to $5.53 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011.
Our average refinery inputs were 1,372,000 barrels per day or 21,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of last year. This primarily reflects the impact of the December 2010 sale of the Minnesota refinery, partially offset by the Garyville major expansion, which is operating at higher rates than the comparable quarter last year. I should also mention that our Refining and Marketing results included higher derivative gains in the 2011 second quarter compared with the same period last year. While the pricing mechanism we have in place for domestic crudes allows us to price them close to the time they're refined without the use of derivatives, our foreign crude purchases start pricing as much as 2 months before we process them. As a result, we use derivatives to float the price of our foreign crude purchases until closer to the time we begin processing them. As a result, during the 2011 second quarter, derivative gains totaled $234 million compared with $73 million in the 2010 second quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Speedway's income from operations was $80 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $83 million in the second quarter of 2010. Speedway's gasoline and distillate gross margin was about $10 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The higher gasoline and distillate gross margin, which increased from $0.117 per gallon in the second quarter of 2010 to $0.15 per gallon in the second quarter of 2011, was partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. These reduced volumes were primarily associated with the 166 convenience stores that were part of the December 2010 sale of our Minnesota refinery and related assets. The lower merchandise gross margin dollars and lower expenses in the second quarter of 2011 also primarily reflects the effects of the Minnesota asset disposition.
Same-store gasoline sales decreased 5% and same-store merchandise sales were flat in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the 2010 second quarter. The lower same-store sales reflect weaker demand and the impact of the higher price level of gasoline. The average retail gasoline price was $3.74 per gallon during the second quarter of 2011 compared with $2.69 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In July 2011, we continued to see lower demand with an approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales, which we believe is a result of the weak economic recovery in the United States. 
Slide 9 shows the Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $48 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily associated with increased volumes that were transported.
The table on Slide 10 provides an analysis of cash flows for the second quarter of 2011. At June 30, 2011, our cash balance was $1,622,000,000. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1,068,000,000. The working capital changes of $1,031,000,000 noted on the slide primarily relate to a seasonal increase in inventory volumes. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $345 million, primarily related to our Detroit Heavy Oil refinery project and the acquisition of 23 convenience stores. This slide also reflects the various cash movements required to implement this end transaction. We expect capital spending for the full year 2011 will be approximately $1.3 billion, including approximately $158 million of capitalized interest and corporate items. 
Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. Our cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 16%. On July 1, 2011, we completed a new trade receivable securitization facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1 billion. Along with our $1.6 billion in cash and our $2 billion revolving credit facility, this should provide us with significant flexibility to manage our operations and to pursue value-enhancing organic growth opportunities and selective acquisitions.
As we look forward, we expect our refining crude oil inputs to be approximately 1.2 million barrels per day for 2011 versus 1.1 million barrels per day for 2010 in spite of the fact that we sold the Minnesota refinery effective December 1, 2010. As you know, our historical corporate costs do not reflect all of the costs of operating as a standalone company. We estimate these costs will total an incremental $50 million pretax on a normalized annual basis.
Finally, assuming no other special items during the remainder of 2011, we expect the overall income tax rate to be approximately 38% for the full year. 
Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall."

Can you talk about some of the solutions you see? I think everyone's familiar with  the longer-term pipeline options. But before those pipelines barge into something I think Marathon has some expertise in, what is the practical capacity that you can take barging volumes through? Can you give any economics of the kind of differential or costs associated with that? And maybe beyond barging, what are some of the other shorter-term options you see before the pipeline solutions come into play?"

We go back to the first part of the year and really review the sweet, light sweet crudes that are required in the world, because of the ultralow sulfur fuels that need to be manufactured in Europe and some other refineries in Asia, that's number one, followed by the Libya problems. And so it really depends on when we see Libya crude coming on. That might affect the total global value of Brent and therefore, pulling LLS along with that. So then I bring you back domestically and what happens, and you kind of look out that corridor from Canada, all the way to the Gulf Coast. Absolutely, there's a talk of a big pipeline that's going to go from Cushing down to the Gulf Coast. But as I've said many times publicly, I don't believe that is the ultimate answer. It all is going to come back to how much Bakken is produced and what the rate of growth is in the Bakken. Then, you have a new competing factor as you go down to the southern part, down towards the Gulf in the Eagle Ford coming on and coming on very strong. At one time, it was determined that, oh, just the pipelines of the Gulf Coast would take the pressure off of Cushing and take the pressure of some of these WTI-type crudes in the North. But now, you have that new pressure point being the Eagle Ford. Yes, partially on the rivers is a very small solution, I would say. And it's not so much the barge traffic, Arjun, as it is who has the capacity and how can you load barges in different markets up and down the river, is really, I think, the solution to your question. So today, that number is quite small in context with the total amount of crude that's moving into that marketplace. So a long-winded answer to I think a very complex issue driven by market dynamics, and I didn't even get into the incremental Canadian production that's going to be produced and eventually land in the Patoka, Wood River market as well. So all those things I just mentioned are going to compete against each other, which I think lends us towards a wider differentials for a longer period of time."

When you look at the refineries across the Mid-Continent today and those refineries that kind of go from Oklahoma to Ohio, all of those refineries have their own pipeline systems servicing those refineries today.

And I think the competitive factors that I've mentioned earlier is what's going to still be the kind of the unknown dynamic of how fast this production comes on stream. Yes, eventually, there'll be some pipelines that can be put into service that may take some of this crude to the water, but I think that is a much longer time coming."

It's kind of a -- the absolute, we're seeing for the most part, the way the derivatives that we put in place -- maybe just to step back a minute. Paul, we've a got a lot of conversations about derivatives and many years ago, we used to use the synthetic T-plus [ph] approach to price our domestic barrels, which we were buying. And as you recall, we changed that approach on our domestic purchases a few years ago, and now we do the calendar month average or we contract with our domestic suppliers to buy the crude on a basis that, basically, is at the same time that we refine the crude and refine products. So we are able to price those domestic barrels that we buy basically at the same time as we refine the barrels. The foreign crude, though we don't have that ability to use a contract arrangement to do it, so we use financial instruments, derivatives, to essentially allow us to price the crude into our refineries at approximately the same time as we refine them. So we're mimicking, to a pretty a great extent, what is going on with the crack spread indicators. Because, as you know, the crack spread is basically nothing more than comparing the current spot values of the refined products to the prompt month price of crude, which is next month's price. So in our case, what we're doing with those derivatives, and you're right, when you get into LIFO we are -- once we take those barrels into the -- take title to them, they come into our system. But basically, the answer is that all we're doing is mimicking the crack spreads that all of us follow every day in terms of what are, what we make on those barrels in that particular month."

And let me kind of step back and help everyone recall the second quarter of 2010 and how we led through the balance of the year. And really, as I want everybody to recall, that there was some circumstances outside of our control or anybody else's control that I think really changed a lot of market dynamics of our customers for buying their transportation fuels in the second, third and partially, the fourth quarter of last year. But specifically, the second quarter of 2010, we were up 5% when the market was probably only up about 1% or so. So we picked up a lot of volume that I think was being switched from some other refiners during that period of time. Now this year, we're comparing ourselves on a same-store basis against the same period last year, and we're down, we said, 4%, 4.5% in the second quarter of 2011. So really, we're comparing against a very big increase in the same quarter last year, and now, we hear the market is down this year in the 2% range. So we've still been able to hang on to some of that market share we picked up last year, but clearly, we didn't hang on to all of that. Then in July, we're comparing against last year, we were up about 10% in the month of July on a same-store basis. So we certainly wouldn't expect to hang on to that same amount this year, and we're down this year of almost 4% versus being up 10% last year.
