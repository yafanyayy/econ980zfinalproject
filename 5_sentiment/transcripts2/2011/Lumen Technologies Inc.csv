We appreciate you joining us today as we discussed CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating results, as well as look at operational updates and 2011 guidance information. Now first, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter, for full year 2010. We achieved operating revenues in the fourth quarter that exceeded a top end of our guidance, and diluted earnings per share near the top-end of our guidance, operating revenues for full year 2010  were $7.04 billion, representing ayear-over-year increase of 41.6%, primarily driven by the mid-2009 acquisition of Embarq along with continued growth and strategic revenues. Second, we achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber additions during the fourth quarter and full year 2010 resulting in an annual subscriber growth rate of more than 7%. Additionally, we improved our access line to climb of more than 20% full year 2010 compared to pro forma full-year 2009. We also continued the expansion of our Prism, our IPTV service and we're expanding our Internet profit line across our footprint to better serve our business and wholesale customers. Now the integration of the Embarq continues to proceed well and we continued to make good progress towards completing the pending Qwest transaction.
Now moving to Slide 6 and the debt. Operating revenues were $1.72 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $1.71 billion at the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, were $0.76 per share, $0.01 lower than street consensus according to first call. Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of $342 million in the fourth quarter, excluding $9.1 million of capital investment related to the Embarq integration. Additionally, we achieved approximately $85 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the fourth quarter and ended the year with annual run rate synergies of $340 million.
There were a few factors that contribute to our operating revenues exceeding the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First, we lost fewer access lines that we had forecast for the quarter. Second, our access benefit use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated for the quarter. And finally, we had a couple of prior period true ups that positively impacted revenue. There were also a few expense items that were higher than we had anticipated for the quarter. First, we incurred higher pull rental expenses than anticipated either is seasonal and cost adjustments under certain contracts. And second, we incurred higher contract labor and overtime charges than expected, driven by the expansion of our IPTV service, weather impacts and conversion initiatives.
Demand for our strategic products and services continues to grow and the strategic revenues are increasing as a percentage of total operating revenues. In the fourth quarter 2010 strategic revenues accounted for 31% of revenues compared to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The growth in strategic revenues represent the total operating revenue as a positive trend that we are focused on continuing, in which we expect to realize on revenues from reduced revenues from traditional legacy and access sources. We remain focused on the positioning CenturyLink as a relevant provider of choice in our markets and we continued to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploy higher speeds in key markets, as well adding incremental value through figure and computer support and online backup services.
Also, we continued to enhance and expand our advanced of the data in IP networks and value-added services for our business and enterprise customers.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd Like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we'd added nearly 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as the demand for broadband remains solid and customers have continued to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.4 million as our customers or 42.1% penetration of our broadband enabled access lines and approximately 38.5% penetration of total addressable access lines. We were pleased that we're able to add more than 158,000 high-speed Internet customers during 2010, representing approximately 7.1% year-over-year growth and total high-speed Internet subscribers. In addition, we experienced lower access line losses during the quarter than we had previously anticipated. Our fourth quarter line loss of approximately 123,000 represents a 12% sequential improvement over Q4 2010 and a 15.8% improvement over the fourth quarter 2009 access line loss. We continued to see a decline in outs and disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, are resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports.
We're pleased we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2010, to 7.6% compared to a pro forma 8.8% treading 12 months line loss a year ago. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance of the top five Embarq markets. We continued to see strong tracks in these markets and improvement continued to outpace the rest of the company. We also continued to strengthen our competitive position with partnerships, new product launches and continued execution. This morning, we announced our agreement Verizon wireless to offer a Verizon wireless equipment and service plans to small and residential customers. We're looking forward later this year offering a complete product bundle to improve the leverage to all of our customer base.
Our business for selling DIRECTV are now fully implemented and we're seeing strong results adding nearly 40,000 satellite video subscribers in the fourth quarter. We ended 2010 with almost 628,000 satellite video customers. We also currently offer our CenturyLink Prizm service in five markets across Wisconsin, and Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri. Our newest markets are Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, Naples, Florida. We've exceeded our internal forecast for customer net gains this past year and we are pleased with the progress we're making with our Prism TV service thus far.
The number of Prism capable households past increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter and we continued to expect the past close to 1 million households by the end of this year. We continued to expect to rollout Prism TV service in three additional markets in 2011, bringing CenturyLink's Prism TV to a total of eight markets. In our Enterprise segment, we lost enhanced and our providing and PLS VIP on pricing in a number of key markets. In our Enterprise segment, we expand our NPLS reach by completing wholesale agreement with Qwest and added key value-added capabilities to our ethernet products set. This set provide larger in multiple and PLS sales particularly to a larger delta care and regional banking sectors. Our operating model with global sales and operations depth, now coupled with national data capabilities is enhancing your position in IP data network opportunities.
Now turning to Slide 8. We continued to face a number of challenges during the quarter including very competitive marketplace, the high unemployment and the economy and all of the Embarq integration and pending Qwest merging planning activities we have in process. However, we continued to generate strong cash flows for full year 2010. Our operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was approximately $3.62 billion in 2010. Our full-year total debt and free cash flow was nearly $1.63 billion. Our strong cash flows continues to support the return of cash to shareholders. We paid $220 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter, and $878 million of dividends during the full year of 2010. Our strong cash flows support the continued payment of dividends to shareholders and our 54% payout ratio continues to be one of the lowest in our industry.
Turning to Slide 9. We continued to make great progress towards completing the integration of Embarq. Our fourth market conversion which in the customers in the state of Florida it is scheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion by the end of third quarter of this year. We have completed the migration of the Embarq long-distance customers, representing 400 million minutes of use per month to the CenturyLink IP network, which eliminates, of course, third-party costs for the company. And we continued to see improvement in the urban market operating results and we're consistently meeting our synergy targets, so we're extremely pleased with the Embarq integration.
Now moving to Slide 10. We continued to move steadily ahead with the approval process in the integration planning work for our pending acquisition of Qwest. To date, we received 18 of the 22 regulatory commission approvals required to complete the merger. We continued to work with the remaining four regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission, our remaining approvals. While it is difficult to predict the timing of these remaining regulatory approvals, we currently expect to receive all required regulatory approvals by the end of the first quarter. Therefore, we are currently planning for an April 1, 2011, close and the launch of our combined company. Of course, we do not control the regulatory process and therefore, the close date could be moved out if need to the remaining approvals take longer than we currently anticipate. We continued to make good progress in the organization, design, and planning of the many integration activities required to integrate the two companies, organization design is complete, the employee selection is now underway and we should be substantially complete with those in the next few weeks.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and review of our 2011 guidance. Stewart?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.",1517,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a few significant nonrecurring items that occurred during the fourth quarter, and then I will discuss the fourth quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $27.2 million of pretax expenses or about $0.05 per share related to the integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $7.1 million in pretax transaction, and integration costs are about $0.02 per share related to the pending Qwest acquisition. Third, we had a pretax curtailment gain of $20.9 million or a $0.04 per share associated with freezing our defined benefit pension plan and related to future accruals. Last, we had other net tax benefits that collectively amounted to about $0.01 a share. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.02 per share difference, and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74.
Turning to Slide 13. This slide reflects our results for fourth quarter 2010 compared to fourth quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For fourth quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $118 million to $1.72 billion from $1.84 billion in fourth quarter a year ago. Our cash operating expenses decreased $38 million from $895 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $857 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortize expense increased from $356 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $365 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to depreciation associated with the increased plant and service that more than offset the decline in amortization under the declining balance method for our Embarq intangibles.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $232 million compared to $287 million in fourth quarter 2009. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased to $0.76 from $0.95 in the fourth quarter a year ago. The percentage decline in net income is higher than the percentage decline in operating cash flow due primarily to the smaller denominator.
This year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to the anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you throughout this year, and the challenge of reducing cost in the near term due to the pending Qwest merger and the expansion of IP TV service to additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving a successful integration of the pending Qwest merger are two of our primary focus areas. Additionally, we are incurring startup expenses as we expand offering of our IP TV service to additional markets and as we expand our high-bandwidth service offerings to enterprise customers. While the merger integrations in these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we are confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow increased 2.5% from nearly $334 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $342 million in fourth quarter 2010 due to lower capital expenditures in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to discuss our 2010 results compared to our previous full year 2010 guidance. First, operating revenues declined by 6.5% in 2010 compared to pro forma 2009 operating revenues compared to our previous guidance of an anticipated full year revenue decline of 6.5% to 7%. Second, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow for 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $1.58 billion to $1.62 billion. From a diluted earnings per share standpoint to $3.39 per share we achieved for full year 2010 is that the high-end of our latest guidance of $3.36 to $3.46 per share. Finally, we invested $864 million in capital expenditures in 2010, which is within our prior guidance of $825 million to  to $875 million. The capital that we invested in 2010 included the enablement of high-speed Internet service, IPTV in several markets, expansion of ethernet availability and fiber to the tower. Our 2011 capital investments will continue to focus on these areas which will enable future growth.
Now turning to Slide 20. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending Qwest transaction, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be 4% to 5% lower than 2010 operating revenues, as revenue increases associated with the growth in and Internet are expected to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced Universal Service Funding, access line losses and other items. Additionally, due to anticipated revenue growth associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, the revenue impact of the expected continued improvement in the rate of access line loss and the effects of additional fiber investment, we expect the year-over-year rate of revenue declines, excluding the Qwest transaction and any other nonrecurring items that may occur, to be in the 2% to 4% range by fourth quarter 2011. The company currently expects 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion or 16% higher than 2010 capital expenditures of $864 million, the increase is primarily due to planned incremental fiber to the tower investment.
We expect the Qwest transaction to close on April 1, therefore, we're not providing full year 2011 free cash flow earnings per share guidance. However, we are providing guidance regarding several items that collectively are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share by $0.49 to $0.55.
Items that are anticipated to positively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share are expected synergies associated with the Embarq acquisition in the $0.09 to $0.11 range; increased revenues associated with the expected growth in high-speed Internet customers, $0.10 to $0.14 per share; increased revenues associated with data transport for loss carriers, $0.06 to $0.08 per share; and anticipated lower interest expense in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 per share. The following items are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share. Lower voice-related revenues primarily due to anticipated access line losses of 7% to 7.5%, in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share; lower access revenues primarily driven by access line losses and continued pressure on access minutes of use, $0.18 to $0.22 per share; start up losses associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, $0.12 to $0.14 a share; reduced interstate Universal Service Funding $0.05 to $0.06 per share; and expected migration of network traffic from wireless carrier customer, $0.05 to $0.07 per share.
For the first quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.70. The decline in first quarter diluted earnings per share compared to fourth quarter is primarily due to continued decline in access lines, access minutes, the normal annual adjustment to USF revenue, increased payroll taxes and the continued expansion of IPTV.
Now turning to Slide 16. Finally, as we outlined in our press release this morning, there are several items that I want to briefly discuss regarding the accounting rules for business combinations that you would want to consider when building a financial model for the combination of CenturyLink and Qwest. None of these items will impact cash flow.
First, purchase accounting rules require that the debt of Qwest be adjusted to fair value at the time of the merger closed. Based on Qwest's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2010, the impact of this fair value adjustment would have decreased interest expense for pro forma full-year 2011 by approximately $287 million compared to the expected levels absent the fair value adjustment.
Second, deferred revenues and related deferred costs from Qwest's balance sheet must be assigned a fair value. We currently anticipate the fair value of the deferred revenues and related costs to be assigned minimal to no value. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that pro forma 2011 revenues would have been negatively impacted by approximately $140 million and that pro forma 2011 operating expenses would be reduced by approximately $100 million.
Third, the tangible and intangible assets of Qwest must be reflected on the books of the combined company at their fair value. The fair value assignment may significantly impact depreciation and amortization of the customer base. However, the impact cannot be determined at this time. Finally, the merger will result in the elimination of approximately $70 million of annual revenues and corresponding expenses related to arms length business relationships between CenturyLink and Qwest today that will become intercompany transactions and subject to elimination following the merger close.
So this concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

We additionally in terms of long distance declines in revenue, as well as network access and just basic voice revenue, is about $15 million or so from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So that makes up the majority of the declines on which that from the fourth to first. And then 2011 versus '10, the EPS items in terms of how much is a continuation, basically, the items that impact the decline in revenues related to access line declines and minutes of use basically are items that do just continue from 2010 to 2011. I mean, we'll continue to see declines in those items. They are new declines, they're not just variables basically. So there's really not very much in terms of carryover. There are a few items in terms of the wireless carrier that's migrating traffic, also the Embarq network, as well as some database lookup revenue that Embarq had, and that's probably in the neighborhood combined about $15 million or so, $15 million to $20 million."

As for timing, we expect to begin selling the service in the next few months. In the next couple of months, we should roll it out and of course expanding that for the rest of the year. Regarding the proposed NPRM, the FCC released last week really as the national broadband plan. It presents some opportunities and risks for CenturyLink and our real customers of course. We need room in the NPRM it's just the starting point. It's not an order, so there's much work to be done within the industry to build overall consensus around reform, obviously, the details and the matters of agency off really implements and reform will be critical. We continue to support our approach and includes a reasonable transition period, minimum customer rate increases and no unintended mandates. And we believe there are really a combined company with Qwest will be well-positioned to manage any of the performance that may eventually be enacted.
As you know, the NPRM propose to reduce access charges over time. But it also propose a stabilized the transition by harmonizing rates, reducing overcharge, minimizing disputes. It also proposes to create an offsetting revenue opportunity, provide access to UFS support where it's needed from data high speed data so we expect a pretty consistent process here, and although we certainly starting, as well as we could expect at this point."

Now first, we reported solid results for the four",1641,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discussed CenturyLink's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Operating Results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. Now first, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter, for full year 2010. We achieved operating revenues in the fourth quarter that exceeded the top end of our guidance, and diluted earnings per share near the top end of our guidance, operating revenues for full year 2010 were $7.04 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 41.6%, primarily driven by the mid-2009 acquisition of Embarq along with the continued growth and strategic revenues. 
Second, we achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber additions during the fourth quarter and full year 2010 resulting in an annual subscriber growth rate of more than 7%. Additionally, we improved our absolute access line to climb of more than 20% full year 2010 compared to pro forma full-year of 2009. 
We also continued the expansion of our Prism, our IPTV service and we're expanding our Internet profit line service across our footprint to better serve our business and wholesale customers. Now the integration of the Embarq continues to proceed well and we continued to make good progress towards completing the pending Qwest transaction.
Now moving to Slide 6 and the debt. Operating revenues were $1.72 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $1.71 billion at the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, were $0.76 per share, a $0.01 lower than Street consensus according to first call. 
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of $342 million in the fourth quarter, excluding $9.1 million of capital investment related to the Embarq integration. Additionally, we achieved approximately $85 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the fourth quarter and ended the year with annual run rate synergies of $340 million.
There were a few factors that contributed to our operating revenues exceeding the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First, we lost fewer access lines that we had forecast for the quarter. Second, our access benefit use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated for the quarter. And finally, we had a couple of prior period true ups that positively impacted revenue. There were also a few expense items that were higher than we had anticipated for the quarter. First, we incurred higher pull rental expenses than anticipated either it's seasonal and cost adjustments under certain contracts. And second, we incurred higher contract labor and overtime charges than expected, driven by the expansion of our IPTV service, weather impacts and conversion initiatives.
Demand for our strategic products and services continues to grow and the strategic revenues are increasing as a percentage of total operating revenues. In the fourth quarter 2010 strategic revenues accounted for 31% of revenues compared to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The growth in strategic revenues represent the total operating revenue as a positive trend that we are focused on continuing, in which we expect to realize on revenues from reduced reliance on revenues from traditional legacy and access sources. We remained focused on the positioning of CenturyLink as a relevant provider of choice in our markets and we continued to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploy higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband figures and just computer support and online backup services.
Also, we continued to enhance and expand our advanced data in IP networks and value-added services for our business and enterprise customers.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we'd added nearly 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as the demand for broadband remains solid and customers have continued to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.4 million access for our customers or 42.1% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 38.5% penetration of total addressable access lines. 
We were pleased that we're able to add more than 158,000 high-speed Internet customers during 2010, representing approximately 7.1% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers. In addition, we experienced lower access line losses during the quarter than we had previously anticipated. Our fourth quarter line loss of approximately 123,000 represents a 12% sequential improvement over third quarter 2010 and a 15.8% improvement over the fourth quarter 2009 access line loss. We continued to see a decline in outs and disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, are resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports.
We're pleased we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2010, to 7.6% compared to a pro forma 8.8% trailing 12 months line loss a year ago. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance of the top five Embarq markets. We continue to see strong tracks in these markets and improvement then continued to outpace the rest of the company. 
We also continued to strengthen our competitive position with partnerships, new product launches and continued execution. This morning, we announced our agreement with Verizon wireless to offer a Verizon wireless equipment and service plans to our residential and small business customers. We're looking forward later this year offering a complete product bundle to our -- including wireless to all of our customer base.
Our processes for selling DIRECTV are now fully implemented and we're seeing strong results adding nearly 40,000 satellite video subscribers in the fourth quarter. We ended 2010 with almost 628,000 satellite video customers. We also currently offer our CenturyLink Prism service in five markets across Wisconsin, and Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri. Our newest markets of Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, Naples, Florida. We've exceeded our internal forecast for customer net gains this past year and we are pleased with the progress we're making with our Prism TV service thus far.
The number of Prism capable households past increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter and we continued to expect the past close to 1 million households by the end of this year. We continued to expect to rollout Prism TV service in three additional markets in 2011, bringing CenturyLink's Prism TV to a total of eight markets. 
In our Enterprise segment, we lost enhanced season net and are providing MPLS VI and PRI it's own pricing in a number of key markets. In our Enterprise segment, we expanded our NPLS reach by completing a wholesale agreement with Qwest and added key value-added capabilities to our ethernet products set. This set provide up to two different larger in multi-site MPLS sales particularly to a larger delta care and regional banking sectors. Our operating model with global sales and operations depth, now coupled with national data capabilities is enhancing our position in IP data network opportunities.
Now turning to Slide 8. We continued to face a number of challenges during the quarter including a very competitive marketplace, the high unemployment economy and all of the Embarq integration and pending Qwest merger planning activities we have in process. However, we continued to generate strong cash flows for full year 2010. Our operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was approximately $3.62 billion in 2010. Our full-year 2010 free cash flow was nearly $1.63 billion. 
Our strong cash flows continues to support the return of cash to shareholders. We paid $220 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter, $878 million of dividends during the full year of 2010. Our strong cash flows support the continued payment of dividends to shareholders and our 54% payout ratio continues to be one of the lowest in our industry.
Turning to Slide 9. We continued to make great progress towards completing the integration of Embarq. Our fourth market conversion which is beyond our customers in the state of Florida. It is scheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion by the end of third quarter of this year. 
We have completed the migration of Embarq long-distance customers, representing 400 million minutes of use per month to the CenturyLink IP network, which eliminates, of course, third-party carry-on costs for the company. And we continued to see improvement in the urban market operating results and we're consistently meeting our synergy targets, so we're extremely pleased with the Embarq integration.
Now moving to Slide 10. We continued to move steadily ahead with the approval process in the integration planning work for our pending acquisition of Qwest. To date, we received 18 of the 22 regulatory commission approvals required to complete the merger. We continued to work with the remaining four regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission, on the remaining approvals. While it is difficult to predict the timing of these remaining regulatory approvals, we currently expect to receive all required regulatory approvals by the end of the first quarter. 
Therefore, we are currently planning for an April 1, 2011, close and the launch of our combined company. Of course, we do not control the regulatory process and therefore, the close date could be moved out if the remaining approvals take longer than we currently anticipate. We continued to make good progress in the organization design and planning of the many integration activities required to integrate the two companies, organization design is complete, the employee selection is now underway and we should be substantially complete with those in the next few weeks.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and review of our 2011 guidance. Stewart?"
260149,126907206,103199,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.",1519,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a few significant nonrecurring items that occurred during the fourth quarter, and then I will discuss the fourth quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $27.2 million of pretax expenses or about $0.05 per share related to the integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $7.1 million in pretax transaction, and integration costs are about $0.02 per share related to the pending Qwest acquisition. Third, we had a pretax curtailment gain of $20.9 million or a $0.04 per share associated with freezing our defined benefit pension plan and related to future accruals. Last, we had other net tax benefits that collectively amounted to about $0.01 a share. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.02 per share difference, and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74.
Turning to Slide 13. This slide reflects our results for fourth quarter 2010 compared to fourth quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For fourth quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $118 million to $1.72 billion from $1.84 billion in fourth quarter a year ago. Our cash operating expenses decreased $38 million from $895 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $857 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $356 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $365 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to depreciation associated with the increased plant and service that more than offset the decline in amortization under the declining balance method for our Embarq intangibles.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $232 million compared to $287 million in fourth quarter 2009. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased to $0.76 from $0.95 in the fourth quarter a year ago. The percentage decline in net income is higher than the percentage decline in operating cash flow due primarily to the smaller denominator.
This year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to the anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you throughout this year, and the challenge of reducing cost in the near term due to the pending Qwest merger and the expansion of IP TV service to additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving a successful integration of the pending Qwest merger are two of our primary focus areas. 
Additionally, we are incurring start-up expenses as we expand the offering of our IP TV service to additional markets and as we expand our high-bandwidth service offerings to enterprise customers. While the merger integrations in these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we are confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow increased 2.5% from nearly $334 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $342 million in fourth quarter 2010 due to lower capital expenditures in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to discuss our 2010 results compared to our previous full year 2010 guidance. First, operating revenues declined by 6.5% in 2010 compared to pro forma 2009 operating revenues compared to our previous guidance of an anticipated full year revenue decline of 6.5% to 7%. Second, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow for 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $1.58 billion to $1.62 billion. 
From a diluted earnings per share standpoint to $3.39 per share we achieved for full year 2010 is that the high-end of our latest guidance of $3.36 to $3.46 per share. Finally, we invested $864 million in capital expenditures in 2010, which is within our prior guidance of $825 million to $875 million. The capital that we invested in 2010 included the enablement of high-speed Internet service, IPTV in several markets, expansion of ethernet availability and fiber to the tower. Our 2011 capital investments will continue to focus on these areas which will enable future growth.
Now turning to Slide 20. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending Qwest transaction, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. 
For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be 4% to 5% lower than 2010 operating revenues, as revenue increases associated with the growth in high speed Internet are expected to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced Universal Service Funding, access line losses and other items. Additionally, due to anticipated revenue growth associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, the revenue impact of the expected continued improvement in the rate of access line loss and the effects of additional fiber investment, we expect the year-over-year rate of revenue declines, excluding the Qwest transaction and any other nonrecurring items that may occur, to be in the 2% to 4% range by fourth quarter 2011. The company currently expects 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion or 16% higher than 2010 capital expenditures of $864 million, the increase is primarily due to planned incremental fiber to the tower investment.
We expect the Qwest transaction to close on April 1, therefore, we're not providing full year 2011 free cash flow earnings per share guidance. However, we are providing guidance regarding several items that collectively are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share by $0.49 to $0.55.
Items that are anticipated to positively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share are expected synergies associated with the Embarq acquisition in the $0.09 to $0.11 range; increased revenues associated with the expected growth in high-speed Internet customers, $0.10 to $0.14 per share; increased revenues associated with data transport for loss carriers, $0.06 to $0.08 per share; and anticipated lower interest expense in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 per share. The following items are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share. Lower voice-related revenues primarily due to anticipated access line losses of 7% to 7.5%, in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share; lower access revenues primarily driven by access line losses and continued pressure on access minutes of use, $0.18 to $0.22 per share; start up losses associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, $0.12 to $0.14 a share; reduced interstate Universal Service Funding, $0.05 to $0.06 per share; and expected migration of network traffic from a wireless carrier customer, $0.05 to $0.07 per share.
For the first quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.70. The decline in first quarter diluted earnings per share compared to fourth quarter is primarily due to continued decline in access lines, access minutes, the normal annual adjustment to USF revenue, increased payroll taxes and the continued expansion of IPTV.
Now turning to Slide 16. Finally, as we outlined in our press release this morning, there are several items that I want to briefly discuss regarding the accounting rules for business combinations that you would want to consider when building a financial model for the combination of CenturyLink and Qwest. None of these items will impact the cash flow.
First, purchase accounting rules require that the debt of Qwest be adjusted to fair value at the time that the merger closed. Based on Qwest's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2010, the impact of this fair value adjustment would have decreased interest expense for pro forma full-year 2011 by approximately $287 million compared to the expected levels absent the fair value adjustment.
Second, deferred revenues and related deferred costs from Qwest's balance sheet must be assigned a fair value. We currently anticipate the fair value of the deferred revenues and related costs to be assigned minimal to no value. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that pro forma 2011 revenues would have been negatively impacted by approximately $140 million and that pro forma 2011 operating expenses would be reduced by approximately $100 million.
Third, the tangible and intangible assets of Qwest must be reflected on the books of the combined company at their fair value. The fair value assignment may significantly impact depreciation and amortization of the customer base. However, the impact cannot be determined at this time. 
Finally, the merger will result in the elimination of approximately $70 million of annual revenues and corresponding expenses related to arms length business relationships between CenturyLink and Qwest today that will become intercompany transactions and subject to elimination following the merger close.
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

We additionally, in terms of long distance declines in revenue, as well as network access and just basic voice revenue, is about $15 million or so from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So that makes up the majority of the declines on which the -- from the fourth to first. And then in 2011 versus '10, the EPS items in terms of how much is a continuation, basically, the items that impact the decline in revenues related to access line declines and minutes of use were basically are items that do just continue from 2010 to 2011. I mean, we'll continue to see declines in those items. They are new declines, they're not just variables basically. So there's really not very much in terms of carryover. There are a few items in terms of the wireless carrier that's migrating traffic out of the Embarq network, as well as some database lookup revenue that Embarq had, and that's probably in the neighborhood combined of about $15 million or so, $15 million to $20 million."

But other than that, there are not a lot of costs other than just training costs for employee base where we have a cost that was incurred there. As far as timing, we expect to begin selling the service in the next few months. In the next couple of months, we should roll it out and of course expanding that over for the rest of the year. Regarding the proposed NPRM, the FCC released last week really a poll of the national broadband plan. It prevents longevity and  risks for CenturyLink and our real customers of course. We need room in the NPRM it's just the starting point. It's not an order, so there's much work to be done within the industry to build overall consensus around reform, obviously, the details and the matters of which the off-knowing really implements and reform will be critical. We continue to support our approach and includes a reasonable transition period, minimum customer rate increases and no unfunded mandates. And we believe there are really a combined company with Qwest will be well-positioned to manage any of the performance that may eventually be enacted.
As you know, the NPRM propose to reduce access charges over time. But it also propose a stabilized of disease transition by harmonizing rates, reducing arbitrage, minimizing disputes. It also proposes to create an offsetting revenue opportunity, provide access to UFS support where it's needed from data high speed data. So we expect a pretty consistent process here, and although we certainly as it always we kind of as well as we could expect at this point."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discussed CenturyLink's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Operating Results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. Now first, we reported solid results for the four",1641,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discussed CenturyLink's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Operating Results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. Now first, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter, for full year 2010. We achieved operating revenues in the fourth quarter that exceeded the top end of our guidance, and diluted earnings per share near the top end of our guidance, operating revenues for full year 2010 were $7.04 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 41.6%, primarily driven by the mid-2009 acquisition of Embarq along with the continued growth and strategic revenues. 
Second, we achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber additions during the fourth quarter and full year 2010 resulting in an annual subscriber growth rate of more than 7%. Additionally, we improved our absolute access line to climb of more than 20% full year 2010 compared to pro forma full-year of 2009. 
We also continued the expansion of our Prism, our IPTV service and we're expanding our Internet profit line service across our footprint to better serve our business and wholesale customers. Now the integration of the Embarq continues to proceed well and we continued to make good progress towards completing the pending Qwest transaction.
Now moving to Slide 6 and the debt. Operating revenues were $1.72 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $1.71 billion at the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, were $0.76 per share, a $0.01 lower than Street consensus according to first call. 
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of $342 million in the fourth quarter, excluding $9.1 million of capital investment related to the Embarq integration. Additionally, we achieved approximately $85 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the fourth quarter and ended the year with annual run rate synergies of $340 million.
There were a few factors that contributed to our operating revenues exceeding the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First, we lost fewer access lines that we had forecast for the quarter. Second, our access benefit use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated for the quarter. And finally, we had a couple of prior period true ups that positively impacted revenue. There were also a few expense items that were higher than we had anticipated for the quarter. First, we incurred higher pull rental expenses than anticipated either it's seasonal and cost adjustments under certain contracts. And second, we incurred higher contract labor and overtime charges than expected, driven by the expansion of our IPTV service, weather impacts and conversion initiatives.
Demand for our strategic products and services continues to grow and the strategic revenues are increasing as a percentage of total operating revenues. In the fourth quarter 2010 strategic revenues accounted for 31% of revenues compared to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The growth in strategic revenues represent the total operating revenue as a positive trend that we are focused on continuing, in which we expect to realize on revenues from reduced reliance on revenues from traditional legacy and access sources. We remained focused on the positioning of CenturyLink as a relevant provider of choice in our markets and we continued to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploy higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband figures and just computer support and online backup services.
Also, we continued to enhance and expand our advanced data in IP networks and value-added services for our business and enterprise customers.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we'd added nearly 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as the demand for broadband remains solid and customers have continued to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.4 million access for our customers or 42.1% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 38.5% penetration of total addressable access lines. 
We were pleased that we're able to add more than 158,000 high-speed Internet customers during 2010, representing approximately 7.1% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers. In addition, we experienced lower access line losses during the quarter than we had previously anticipated. Our fourth quarter line loss of approximately 123,000 represents a 12% sequential improvement over third quarter 2010 and a 15.8% improvement over the fourth quarter 2009 access line loss. We continued to see a decline in outs and disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, are resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports.
We're pleased we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2010, to 7.6% compared to a pro forma 8.8% trailing 12 months line loss a year ago. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance of the top five Embarq markets. We continue to see strong tracks in these markets and improvement then continued to outpace the rest of the company. 
We also continued to strengthen our competitive position with partnerships, new product launches and continued execution. This morning, we announced our agreement with Verizon wireless to offer a Verizon wireless equipment and service plans to our residential and small business customers. We're looking forward later this year offering a complete product bundle to our -- including wireless to all of our customer base.
Our processes for selling DIRECTV are now fully implemented and we're seeing strong results adding nearly 40,000 satellite video subscribers in the fourth quarter. We ended 2010 with almost 628,000 satellite video customers. We also currently offer our CenturyLink Prism service in five markets across Wisconsin, and Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri. Our newest markets of Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, Naples, Florida. We've exceeded our internal forecast for customer net gains this past year and we are pleased with the progress we're making with our Prism TV service thus far.
The number of Prism capable households past increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter and we continued to expect the past close to 1 million households by the end of this year. We continued to expect to rollout Prism TV service in three additional markets in 2011, bringing CenturyLink's Prism TV to a total of eight markets. 
In our Enterprise segment, we lost enhanced season net and are providing MPLS VI and PRI it's own pricing in a number of key markets. In our Enterprise segment, we expanded our NPLS reach by completing a wholesale agreement with Qwest and added key value-added capabilities to our ethernet products set. This set provide up to two different larger in multi-site MPLS sales particularly to a larger delta care and regional banking sectors. Our operating model with global sales and operations depth, now coupled with national data capabilities is enhancing our position in IP data network opportunities.
Now turning to Slide 8. We continued to face a number of challenges during the quarter including a very competitive marketplace, the high unemployment economy and all of the Embarq integration and pending Qwest merger planning activities we have in process. However, we continued to generate strong cash flows for full year 2010. Our operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was approximately $3.62 billion in 2010. Our full-year 2010 free cash flow was nearly $1.63 billion. 
Our strong cash flows continues to support the return of cash to shareholders. We paid $220 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter, $878 million of dividends during the full year of 2010. Our strong cash flows support the continued payment of dividends to shareholders and our 54% payout ratio continues to be one of the lowest in our industry.
Turning to Slide 9. We continued to make great progress towards completing the integration of Embarq. Our fourth market conversion which is beyond our customers in the state of Florida. It is scheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion by the end of third quarter of this year. 
We have completed the migration of Embarq long-distance customers, representing 400 million minutes of use per month to the CenturyLink IP network, which eliminates, of course, third-party carry-on costs for the company. And we continued to see improvement in the urban market operating results and we're consistently meeting our synergy targets, so we're extremely pleased with the Embarq integration.
Now moving to Slide 10. We continued to move steadily ahead with the approval process in the integration planning work for our pending acquisition of Qwest. To date, we received 18 of the 22 regulatory commission approvals required to complete the merger. We continued to work with the remaining four regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission, on the remaining approvals. While it is difficult to predict the timing of these remaining regulatory approvals, we currently expect to receive all required regulatory approvals by the end of the first quarter. 
Therefore, we are currently planning for an April 1, 2011, close and the launch of our combined company. Of course, we do not control the regulatory process and therefore, the close date could be moved out if the remaining approvals take longer than we currently anticipate. We continued to make good progress in the organization design and planning of the many integration activities required to integrate the two companies, organization design is complete, the employee selection is now underway and we should be substantially complete with those in the next few weeks.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and review of our 2011 guidance. Stewart?"
260149,126907206,103201,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.",1519,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with the discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a few significant nonrecurring items that occurred during the fourth quarter, and then I will discuss the fourth quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $27.2 million of pretax expenses or about $0.05 per share related to the integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $7.1 million in pretax transaction, and integration costs are about $0.02 per share related to the pending Qwest acquisition. Third, we had a pretax curtailment gain of $20.9 million or a $0.04 per share associated with freezing our defined benefit pension plan and related to future accruals. Last, we had other net tax benefits that collectively amounted to about $0.01 a share. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.02 per share difference, and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74.
Turning to Slide 13. This slide reflects our results for fourth quarter 2010 compared to fourth quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For fourth quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $118 million to $1.72 billion from $1.84 billion in fourth quarter a year ago. Our cash operating expenses decreased $38 million from $895 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $857 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $356 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $365 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to depreciation associated with the increased plant and service that more than offset the decline in amortization under the declining balance method for our Embarq intangibles.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $232 million compared to $287 million in fourth quarter 2009. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased to $0.76 from $0.95 in the fourth quarter a year ago. The percentage decline in net income is higher than the percentage decline in operating cash flow due primarily to the smaller denominator.
This year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to the anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you throughout this year, and the challenge of reducing cost in the near term due to the pending Qwest merger and the expansion of IP TV service to additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving a successful integration of the pending Qwest merger are two of our primary focus areas. 
Additionally, we are incurring start-up expenses as we expand the offering of our IP TV service to additional markets and as we expand our high-bandwidth service offerings to enterprise customers. While the merger integrations in these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we are confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow increased 2.5% from nearly $334 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $342 million in fourth quarter 2010 due to lower capital expenditures in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to discuss our 2010 results compared to our previous full year 2010 guidance. First, operating revenues declined by 6.5% in 2010 compared to pro forma 2009 operating revenues compared to our previous guidance of an anticipated full year revenue decline of 6.5% to 7%. Second, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow for 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $1.58 billion to $1.62 billion. 
From a diluted earnings per share standpoint to $3.39 per share we achieved for full year 2010 is that the high-end of our latest guidance of $3.36 to $3.46 per share. Finally, we invested $864 million in capital expenditures in 2010, which is within our prior guidance of $825 million to $875 million. The capital that we invested in 2010 included the enablement of high-speed Internet service, IPTV in several markets, expansion of ethernet availability and fiber to the tower. Our 2011 capital investments will continue to focus on these areas which will enable future growth.
Now turning to Slide 20. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending Qwest transaction, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. 
For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be 4% to 5% lower than 2010 operating revenues, as revenue increases associated with the growth in high speed Internet are expected to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced Universal Service Funding, access line losses and other items. Additionally, due to anticipated revenue growth associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, the revenue impact of the expected continued improvement in the rate of access line loss and the effects of additional fiber investment, we expect the year-over-year rate of revenue declines, excluding the Qwest transaction and any other nonrecurring items that may occur, to be in the 2% to 4% range by fourth quarter 2011. The company currently expects 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion or 16% higher than 2010 capital expenditures of $864 million, the increase is primarily due to planned incremental fiber to the tower investment.
We expect the Qwest transaction to close on April 1, therefore, we're not providing full year 2011 free cash flow earnings per share guidance. However, we are providing guidance regarding several items that collectively are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share by $0.49 to $0.55.
Items that are anticipated to positively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share are expected synergies associated with the Embarq acquisition in the $0.09 to $0.11 range; increased revenues associated with the expected growth in high-speed Internet customers, $0.10 to $0.14 per share; increased revenues associated with data transport for loss carriers, $0.06 to $0.08 per share; and anticipated lower interest expense in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 per share. The following items are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share. Lower voice-related revenues primarily due to anticipated access line losses of 7% to 7.5%, in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share; lower access revenues primarily driven by access line losses and continued pressure on access minutes of use, $0.18 to $0.22 per share; start up losses associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, $0.12 to $0.14 a share; reduced interstate Universal Service Funding, $0.05 to $0.06 per share; and expected migration of network traffic from a wireless carrier customer, $0.05 to $0.07 per share.
For the first quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.70. The decline in first quarter diluted earnings per share compared to fourth quarter is primarily due to continued decline in access lines, access minutes, the normal annual adjustment to USF revenue, increased payroll taxes and the continued expansion of IPTV.
Now turning to Slide 16. Finally, as we outlined in our press release this morning, there are several items that I want to briefly discuss regarding the accounting rules for business combinations that you would want to consider when building a financial model for the combination of CenturyLink and Qwest. None of these items will impact the cash flow.
First, purchase accounting rules require that the debt of Qwest be adjusted to fair value at the time that the merger closed. Based on Qwest's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2010, the impact of this fair value adjustment would have decreased interest expense for pro forma full-year 2011 by approximately $287 million compared to the expected levels absent the fair value adjustment.
Second, deferred revenues and related deferred costs from Qwest's balance sheet must be assigned a fair value. We currently anticipate the fair value of the deferred revenues and related costs to be assigned minimal to no value. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that pro forma 2011 revenues would have been negatively impacted by approximately $140 million and that pro forma 2011 operating expenses would be reduced by approximately $100 million.
Third, the tangible and intangible assets of Qwest must be reflected on the books of the combined company at their fair value. The fair value assignment may significantly impact depreciation and amortization of the customer base. However, the impact cannot be determined at this time. 
Finally, the merger will result in the elimination of approximately $70 million of annual revenues and corresponding expenses related to arms length business relationships between CenturyLink and Qwest today that will become intercompany transactions and subject to elimination following the merger close.
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

Can you just quantify how much that impacted for 4Q SG&A and I believe that's where it'd be allocated.

So I was just hoping you would be able to walk through the items that will cause that change in revenue trajectory through 2011. And then final question, you outlined a number of items that will impact 2011 EPS versus 2010.

We additionally, in terms of long distance declines in revenue, as well as network access and just basic voice revenue, is about $15 million or so from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So that makes up the majority of the declines on which the -- from the fourth to first. And then in 2011 versus '10, the EPS items in terms of how much is a continuation, basically, the items that impact the decline in revenues related to access line declines and minutes of use were basically are items that do just continue from 2010 to 2011. I mean, we'll continue to see declines in those items. They are new declines, they're not just variables basically. So there's really not very much in terms of carryover. There are a few items in terms of the wireless carrier that's migrating traffic out of the Embarq network, as well as some database lookup revenue that Embarq had, and that's probably in the neighborhood combined of about $15 million or so, $15 million to $20 million."

But other than that, there are not a lot of costs other than just training costs for employee base where we have a cost that was incurred there. As far as timing, we expect to begin selling the service in the next few months. In the next couple of months, we should roll it out and of course expanding that over for the rest of the year. Regarding the proposed NPRM, the FCC released last week really a poll of the national broadband plan. It prevents longevity and  risks for CenturyLink and our real customers of course. We need room in the NPRM it's just the starting point. It's not an order, so there's much work to be done within the industry to build overall consensus around reform, obviously, the details and the matters of which the off-knowing really implements and reform will be critical. We continue to support our approach and includes a reasonable transition period, minimum customer rate increases and no unfunded mandates. And we believe there are really a combined company with Qwest will be well-positioned to manage any of the performance that may eventually be enacted.
As you know, the NPRM propose to reduce access charges over time. But it also propose a stabilized of disease transition by harmonizing rates, reducing arbitrage, minimizing disputes. It also proposes to create an offsetting revenue opportunity, provide access to UFS support where it's needed from data high speed data.

First, we reported solid results for the fourth q",1623,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. 
First, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and for full year 2010. We achieved operating revenues in the fourth quarter that exceeded the top end of our guidance, and diluted earnings per share near the top end of our guidance. Operating revenues for full year 2010 were $7.04 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 41.6%, primarily driven by the mid-2009 acquisition of Embarq along with the continued growth and strategic revenues. 
Second, we achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber additions during the fourth quarter and full year 2010 resulting in an annual subscriber growth rate of more than 7%. Additionally, we improved our absolute access line decline by more than 20% for full year 2010 compared to pro forma full year of 2009. 
We also continued the expansion of our Prism, our IPTV service, and we're expanding our Ethernet Private Line Service across our footprint to better serve our business and wholesale customers. Now the integration of Embarq continues to proceed well and we continue to make good progress towards completing the pending Qwest transaction.
Now moving to Slide 6 in the deck. Operating revenues were $1.72 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $1.71 billion top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding non-recurring items, were $0.76 per share, $0.01 lower than Street consensus according to FirstCall. 
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of $342 million in the fourth quarter, excluding $9.1 million of capital investment related to the Embarq integration. Additionally, we achieved approximately $85 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the fourth quarter, ending the year with annual run rate synergies of $340 million.
There were a few factors that contributed to our operating revenues exceeding the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First, we lost fewer access lines that we had forecast for the quarter. Second, our access benefit use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated for the quarter. And finally, we had a couple of prior-period true-ups that positively impacted revenue. There were also a few expense items that were higher than we had anticipated for the quarter. First, we incurred higher pull rental expenses than anticipated due to seasonal cost adjustments under certain contracts. And second, we incurred higher contract labor and overtime charges than expected, driven by the expansion of our IPTV service, weather impacts and conversion initiatives.
Demand for our strategic products and services continues to grow and strategic revenues are increasing as a percentage of total operating revenues. In fourth quarter 2010, strategic revenues accounted for 31% of revenues compared to 28% in fourth quarter 2009.
The growth in strategic revenue as a percentage of total operating revenue is a positive trend that we are focused on continuing, and which we expect reliance on revenues from traditional -- reduced reliance on revenues from traditional legacy voice and access sources. We remain focused on positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets, and we continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio through deploy higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband features, such as computer support and online backup services.
Also, we continue to enhance and expand our advanced data in IP networks and value-added services for our business and enterprise customers.
Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we've added nearly 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers were continuing to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.4 million access lines customers or 42.1% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 38.5% penetration of total addressable access lines. We were pleased that we were able to add more than 158,000 high-speed Internet customers during 2010, representing approximately 7.1% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers. 
In addition, we experienced lower access line losses during the quarter than we had previously anticipated. Our fourth quarter line loss of approximately 123,000 represents a 12% sequential improvement over the third quarter 2010 and a 15.8% improvement over fourth quarter 2009 access line loss. 
We continued to see a decline in outs and disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports.
We're pleased we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2010, to 7.6% compared to a pro forma 8.8% trailing 12 months line loss a year ago. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance of the top five Embarq markets. We continue to see strong tracks in these markets and improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company. 
We also continued to strengthen our competitive position with partnerships, new product launches and continued execution. This morning, we announced our agreement with Verizon Wireless to offer Verizon Wireless equipment and service plans to our residential and small business customers. We're looking forward to, later this year, offering a complete product bundle including wireless to all of our customer base.
Our processes for selling DIRECTV are now fully implemented, and we're seeing strong results, adding nearly 40,000 satellite video subscribers in the fourth quarter. We ended 2010 with almost 628,000 satellite video customers. We also currently offer our CenturyLink Prism service in five markets across La Crosse, Wisconsin, Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and our newest markets of Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, Naples, Florida. We've exceeded our internal forecast for customer net gains this past year, and we’re pleased with the progress we are making with our Prism TV service thus far.
The number of Prism capable households passed increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter and we continue to expect the pass close to 1 million households by the end of this year. We continue to expect to roll out Prism TV service in three additional markets in 2011, bringing CenturyLink's Prism TV to a total of eight markets. 
In our Enterprise segment, we lost Enhanced Ethernet and are providing MPLS DIE [ph] and PRI [ph], zone pricing in a number of key markets. In our Enterprise segment, we expanded our MPLS reach by completing a wholesale agreement with Qwest and added key value-added capabilities to our Ethernet product set. Now this set will provide opportunity for larger multi-site MPLS sales, particularly to larger government, healthcare and regional banking sectors. Our operating model with local sales and operations depth, now coupled with national data capabilities, is enhancing our position in IP data network opportunities.
Now turning to Slide 8. We continued to face a number of challenges during the quarter including a very competitive marketplace, a high unemployment economy and all of the Embarq integration and pending Qwest merger planning activities we have in process. However, we continued to generate strong cash flows for full year 2010. Our operating cash flow, excluding non-recurring items, was approximately $3.62 billion in 2010. Full year 2010 free cash flow was nearly $1.63 billion. 
Our strong cash flows continue to support the return of cash to shareholders. We’ve paid $220 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter, $878 million in dividends during the full year of 2010. Our strong cash flows support the continued payment of dividends to shareholders and our 54% payout ratio continues to be one of the lowest in our industry.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to make great progress toward completing the integration of Embarq. Our fourth market conversion, which will be all our customers in the State of Florida, is scheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion by the end of third quarter of this year. 
We have completed the migration of Embarq long-distance customers, representing 400 million minutes of use per month to the CenturyLink IP network, which eliminates, of course, third-party carrier cost for the company. And we continue to see improvement in urban market operating results and we're consistently meeting our synergy targets, so we're extremely pleased with the Embarq integration.
Now moving to Slide 10. We continue to move steadily ahead with the approval process and integration planning work for our pending acquisition of Qwest. To date, we have received 18 of 22 regulatory commission approvals required to complete the merger. We continue to work with the remaining four regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission on the remaining approvals. While it is difficult to predict the timing of these remaining regulatory approvals, we currently expect to receive all required regulatory approvals by the end of the first quarter. Therefore, we are currently planning for an April 1, 2011, close and the launch of our combined company. Of course, we do not control the regulatory process and therefore, the close date could be moved out if the remaining approvals take longer than we currently anticipate. 
We continue to make good progress in the organization design and planning of the many integration activities required to integrate the two companies, organization design is complete. Employee selection is now underway and we should be substantially complete with those in the next few weeks.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and review of our 2011 guidance. Stewart?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.Tu",1514,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2010 operating results and I will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a few significant non-recurring items that occurred during the fourth quarter, and then I will discuss the fourth quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $27.2 million of pretax expenses or about $0.05 per share related to the integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $7.1 million in pretax transaction and integration costs or about $0.02 per share related to the pending Qwest acquisition. Third, we had a pretax curtailment gain of $20.9 million or $0.04 per share associated with freezing our defined benefit pension plan and related to future accruals. Last, we had other net tax benefits that collectively amounted to about $0.01 a share. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.02 per share difference and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74.
Turning to Slide 13. This slide reflects our results for fourth quarter 2010 compared to fourth quarter 2009, excluding non-recurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For fourth quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $118 million to $1.72 billion from $1.84 billion in fourth quarter a year ago. Our cash operating expenses decreased $38 million from $895 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $857 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $356 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $365 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to depreciation associated with increased plant and service that more than offset the decline in amortization under the declining balance method for our Embarq intangibles.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $232 million compared to $287 million in fourth quarter 2009. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased to $0.76 from $0.95 in the fourth quarter a year ago. The percentage decline in net income is higher than the percentage decline in operating cash flow due primarily to the smaller denominator.
This year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to the anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you throughout this year and the challenge of reducing cost in the near term due to the pending Qwest merger and the expansion of IPTV service to additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving a successful integration of the pending Qwest merger are two of our primary focus areas. 
Additionally, we are incurring startup expenses as we expand the offering of our IPTV service to additional markets and as we expand our high-bandwidth service offerings to enterprise customers. While the merger integrations in these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we are confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow increased 2.5% from nearly $334 million in fourth quarter 2009 to $342 million in fourth quarter 2010 due to lower capital expenditures in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to discuss our 2010 results compared to our previous full year 2010 guidance. First, operating revenues declined by 6.5% in 2010 compared to pro forma 2009 operating revenues compared to our previous guidance of an anticipated full year revenue decline of 6.5% to 7%. Second, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow for 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $1.58 billion to $1.62 billion. 
From a diluted earnings per share standpoint, the $3.39 per share we achieved for full year 2010 is at the high end of our latest guidance of $3.36 to $3.46 per share. Finally, we invested $864 million in capital expenditures in 2010, which is within our prior guidance of $825 million to $875 million. The capital that we invested in 2010 included the enablement of high-speed Internet service, IPTV in several markets, expansion of Ethernet availability and fiber to the tower. Our 2011 capital investments will continue to focus on these areas, which will enable future growth.
Now turning to Slide 20. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of non-recurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending Qwest transaction, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. 
For full year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be 4% to 5% lower than 2010 operating revenues, as revenue increases associated with growth in high-speed Internet are expected to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced Universal Service Funding, access line losses and other items. Additionally, due to anticipated revenue growth associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, the revenue impact of the expected continued improvement in the rate of access line loss and the effects of additional fiber investment, we expect the year-over-year rate of revenue declines, excluding the Qwest transaction and any other non-recurring items that may occur, to be in the 2% to 4% range by fourth quarter 2011. The company currently expects 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion or 16% higher than 2010 capital expenditures of $864 million. The increase is primarily due to planned incremental fiber to the tower investment.
We expect the Qwest transaction to close on April 1, therefore, we are not providing full year 2011 free cash flow or earnings per share guidance. However, we are providing guidance regarding several items that collectively are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share by $0.49 to $0.55.
Items that are anticipated to positively affect 2011 diluted earnings per share are expected synergies associated with the Embarq acquisition in the $0.09 to $0.11 range; increased revenues associated with expected growth in high-speed Internet customers, $0.10 to $0.14 per share; increased revenues associated with data transport for wireless carriers, $0.06 to $0.08 per share; and anticipated lower interest expense in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 per share. 
The following items are expected to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share: Lower voice-related revenues primarily due to anticipated access line losses of 7% to 7.5%, in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share; lower access revenues primarily driven by access line losses and continued pressure on access minutes of use, $0.18 to $0.22 per share; start-up losses associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service, $0.12 to $0.14 a share; reduced interstate Universal Service Funding, $0.05 to $0.06 per share; and expected migration of network traffic from a wireless carrier customer, $0.05 to $0.07 per share.
For the first quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.70. The decline in first quarter diluted earnings per share compared to fourth quarter is primarily due to continued decline in access lines, access minutes, the normal annual adjustment to USF revenue, increased payroll taxes and the continued expansion of IPTV.
Now turning to Slide 16. Finally, as we outlined in our press release this morning, there are several items I want to briefly discuss regarding the accounting rules for business combinations that you will want to consider when building a financial model for the combination of CenturyLink and Qwest. None of these items will impact cash flow.
First, purchase accounting rules require that the debt of Qwest be adjusted to fair value at the time of the merger close. Based on Qwest's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2010, the impact of this fair value adjustment would have decreased interest expense for pro forma full year 2011 by approximately $287 million compared to the expected levels absent the fair value adjustment.
Second, deferred revenues and related deferred costs on Qwest's balance sheet must be assigned a fair value. We currently anticipate the fair value of the deferred revenues and related costs to be assigned minimal to no value. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that pro forma 2011 revenues would have been negatively impacted by approximately $140 million and that pro forma 2011 operating expenses will be reduced by approximately $100 million.
Third, the tangible and intangible assets of Qwest must be reflected on the books of the combined company at their fair value. The fair value assignment may significantly impact depreciation and amortization of the customer base. However, the impact cannot be determined at this time. 
Finally, the merger will result in the elimination of approximately $70 million of annual revenues and corresponding expenses related to arms length business relationships between CenturyLink and Qwest today that will become intercompany transactions and subject to elimination following the merger close.
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

We additionally, in terms of long distance declines in revenue, as well as network access and just basic voice revenue, is about $15 million or so from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So that makes up the majority of the declines that we’ll see from fourth to first. And then 2011 versus '10, the EPS items in terms of how much is a continuation, basically, the items that impact the decline in revenues related to access line declines and minutes of use basically are items that do just continue from 2010 to 2011. I mean, we'll continue to see declines in those items. They’re new declines. They're not just carryovers basically. So there's really not very much in terms of carryover.

We'll be able to sell all the products and services, basically all the platforms. We think it's going to really enhance our ability to bring a full array of products, a full bundle, to our customers including wireless. As far as the cost, the cost we'll incur primarily are system costs over time as we bring the billing and begin to bill on our bill the wireless portion of the bill. But other than that, there are not a lot of costs other than just training costs for our employee base, so these are the costs we’ll incur there. As far as timing, we expect to begin selling the service in the next couple of months. We should roll it out and be of course expanding that over for the rest of the year. Regarding the proposed NPRM that the FCC released last week, really a poll of the national broadband plan. It prevents some opportunities and risk for CenturyLink and our rural customers of course. The NPRM is just a starting point. It's not an order, so there's much to be done within the industry to build overall consensus around reform. Obviously, the details and the matter in which the agency ultimately implements and reforms will be critical. We continue to support our approach that includes a reasonable transition period, minimal customer rate increases, no unfunded mandates. And we believe that we’re really, as a combined company with Qwest, we will be well positioned to manage to any of the reforms that may eventually be enacted. As you know, the NPRM proposes to reduce access charges over time. But it also proposes a stabilized of transition by harmonizing rates, reducing arbitrage, minimizing disputes. It also proposes to create an offsetting revenue opportunity, provide access to USS support where it's needed, and it converts USF support from the voice to high-speed data. So we expect a pretty consistent process here, and although certainly any time you see regulatory reform, you have some concerns, the process is starting out about as well as we could expect at this point."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We achieved solid financial and operational performance for the first quarter of 2011 even as we worked toward in April 1 day for the closing of our acquisition of Qwest and the launch of the combined company. Operating revenues are at the top of our guidance and diluted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance and we also achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber growth during the first quarter and continue to see improvements in access line declines.
Now moving to Slide 6, and the deck, we achieved operating revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter at the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items of $0.76 per share, exceeding the top end of guidance by $0.06. Our cash flows remained strong. We generated free cash flow of $528 million during the quarter. There were several factors contributed our operating revenues meeting the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First of all, we lost fewer access lines than the forecasted for the quarter. Second, access decline to a slower rate than we had anticipated, and demand for our strategic product and services continued to show strong growth and strategic revenues increased in percentage of total operating revenues. In first quarter 2011, strategic revenues accounted for 31% of total revenues compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2010.
The growth in strategic revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues is a positive trend that we are focused on continuing in the months ahead. Also, we continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio through deploying high-speed in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband features such as computer support, and online backup services. In the first quarter, we maintained our overall go to market approach, but continued to refine our segmentation, our messaging, our bundled and tools for our sales channels to drive customer growth and add average revenue per customer per unit. We also continue to enhance and expand our advanced data, our IP networks and value-added services for business and enterprise customers. Overall, the monthly recurring revenues continue to look solid in enterprise, our sales for Strategic Products included in MPLS direct Internet access were up 18% year-over-year and first quarter '11. Additionally, we saw an increase of 31% year-over-year sales and this to new customers.
Enterprise recurring revenues are down slightly year-over-year and grew slightly on a sequential basis, thanks to growth in data products, particularly retail ethernet. Also, direct Internet access was a bright spot within enterprise with 31% year-over-year growth. Revenues continued to decline in both enterprise and the SMB space. We had loss revenued down 13% year-over-year in our enterprise operation.
Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 52,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter, demand for broadband remains solid in customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. We entered the quarter at approximately 2.45 million high-speed Internet customers or 40% penetration of total addressable lines. In addition, we continued to see improvement in our rate of access line decline as we continue to focus on new customer acquisitions by targeting the non-customer base as well is enhancing our retention programs. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 106,500 revenues at 13.6% sequential, improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 15.2% improvement over the first quarter of 2010 access line loss level.
We continued to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and business segments which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy resulting in fewer moves, less business lines downsizing and fewer competitive ports. And we're pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of access line loss for the trailing 12 months to 7.5%, a reduction of 8.1% reported in the first quarter of 2010. One of the key ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance in the top 5 Embarq markets. We continued to see strong traction of these markets and the improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company.
We continued to see strong results in DIRECTV sales. as we added more than 34,000 satellites video subscribers in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with almost 662,000 satellites video customers, that's about a 15.4% penetration of primary residential lines. We've also soft launched our Prism link, our CenturyLink Prism service in premium new markets in Tallahassee, in Orlando, Florida, in Raleigh, Durham, North Carolina, making our Prism services available to in a total of 8 markets now. The number of Prism capable households past increasingly 22% in the first quarter. We continue to expect to pass close to 1 million households by the end of the year. We were pleased with the overall progress we are making with our Prism TV service thus far and are confident we'll continuously to see growth in this area.
We continue the success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite video and Prism TV sales helped improve Consumer average unit by $1.11 or 2% in the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010.
And finally, we have begun reselling Verizon wireless products and services to small business customers at CenturyLink markets. Our Consumer losses scheduled to begin in mid-May and select markets and will be expanded to all markets over the next several months to a phased in approach.
Turning now to Slide 8. We continued to make great progress towards completing the integration of Embarq. We completed our fourth marketing conversion. All customers in the state of Florida were converted in March and we now have approximately 75% of Embarq customers on CenturyLink systems. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion comprised of customers in 11 states during the third quarter of this year. We continue to meet our synergy targets and on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies as we projected.
Now moving on to Slide 9. We are pleased to have a close our merger with Qwest and launched combined company on April 1. The excellent work conducted by our integration teams and employees of both companies has resulted in a very smooth transition for us. We have heard positive feedback from our business customers about the value proposition they see have in the economy in greater scale with an enhanced product portfolio and broader access foortprint. We've also implemented CenturyLink's local operating model across all of the Qwest markets now. I believe our strong results for the first quarter, combined with a smooth transition to the combined company, demonstrates the ability of our employees executive our business plans while undertaking the complex job of combining our 2 companies.
Our integration and efforts for the Qwest operation are off to good start. We remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resource sources systems to our SAP platform by year-end. Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which continue over a number of months. Even with the significant cost reductions achieved by Qwest since we announced the merger a year ago, we continue to expect to achieve operating expenses synergias to the $575 million for the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergy of $50 million in the next couple of years. We currently expect achieved $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies from the Qwest acquisition in 2011 and we expect to exit 2011 at annual run rate of about $200 million in synergies.
If we turn to Slide 10, I'll briefly touch on the Savvis merger agreement that we announced such last week involving think this will for both CenturyLink and Savvis. First, the acquisition of Savvis really a positive logical next step for CenturyLink. We believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis' assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth and managed hosting, Cloud Computing and Colocation businesses. The CenturyLink's Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we will create a premier managed hosting cloud provider with global scale.
Additionally, this acquisition will further diversify revenue mix toward a higher growth business segment. With Qwest and outside as approximately 58% of our revenues will come from business customers. It's also important to note that this transaction has a minimal impact on our leverage alignments to maintain our strong financial position and we are pleased to have received confirmation of our credit ratings for all 3 credit agencies, leaving the company with 2 of 3 ratings at investment grade.
Also, the addition of Savvis will provide a clear path for the integration of the legacy Qwest hosting business, so overall, the Savvis transaction makes a strong strategic sense for our company.
Turning now to Slide 11. The combination of CenturyLink and Savvis will position CenturyLink as a global leader in managed hosting Cloud Computing which is growing at a rate of about 20% annually. CenturyLink and Savvis will have a robust national network with over 200 miles of fiber with a global presence across North America, and Europe and Asia. In addition, this transaction will triple CenturyLink's data centers from 16 to 48 and offer a significantly enhanced product depth for our customers.
Savvis leading managed IT services and enterprise grade cloud services with CenturyLink's much larger telecommunications and networking operations and our hosting assets will allow us to gain scale in a rapidly growing industry faster than we could do organically. Also, by leveraging CenturyLink's existing relationships with our many business customers, we will be able to provide Savvis' IT consulting and cloud products to a greatly expanded customer base. With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for some comments on our financial results. Stu?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our first quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today and provide comments on our capital structure. 
Turning to Slide 13, I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of sequential items that occurred during the first quarter, and then I will discuss first quarter normalized results.
First, we incurred approximately $29.6 million of pretax expenses or about $0.06 per share related to integration and severance cost associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5.9 million in pretax transaction and integration costs about $0.01 a share related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69.
Now turning to Slide 14. This slide reflects CenturyLink's results for first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide excludes Qwest's results since the merger closed effective April 1. I'll briefly discuss Qwest first quarter results a little later in my comments.
For first quarter 2011, operating revenues declined $104.7 million to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion in first quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue resulted primarily due to a 7.5% decline in access lines and the anticipated decline in Universal Service Fund revenue. This was partially offset by higher special access revenue due to demand from wireless carriers and the increase in high-speed Internet customers. Cash operating expenses decreased $37 million from $865 million in first quarter 2010 to $828 million at first quarter 2011, primarily due to lower transport costs due to the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal IT network and lower personal costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service into additional markets, as Glen commented on earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $353 million in the first quarter of 2010 to $369 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to planned additions and final valuation adjustments for the Embarq acquisitions. Net income attributed to CenturyLink for the quarter was $233 million compared to $279 million in first quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in first quarter 2011 and $0.93 in first quarter 2010.
We achieved earnings above the top end of our guidance range due to lower affected operating expenses. That year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to anticipated revenue declines we discussed with you and the challenge of reducing costs in the near term due to Qwest transaction and the expansion of IPTV service into additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for achieving successful integration of Qwest are 2 of our primary focus areas. While the merger integrations in these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we're confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow decreased 16.6% from $633 million in first quarter 2010 to $528 million in first quarter 2011. Free cash flow declined in first quarter 2011 primarily due to a $44 million increase in capital expenditures and lower operating cash flow. Our free cash flow calculation is defined as net income, excluding special items, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, less cash paid for income taxes and capital expenditures. We revised our definition of free cash flow due to the impact on cash paid income taxes, of bonus depreciation and the impact of Qwest NOLs going forward.
On Slide 15, we highlight Qwest results for the year. Qwest generated revenue of $2.85 billion, a 4% decline from the same quarter a year ago. Strategic services revenues grew primarily due to an increase in Qwest IQ networking and data transport services as well as higher broadband revenues driven by subscriber growth and an improving mix of higher speed broadband services. These increases were more than offset by a decline in legacy service revenue associated with line losses, along with lower data integration revenues.
Operating expenses, including both cash and noncash expenses, but excluding special items, declined nearly 6% to $2.25 billion due to lower personnel and selling cost. Operating income, excluding special items, grew 2.4% to $593 million. Access lines declined 10.7% from the year ago period. Meanwhile, DSL growth remained healthy at nearly 4% growth year-over-year.
Now turning to Slide 16. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and the integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or similar business transactions. Please note 2011 full year guidance, which is the first column on the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011 and then combined CenturyLink and Qwest results for the remainder of the year.
For full year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $14.9 billion to $15.1 billion, and EPS to range from $2.55 to $2.65, and capital expenditures to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. For second quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.43 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.67. This sequential decline in diluted earnings per share expected in second quarter is due primarily to a decline in voice and access revenue, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and the seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance. Please note on this slide that the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if the Qwest merger was effective January 1, 2011, and the company operated on a combined basis for the full year of 2011. We continued to expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be slightly less than 50% of free cash flow.
On Slide 17, in the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined companies financial results for second quarter 2011 and full year 2011. All of these items are noncash items. Please see the earnings release and the related 10-Q filing for further information.
Additionally, we attached a pro forma first quarter 2011 income statement, which reflects pro forma first quarter results as if the Qwest acquisition closed January 1, 2011. To simplify our guidance and when building your models for 2011, you may want to use this as a base for projecting your pro forma results for 2011. The midpoint of our second quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is $0.65. If you assume that we maintain about that level of earnings in each of the remaining quarters of 2011, and add first quarter pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.70, you get to $2.65 are the top of our pro forma diluted EPS guidance for the year. In essence, we are expecting to be able to offset revenue declines, which by the way, we expect to continue to improve during the year and the cost of our IPTV rollout with the realization of synergies related to Embarq and the Qwest acquisition.
Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we've stated, the board will consume free cash flow next year as we more fully realized expected merger synergies and see further progress with emerging integration of Qwest. We've also indicated that maintaining an investment grade credit metrics is important. Accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012, we will reduce debt by $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the year-end 2010 pro forma level.
This concludes our prepared remarks for the day. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

Looking back at first quarter, in January, the market was looking for a $670 million of EBITDA. After the February print, you guys guided people down on conservative margin expectations and the guidance fell to $625 million. And then you guys just posted up $668 million EBITDA number, basically everyone where everyone thought you would be. But in the meantime, because you guided everyone down, the stock price is down 10%. And now we're looking at the Qwest merger, you guys had a very good plan but your stocks underperforming today and it's because I think people are confused as to whether we're trying to be conservative or things are really getting worse at the combined entity because if you take your CenturyLink stand-alone guidance for revenue, for instance, and add the Qwest revenue from first quarter, it implies adjusting for the eliminations, that the Qwest revenue growth rate will go from a decline of 4% to a decline of over 6% in the rest of the year despite Stewart, I think what you are saying was that revenue growth was that actually going to get better. So I think people are struggling to understand, are we being conservative and we should really just assume that this is the rock-bottom that we're going to do for the year or do we really need to be concerned about what the business is doing because the number seems to suggest that it's is not going to get better for the rest of the year?"

On a pro forma basis, for 2011, we expect to end the year on a combined basis at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. So it could be that some of the elimination entries and some of the acquisition-related adjustments are making it look that way though I'm not sure, I'll have to go back and look at that further. But just all in all, if you take 2010 and 2011, we would expect to end the year, full year at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. In terms of first quarter guidance that we gave versus where we ended up, and I guess versus the guidance that we are giving for second quarter, basically, our expenses were lower than we thought they would be in first quarter primarily due to the -- our bad debt expense was down somewhat about a little less than $6 million. We spent a little bit less rolling out IPTV primarily related to marketing because we had a good funnel from the standpoint of installations that we really didn't want need to push it from a marketing standpoint, so we didn't spend some marketing dollars that we anticipated spending. I guess the pension reduction we didn't really have built into our guidance that we basically froze the pension growth for a non-marketing we did that, I guess, the board approved it actually after the first quarter earnings call. And then just our outside planned maintenance expenses were which typically, in the first quarter, are lower just from a seasonal standpoint, ended up being lower than we had estimated. And then some of the maintenance contracts in IT, I guess, I guess we got a little bit more synergy from the Embarq acquisition. It really didn't expect to get in the first quarter. So that kind of really rounds out first quarter in terms of why we ended up better than we thought we would end up from an expense standpoint. If you look at second quarter, again, it is going to be basically the seasonal maintenance associated with our outside plant activity that we normally experience. And then we do expect to pick up some of the marketing expenses that we didn't incur in the first quarter. And again, we expect -- we think of our bad debt expense was actually a little bit unusually lower in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to drive IPTV and expect that to, as we discussed on last quarter's call, expect that to drive higher expenses more or less throughout the year. From a revenue standpoint, always, first quarter compared with fourth quarter, we have the revenue step down associated with USF. We had that step down first quarter this year. We expect that to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year, so that will account for some of the improvement in the revenue declines and then we expect that to be as well, to show some positive results throughout the remainder of the year in terms of increased revenue to offset some of the declines that will otherwise have."

Basically, at legacy CenturyLink, because of the increased demand from the wireless carriers from fiber to the sell, we would expect to spend about $180 million or so in 2011 for fiber to the sell projects. At legacy Qwest, as you know there, we have a project with respect to increase in High-Speed Internet speeds with our fiber to the nod project. If you -- and basically, we use some of that build to get to fiber to the tower as well. So when you look at a combined fiber to the node and fiber to the tower build out, that legacy Qwest would expect, they would expect to spend about $300 million in 2011. So of the total $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion capital budget, about $0.5 billion of it is due to a combination of fiber to the node and fiber to the tower in 2011."

Of about $76 million related to 2010, that in effect needs to be pulled in 2010 revenue when you put it in the 2 of us together, there's also $216 million of installation revenue on Qwest that basically deferred revenue on the balance sheet has a deferred liability basically it gets amortized to revenue over the expected life of the customer. but the purchase accounting adjustments basically, that gets a fair value of 0, so that revenue basically never gets recognized even though and the cash was previously received on it. So basically, there's about $280 million of revenue that you need to back out of 2010 revenue. If you just take legacy CenturyTel or link and legacy Qwest and add it together. So basically, that's about $18.5 billion of revenue for 2010. And there're comparable adjustments. I think all of that is in the 8-K that we filed and the pro fores. There're comparable adjustments that need would need to be pulled out of 2011 basically. If you just trying to project that legacy CenturyLink and the legacy Qwest them together, the comparable amount that you would pull out of 2011 is about $250 million or so. I think if you make those adjustments, you'll get down to about the 3% or so decline that we do expect. So I think what's happening there, you may be comparing, maybe taking 2010, adding CenturyLink and Qwest together without making those negative adjustments that need to be applied to 2010, and then comparing that to the guidance that we're making and it's looking like a 4% to 5% decline as opposed to the 3% decline that we see."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We achieved solid financial and operational performance for the first quarter of 2011, even as we worked toward an April 1 date for the closing of our acquisition of Qwest and the launch of the combined company. Operating revenues are at the top of our guidance and diluted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance and we also achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber growth during the first quarter and continue to see improvements in access line declines.
Now moving to Slide 6 in the deck, we achieved operating revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, at the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.76 per share, exceeding the top end of guidance by $0.06. Our cash flows remained strong. We generated free cash flow of $528 million during the quarter. There were several factors contributing our operating revenues, meeting the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First of all, we lost fewer access lines than we had forecast for the quarter. Second, access minutes of use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated, and demand for our strategic product and services continues to show strong growth. And strategic revenues continue to increase as a percentage of total operating revenues. In first quarter 2011, strategic revenues accounted for 31% of total revenues, compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2010. The growth in strategic revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues is a positive trend that we are focused on continuing in the months ahead. Also, we continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband features such as computer support and online backup services. In the first quarter, we maintained our overall go-to-market approach, but continued to refine our segmentation, our messaging, our bundled and tools for our sales channels to drive customer growth and average revenue per customer per unit. We also continue to enhance and expand our advanced data, our IP networks and value-added services for business and enterprise customers. Overall, monthly recurring revenues continue to look solid in enterprise, our sales for Strategic Products, which included the net [ph]and MPLS direct Internet access, were up 18% year-over-year and first quarter '11. Additionally, we saw an increase of 31% year-over-year sales -- ND [ph] sales new customers.
Enterprise recurring revenues are down slightly year-over-year and grew slightly on a sequential basis, thanks to growth in data products, particularly retail ethernet. Also, direct Internet access was a bright spot within enterprise, with 31% year-over-year growth. Plus [ph], revenues continued to decline in both enterprise and the SMB space. With lost [ph] revenues down 13% year-over-year in our enterprise operation.
Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 52,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid, and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.45 million high-speed Internet customers or 40% penetration of total addressable lines. In addition, we continue to see improvement in our rate of access line decline as we continue to focus on new customer acquisitions by targeting the non-customer base, as well is enhancing our retention programs. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 106,500 represents a 13.6% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 15.2% improvement over the first quarter of 2010 access line loss level. We continued to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. And we're pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of access line loss for the trailing 12 months to 7.5%, a reduction of 8.1% reported in the first quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance from the top 5 Embarq markets. We continue to see strong traction in these markets and improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company.
We continue to see strong results in DIRECTV sales. as we added more than 34,000 satellite video subscribers in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with almost 662,000 satellite video customers, that's about a 15.4% penetration of primary residential lines. We've also soft launched our Prism link -- excuse me, our CenturyLink Prism service in three new markets in Tallahassee, in Orlando, Florida; in Raleigh; Durham, North Carolina, making our Prism services available in a total of eight markets now. The number of Prism capable households have passed --  increased nearly 22% in the first quarter. We continue to expect to pass close to a million households by the end of the year. We were pleased with the overall progress we are making with our Prism TV service thus far, and are confident we'll continuously to see growth in this area.
We continue the success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite video, and Prism TV sales helped improve consumer average unit by $1.11 or 2% in the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010.
And finally, we have begun reselling Verizon wireless products and services to small business customers in CenturyLink markets. Our consumer loss [ph] scheduled again, in mid-May, in select markets and will be expanded to all markets over the next several months, through a phased-in approach.
Turning now to Slide 8. We continue to make great progress toward completing the integration of Embarq. We completed our fourth marketing conversion. All customers in the state of Florida were converted in March and we now have approximately 75% of Embarq customers on CenturyLink systems. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion, comprised of customers in 11 states, during the third quarter of this year. We continue to meet our synergy targets and on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies as we projected.
Now moving on to Slide 9. We are pleased to have a close our merger with Qwest and launched the combined company on April 1. The excellent work conducted by our integration teams and employees of both companies has resulted in a very smooth transition for us. We have heard positive feedback from our business customers about the value proposition they see in a company with greater scale, with an enhanced product portfolio and broader access footprint. We've also implemented CenturyLink's local operating model across all of the Qwest markets now. I believe our strong results for the first quarter, combined with a smooth transition to the combined company, demonstrates the ability of our employees to executive our business plans while undertaking the complex job of combining our two companies.
Our integration and efforts for the Qwest operation are off to good start. We remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resource sources systems to our SAP platform by year-end. Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which continue over a number of months. Even with the significant cost reductions achieved by Qwest since we announced the merger a year ago, we continue to expect to achieve operating expense synergies of $575 million for the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million in the next couple of years. We currently expect achieved $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies from the Qwest acquisition in 2011 and we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of about $200 million in synergies.
As we turn to Slide 10, I want to briefly touch on the Savvis merger agreement that we announced last week and why we think this transaction is such a good fit for both CenturyLink and Savvis. First, the acquisition of Savvis, really a positive, logical next step for CenturyLink. We believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis' assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in Managed Hosting, Cloud Computing and Colocation businesses. The CenturyLink-Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we will create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. Additionally, this acquisition will further diversify revenue mix toward a higher growth business segment. With Qwest and now Savvis, approximately 58% of our revenues will come from business customers. It's also important to note that this transaction has a minimal impact on our leverage alignments, allowing us to maintain our strong financial position and we're pleased to have received confirmation of our credit ratings by all three credit agencies, leaving the company with two of three ratings at investment grade. Also, the addition of Savvis will provide a clear path for the integration of the legacy Qwest Hosting business, so overall, the Savvis transaction makes strong strategic sense for our company.
Turning now to Slide 11. The combination of CenturyLink and Savvis will position CenturyLink as a global leader in managed hosting cloud computing which is growing at a rate of about 20% annually. CenturyLink and Savvis will have a robust national network with over 200 route miles of fiber, with a global presence across North America, and Europe and Asia. In addition, this transaction will triple CenturyLink's data centers from 16 to 48, and offer significantly enhanced product depth for our customers. Coupling Savvis' leading managed IT services and enterprise grade cloud services with CenturyLink's much larger telecommunications and networking operations, and our hosting assets, will allow us to gain scale in a rapidly growing industry faster than we could do organically. Also, by leveraging CenturyLink's existing relationships with our many business customers, we'll be able to provide Savvis' IT consulting and cloud products to a greatly expanded customer base.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for some comments on our financial results. Stu?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our first quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today, and provide comments on our capital structure.
Turning to Slide 13, I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the first quarter, and then I will discuss first quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $29.6 million of pretax expenses or about $0.06 per share related to integration and severance cost associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5.9 million in pretax transaction and integration cost position [ph]. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69.
Now turning to Slide 14. This slide reflects CenturyLink's results for first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide excludes Qwest's results since the merger closed effective April 1. I'll briefly discuss Qwest first quarter results a little later in my comments.
For first quarter 2011, operating revenues declined $104.7 million to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion in first quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue resulted primarily due to a 7.5% decline in access lines and the anticipated decline in Universal Service Fund revenue. This was partially offset by higher special access revenue due to demand from wireless carriers and the increase in high-speed Internet customers. Cash operating expenses decreased $37 million from $865 million in first quarter 2010 to $828 million at first quarter 2011, primarily due to lower transport cost due to the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal IT network and lower personnel costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher cost associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service into additional markets, as Glen commented on earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $353 million in first quarter of 2010 to $369 million in first quarter of 2011, primarily due to planned additions and final valuation adjustments for the Embarq acquisition. Net income attributed to CenturyLink for the quarter was $233 million compared to $279 million in first quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in first quarter 2011 and $0.93 in first quarter 2010.
We achieved earnings above the end of our -- the top of our guidance range due to lower than expected operating expenses. The year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you, and the challenge of reducing cost in the near term due to Qwest transaction and the expansion of IPTV service into additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving successful integration of Qwest are two of our primary focus areas. While the merging integrations and these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we're confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow decreased 16.6% from $633 million in first quarter 2010 to $528 million in first quarter 2011. Free cash flow declined in first quarter 2011 primarily due to a $44 million increase in capital expenditures and lower operating cash flow. Our free cash flow calculation is defined as net income, excluding special items, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, less cash paid for income taxes and capital expenditures. We revised our definition of free cash flow due to the impact on cash paid income taxes, of bonus depreciation and the impact of Qwest NOLs going forward.
On Slide 15, we highlight Qwest results for the year. Qwest generated revenue of $2.85 billion, a 4% decline from the same quarter a year ago. Strategic services revenues grew, primarily due to an increase in Qwest iQ Networking and data transport services, as well as higher broadband revenues driven by subscriber growth, and an improving mix of higher speed broadband services. These increases were more than offset by a decline in legacy service revenue associated with line losses, along with lower data integration revenues.
Operating expenses, including both cash and noncash expenses, but excluding special items, declined nearly 6% to $2.25 billion due to lower personnel and selling cost. Operating income, excluding special items, grew 2.4% to $593 million. Access lines declined 10.7% from the year ago period. Meanwhile, DSL growth remained healthy at nearly 4% growth year-over-year.
Now turning to Slide 16. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or similar business transactions. Please note, 2011 full-year guidance, which is the first column on the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011 and then combined CenturyLink and Qwest results for the remainder of the year. For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $14.9 billion to $15.1 billion, and EPS to range from $2.55 to $2.65, and capital expenditures to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. For second quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.43 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.67. The sequential decline in diluted earnings per share expected in second quarter is due primarily to a decline in voice and access revenue, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and a seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance. Please note, on this slide, that the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if the Qwest merger was effective January 1, 2011, and the company operated on a combined basis for the full-year of 2011. We continue to expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be slightly less than 50% of free cash flow.
On Slide 17, in the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined company's financial results for second quarter 2011 and full-year 2011. All of these items are noncash items. Please see the earnings release and the related 10-Q filing for further information.
Additionally, we attached a pro forma first quarter 2011 income statement, which reflects pro forma first quarter results as if the Qwest acquisition closed January 1, 2011. To simplify our guidance, and when building your first -- your models for 2011, you may want to use this as a base for projecting your pro forma results for 2011. The midpoint of our second quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is $0.65. If you assume that we maintain about that level of earnings in each of the remaining quarters of 2011 and add first quarter pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.70, you get to $2.65 or the top of our pro forma diluted EPS guidance for the year. In essence, we are expecting to be able to offset revenue declines, which by the way, we expect to continue to improve during the year, and the cost of our IPTV rollout with the realization of synergies related to Embarq and the Qwest acquisition.
Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we have stated, the board will consider use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merging integration of Qwest. We have also indicated that maintaining an investment grade credit metrics is important. Accordingly, we expect, that during 2011 and 2012, we will reduce debt by $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the year-end 2010 pro forma level.
This concludes our prepared remarks for the day. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

Looking back at first quarter, in January, the market was looking for a $670 million of EBITDA. After the February print, you guys guided people down on conservative margin expectations and the guidance fell to $625 million. And then you guys just posted up a $668 million EBITDA number, basically -- exactly where everyone thought you would be. But in the meantime, because you guided everyone down, the stock price is down 10%. And now we're looking at the Qwest merger, you guys have a very good print. But your stock underperforming today, and it's because I think people are confused as to whether -- we're trying to be conservative or things are really getting worse at the combined entity. Because if you take your CenturyLink stand-alone guidance for revenue, for instance, and add the Qwest revenue from first quarter, it implies, adjusting for the eliminations, that the Qwest revenue growth rate will go from a decline of 4% to a decline of over 6% in the rest of the year. Despite, Stewart, which I think you are saying, was that revenue growth is actually going to get better. So I think people are struggling to understand, are we being conservative and we should really just assume that this is the rock-bottom that we're going to do for the year? Or do we really need to be concerned about what the business is doing? Because the number seem to suggest it's is not going to get better for the rest of the year."

On a pro forma basis, for 2011, we expect to end the year, on a combined basis, at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. So it could be that some of the elimination entries and some of the acquisition-related adjustments are making it look that way to you. I'm not sure, I'll have to go back and look at that further. Maybe we can talk later. But just -- all in all, if you take 2010 and 2011, we would expect to end the year -- full-year at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. In terms of first quarter guidance that we gave versus where we ended up, and I guess, versus the guidance that we're giving for second quarter. Basically, our expenses were lower than we thought they would be in first quarter, primarily due to the -- our bad debt expense was down, somewhat about a little less than $6 million. We spent a little bit less rolling out IPTV, primarily related to marketing. Because we had a good funnel from the standpoint of installations that we really didn't want to -- we didn't really need to push it from a marketing standpoint. So we didn't spend some marketing dollars that we had anticipated spending. I guess the pension reduction, we didn't really have built into our guidance, that we basically froze the pension for non-bargaining unit employees. And we did that -- I guess, our board approved it. Actually, after the first quarter earnings call. And then just our outside plant maintenance expenses, were which typically, in the first quarter, are lower just from a seasonal standpoint, ended up being lower than we had estimated. And then some of the -- our maintenance contracts in IT. I guess we got a little bit more synergy from the Embarq acquisition that we really didn't expect to get in the first quarter. So that kind of really rounds out first quarter in terms of why we ended up better than we thought we would end up, from an expense standpoint. If you look at second quarter, again, it is going to be basically, the seasonal maintenance associated with our outside plant activity that we normally experience. And then we do expect to pick up some of the marketing expenses that we didn't incur in the first quarter. And again, expect -- we think our bad debt expense was actually a little bit unusually lower in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to drive IPTV and expect that to, as we discussed on last quarter's call, expect that to drive higher expenses more or less throughout the year. From a revenue standpoint, always, first quarter from -- compared with fourth quarter, we had the revenue step down associated with USF. We had that step down in first quarter this year. We expect that to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year, so that will account for some of the improvement in the revenue decline, and then we expect that IPTV as well, to show some positive results throughout the remainder of the year in terms of increase in revenue to offset Some of the declines that will otherwise see."

The guidance for the year suggests that you're going to basically be at about 4% to 5% decline as a standalone CenturyLink or pro forma company. And given the positive commentary about USF being flat, IPTV should improve. I think you had mentioned before, that there is some opportunity to gain share back in Qwest territory from the SMB business. Would you expect this revenue decline to decelerate from 1Q on? And related to that, I wanted to just follow up on the CapEx side.

But if you look at some of the eliminations that we have associated with the purchase accounting, so we have affiliate revenue where we were a customer Qwest, and they were a customer of us in some cases, of about $76 million related to 2010. That, in effect, needs to be pulled out of  2010 revenue when you put in the two of us together. There's also $216 million of installation revenue on Qwest that basically, a deferred revenue on the balance sheet, has a deferred liability basically. It gets amortized to revenue over the expected lives of the customer. With the purchase accounting adjustments basically, that gets a fair value of 0, so that revenue basically never gets recognized even though -- and the cash was previously received on it. So basically, there's about $280 million of revenue that you need to back out of 2010 revenue. If you just take legacy CenturyTel or Link and legacy Qwest and add it together. So basically, that's about $18.5 billion of revenue for 2010. And they're comparable adjustments. I think all of that is in the 8-K that we filed and in the pro formas. They're comparable adjustments that need would need to be pulled out of 2011 basically. If you're just trying to project out legacy CenturyLink and legacy Qwest and add them together, the comparable amount that you would pull out of 2011 is about $250 million or so. I think if you make those adjustments, you'll get down to about the 3% or so decline that we expect. So I think what's happening there, you may be comparing -- maybe taking 2010, adding CenturyLink and Qwest together without making those negative adjustments that need to be applied to 2010, and then comparing that to the guidance that we're making and it's looking like a 4% to 5% decline as opposed to the 3% decline that we see."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We achieved solid financial and operational performance for the fi",1699,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We achieved solid financial and operational performance for the first quarter of 2011, even as we worked toward an April 1 date for the closing of our acquisition of Qwest and the launch of the combined company. Operating revenues are at the top of our guidance and diluted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance and we also achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber growth in the first quarter and continue to see improvements in access line declines.
Now moving to Slide 6 in the deck, we achieved operating revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $0.76 per share, exceeding the top end of guidance by $0.06. Our cash flows remained strong. We generated free cash flow of $528 million during the quarter. There were several factors contributing our operating revenues meeting the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First of all, we lost fewer access lines than we had forecast for the quarter. Second, access minutes of use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated, and demand for our strategic product and services continues to show strong growth. And strategic revenues continue to increase as a percentage of total operating revenues. In first quarter 2011, strategic revenues accounted for 31% of total revenues compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2010. The growth in strategic revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues is a positive trend that we are focused on continuing in the months ahead. Also, we continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband features such as computer support and online backup services. In the first quarter, we maintained our overall go-to-market approach, but continued to refine our segmentation, our messaging, our bundled and tools for our sales channels to drive customer growth and average revenue per customer per unit. We also continue to enhance and expand our advanced data, our IP networks and value-added services for business and enterprise customers. Overall, monthly recurring revenues continue to look solid in enterprise, our sales for Strategic Products, which included the net [ph] and MPLS direct Internet access, were up 18% year-over-year and first quarter '11. Additionally, we saw an increase of 31% year-over-year sales -- in these sales to new customers.
Enterprise recurring revenues are down slightly year-over-year and grew slightly on a sequential basis, thanks to growth in data products, particularly retail ethernet. Also, direct Internet access was a bright spot within enterprise, with 31% year-over-year growth. Loss revenues continued to decline in both enterprise and the SMB space, with loss revenues down 13% year-over-year in our enterprise operation.
Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 52,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.45 million high-speed Internet customers or 40% penetration of total addressable lines. In addition, we continue to see improvement in our rate of access line decline as we continue to focus on new customer acquisitions by targeting the non-customer base, as well as enhancing our retention programs. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 106,500 represents a 13.6% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 15.2% improvement over the first quarter of 2010 access line loss level. We continue to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. And we're pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of access line loss for the trailing 12 months to 7.5%, a reduction of 8.1% reported in the first quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance from the top 5 Embarq markets. We continue to see strong traction in these markets and improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company.
We continue to see strong results in DIRECTV sales, as we added more than 34,000 satellite video subscribers in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with almost 662,000 satellite video customers, that's about a 15.4% penetration of primary residential lines. We've also soft launched our Prism link -- excuse me, our CenturyLink Prism service in 3 new markets in Tallahassee, in Orlando, Florida; in Raleigh; Durham, North Carolina, making our Prism services available in a total of 8 markets now. The number of Prism capable households passed -- increased nearly 22% in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to pass close to a million households by the end of the year. We were pleased with the overall progress we are making with our Prism TV service thus far, and are confident we'll continue to see growth in this area.
We continue the success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite video and Prism TV sales helped improve consumer average revenue per unit by $1.11 or 2% in the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010.
And finally, we have begun reselling Verizon wireless products and services to small business customers in CenturyLink markets. Our consumer launch is scheduled to begin in mid-May in select markets and will be expanded to all markets over the next several months through a phase-in approach.
Turning now to Slide 8. We continue to make great progress toward completing the integration of Embarq. We completed our fourth marketing conversion. All customers in the state of Florida were converted in March and we now have approximately 75% of Embarq customers on CenturyLink systems. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion comprised of customers in 11 states during the third quarter of this year. We continue to meet our synergy targets and on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies as we projected.
Now moving on to Slide 9. We are pleased to have closed our merger with Qwest and launched the combined company on April 1. The excellent work conducted by our integration teams and employees of both companies has resulted in a very smooth transition for us. We have heard positive feedback from our business customers about the value proposition they see in a company with greater scale, with an enhanced product portfolio and broader access footprint. We've also implemented CenturyLink's local operating model across all of the Qwest markets now. I believe our strong results for the first quarter, combined with a smooth transition to the combined company, demonstrates the ability of our employees to executive our business plans while undertaking the complex job of combining our 2 companies.
Our integration efforts for the Qwest operations are off to good start. We remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resource sources systems to our SAP platform by year-end. Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which continue over a number of months. Even with the significant cost reductions achieved by Qwest since we announced the merger a year ago, we continue to expect to achieve operating expense synergies of $575 million for the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million in the next couple of years. We currently expect to achieve $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies from the Qwest acquisition in 2011 and we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of about $200 million in synergies.
As we turn to Slide 10, I want to briefly touch on the Savvis merger agreement that we announced last week and why we think this transaction is such a good fit for both CenturyLink and Savvis. First, the acquisition of Savvis, really a positive, logical next step for CenturyLink. We believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis' assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in Managed Hosting, Cloud Computing and Colocation businesses. The CenturyLink-Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we will create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. Additionally, this acquisition will further diversify revenue mix toward a higher growth business segment. With Qwest and now Savvis, approximately 58% of our revenues will come from business customers. It's also important to note that this transaction has a minimal impact on our leverage, allowing us to maintain our strong financial position and we're pleased to have received confirmation of our credit ratings by all 3 credit agencies, leaving the company with 2 of 3 ratings at investment grade. Also, the addition of Savvis will provide a clear path for the integration of the legacy Qwest Hosting business. So overall, the Savvis transaction makes strong strategic sense for our company.
Turning now to Slide 11. The combination of CenturyLink and Savvis will position CenturyLink as a global leader in managed hosting cloud computing, which is growing at a rate of about 20% annually. CenturyLink and Savvis will have a robust national network with over 200 route miles of fiber, with a global presence across North America, and Europe and Asia. In addition, this transaction will triple CenturyLink's data centers from 16 to 48, and offer significantly enhanced product depth for our customers. Coupling Savvis' leading managed IT services and enterprise grade cloud services with CenturyLink's much larger telecommunications and networking operations and our hosting assets will allow us to gain scale in a rapidly growing industry faster than we could do organically. Also by leveraging CenturyLink's existing relationships with our many business customers, we'll be able to provide Savvis' IT consulting and cloud products to a greatly expanded customer base.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for some comments on our financial results. Stu?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our first quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today, and provide comments on our capital structure.
Turning to Slide 13, I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the first quarter, and then I will discuss first quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $29.6 million of pretax expenses or about $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5.9 million in pretax transactions and integration cost positions [ph]. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69.
Now turning to Slide 14. This slide reflects CenturyLink's results for first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide excludes Qwest's results since the merger closed effective April 1. I'll briefly discuss Qwest first quarter results a little later in my comments.
For first quarter 2011, operating revenues declined $104.7 million to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion in first quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue resulted primarily due to a 7.5% decline in access lines and the anticipated decline in Universal Service Fund revenue. This was partially offset by higher special access revenue due to demand from wireless carriers and the increase in high-speed Internet customers. Cash operating expenses decreased $37 million from $865 million in first quarter 2010 to $828 million in first quarter 2011, primarily due to lower transport costs due to the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal IT network and lower personnel costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service into additional markets, as Glen commented on earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $353 million in first quarter of 2010 to $369 million in first quarter of 2011, primarily due to planned additions and final valuation adjustments for the Embarq acquisition. Net income attributed to CenturyLink for the quarter was $233 million compared to $279 million in first quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in first quarter 2011 and $0.93 in first quarter 2010.
We achieved earnings above the end of our -- the top of our guidance range due to lower than expected operating expenses. The year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you, and the challenge of reducing costs in the near term due to the Qwest transaction and the expansion of IPTV service into additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving successful integration of Qwest are 2 of our primary focus areas. While the merging integrations and these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we're confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow decreased 16.6% from $633 million in first quarter 2010 to $528 million in first quarter 2011. Free cash flow declined in first quarter 2011 primarily due to a $44 million increase in capital expenditures and lower operating cash flow. Our free cash flow calculation is defined as net income excluding special items, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, less cash paid for income taxes and capital expenditures. We revised our definition of free cash flow due to the impact on cash paid income taxes, of bonus depreciation and the impact of Qwest NOLs going forward.
On Slide 15, we highlight Qwest's results for the year. Qwest generated revenue of $2.85 billion, a 4% decline from the same quarter a year ago. Strategic services revenues grew primarily due to an increase in Qwest iQ Networking and data transport services, as well as higher broadband revenues driven by subscriber growth and an improving mix of higher speed broadband services. These increases were more than offset by a decline in legacy service revenue associated with line losses, along with lower data integration revenues.
Operating expenses, including both cash and noncash expenses but excluding special items, declined nearly 6% to $2.25 billion due to lower personnel and selling costs. Operating income, excluding special items, grew 2.4% to $593 million. Access lines declined 10.7% from the year ago period. Meanwhile, DSL growth remained healthy at nearly 4% growth year-over-year.
Now turning to Slide 16. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or similar business transactions. Please note, 2011 full-year guidance, which is the first column on the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011 and then combined CenturyLink and Qwest results for the remainder of the year. For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $14.9 billion to $15.1 billion, and EPS to range from $2.55 to $2.65 and capital expenditures to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. For second quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.43 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.67. The sequential decline in diluted earnings per share expected in second quarter is due primarily to a decline in voice and access revenue, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and a seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance. Please note on this slide that the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if the Qwest merger was effective January 1, 2011 and the company operated on a combined basis for the full-year of 2011. We continue to expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be slightly less than 50% of free cash flow.
On Slide 17, in the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined company's financial results for second quarter 2011 and full-year 2011. All of these items are noncash items. Please see the earnings release and the related 10-Q filing for further information.
Additionally, we attached a pro forma first quarter 2011 income statement which reflects pro forma first quarter results as if the Qwest acquisition closed January 1, 2011. To simplify our guidance, and when building your first -- your models for 2011, you may want to use this as a base for projecting your pro forma results for 2011. The midpoint of our second quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is $0.65. If you assume that we maintain about that level of earnings in each of the remaining quarters of 2011 and add first quarter pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.70, you get to $2.65 or the top of our pro forma diluted EPS guidance for the year. In essence, we are expecting to be able to offset revenue declines, which by the way we expect to continue to improve during the year, and the cost of our IPTV rollout with the realization of synergies related to Embarq and the Qwest acquisition.
Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we have stated, the board will consider use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merging integration of Qwest. We have also indicated that maintaining an investment grade credit metrics is important. Accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012 we will reduce debt by $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the year-end 2010 pro forma level.

Looking back at first quarter, in January, the market was looking for a $670 million of EBITDA. After the February print, you guys guided people down on conservative margin expectations and the guidance fell to $625 million. And then you guys just posted up a $668 million EBITDA number, basically -- exactly where everyone thought you would be. But in the meantime, because you guided everyone down, the stock price is down 10%. And now we're looking at the Qwest merger, you guys have a very good print. But your stock is underperforming today and it's because I think people are confused as to whether -- we're trying to be conservative or things are really getting worse at the combined entity. Because if you take your CenturyLink stand-alone guidance for revenue, for instance, and add the Qwest revenue from first quarter, it implies, adjusting for the eliminations, that the Qwest revenue growth rate will go from a decline of 4% to a decline of over 6% in the rest of the year. Despite, Stewart, which I think you are saying, was that revenue growth is actually going to get better. So I think people are struggling to understand, are we being conservative and we should really just assume that this is the rock bottom that we're going to do for the year? Or do we really need to be concerned about what the business is doing, because the number seem to suggest it's is not going to get better for the rest of the year?"

On a pro forma basis, for 2011, we expect to end the year, on a combined basis, at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. So it could be that some of the elimination entries and some of the acquisition-related adjustments are making it look that way to you. I'm not sure, I'll have to go back and look at that further. Maybe we can talk later. But just -- all in all, if you take 2010 and 2011, we would expect to end the year -- full-year at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. In terms of the first quarter guidance that we gave versus where we ended up, and I guess versus the guidance that we're giving for second quarter, basically our expenses were lower than we thought they would be in first quarter, primarily due to the -- our bad debt expense was down somewhat, about a little less than $6 million. We spent a little bit less rolling out IPTV, primarily related to marketing because we had a good funnel from the standpoint of installations that we really didn't want to -- we didn't really need to push it from a marketing standpoint, so we didn't spend some marketing dollars that we had anticipated spending. I guess the pension reduction we didn't really have built into our guidance, that we basically froze the pension for non-bargaining unit employees. And we did that -- I guess, our board approved it actually after the first quarter earnings call. And then just our outside plant maintenance expenses, which typically in the first quarter are lower just from a seasonal standpoint, ended up being lower than we had estimated. And then some of the -- our maintenance contracts in IT. I guess we got a little bit more synergy from the Embarq acquisition that we really didn't expect to get in the first quarter. So that kind of really rounds out first quarter in terms of why we ended up better than we thought we would end up from an expense standpoint. If you look at second quarter, again, it's going to be basically the seasonal maintenance associated with our outside plant activity that we normally experience. And then we do expect to pick up some of the marketing expenses that we didn't incur in the first quarter. And again, expect -- we think our bad debt expense was actually a little bit unusually lower in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to drive IPTV and expect that to, as we discussed on last quarter's call, expect that to drive higher expenses more or less throughout the year. From a revenue standpoint, always, first quarter from -- compared with fourth quarter, we had the revenue step down associated with USF. We had that step down in first quarter this year. We expect that to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year, so that will account for some of the improvement in the revenue decline, and then we expect IPTV as well to show some positive results throughout the remainder of the year in terms of increase in revenue to offset some of the declines that we'll otherwise see."

But if you look at some of the eliminations that we have associated with the purchase accounting, so we have affiliate revenue where we were a customer of Qwest and they were a customer of us in some cases, of about $76 million related to 2010 that in effect needs to be pulled out of 2010 revenue when you're putting the 2 of us together. There's also $216 million of installation revenue on Qwest that basically is deferred revenue on the balance sheet, is a deferred liability basically. It gets amortized to revenue over the expected lives of the customer. With the purchase accounting adjustments, basically that gets a fair value of 0, so that revenue basically never gets recognized even though -- and the cash was previously received on it. So basically, there's about $280 million of revenue that you need to back out of 2010 revenue if you just take legacy CenturyTel or Link and legacy Qwest and add it together. So basically, that's about $18.5 billion of revenue for 2010. And they're comparable adjustments. I think all of that is in the 8-K that we filed and in the pro formas. They're comparable adjustments that would need to be pulled out of 2011, basically. If you're just trying to project out legacy CenturyLink and legacy Qwest and add them together, the comparable amount that you would pull out of 2011 is about $250 million or so. I think if you make those adjustments, you'll get down to about the 3% or so decline that we expect. So I think what's happening there, you may be comparing -- maybe taking 2010, adding CenturyLink and Qwest together without making those negative adjustments that need to be applied to 2010, and then comparing that to the guidance that we're making and it's looking like a 4% to 5% decline as opposed to the 3% decline that we see."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We achieved solid financial and operational performance for the first quarter of 2011, even as we worked toward an April 1 date for the closing of our acquisition of Qwest and the launch of the combined company. Operating revenues are at the top of our guidance and diluted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance and we also achieved solid high-speed Internet subscriber growth in the first quarter and continue to see improvements in access line declines.
Now moving to Slide 6 in the deck, we achieved operating revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $0.76 per share, exceeding the top end of guidance by $0.06. Our cash flows remained strong. We generated free cash flow of $528 million during the quarter. There were several factors contributing our operating revenues meeting the top end of our previous guidance for the quarter. First of all, we lost fewer access lines than we had forecast for the quarter. Second, access minutes of use declined at a slower rate than we had anticipated, and demand for our strategic product and services continues to show strong growth. And strategic revenues continue to increase as a percentage of total operating revenues. In first quarter 2011, strategic revenues accounted for 31% of total revenues compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2010. The growth in strategic revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues is a positive trend that we are focused on continuing in the months ahead. Also, we continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets, as well as adding incremental value through broadband features such as computer support and online backup services. In the first quarter, we maintained our overall go-to-market approach, but continued to refine our segmentation, our messaging, our bundled and tools for our sales channels to drive customer growth and average revenue per customer per unit. We also continue to enhance and expand our advanced data, our IP networks and value-added services for business and enterprise customers. Overall, monthly recurring revenues continue to look solid in enterprise, our sales for Strategic Products, which included the net [ph] and MPLS direct Internet access, were up 18% year-over-year and first quarter '11. Additionally, we saw an increase of 31% year-over-year sales -- in these sales to new customers.
Enterprise recurring revenues are down slightly year-over-year and grew slightly on a sequential basis, thanks to growth in data products, particularly retail ethernet. Also, direct Internet access was a bright spot within enterprise, with 31% year-over-year growth. Loss revenues continued to decline in both enterprise and the SMB space, with loss revenues down 13% year-over-year in our enterprise operation.
Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 52,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2.45 million high-speed Internet customers or 40% penetration of total addressable lines. In addition, we continue to see improvement in our rate of access line decline as we continue to focus on new customer acquisitions by targeting the non-customer base, as well as enhancing our retention programs. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 106,500 represents a 13.6% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 15.2% improvement over the first quarter of 2010 access line loss level. We continue to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy resulting in fewer moves, less business line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. And we're pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of access line loss for the trailing 12 months to 7.5%, a reduction of 8.1% reported in the first quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance from the top 5 Embarq markets. We continue to see strong traction in these markets and improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company.
We continue to see strong results in DIRECTV sales, as we added more than 34,000 satellite video subscribers in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with almost 662,000 satellite video customers, that's about a 15.4% penetration of primary residential lines. We've also soft launched our Prism link -- excuse me, our CenturyLink Prism service in 3 new markets in Tallahassee, in Orlando, Florida; in Raleigh; Durham, North Carolina, making our Prism services available in a total of 8 markets now. The number of Prism capable households passed -- increased nearly 22% in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to pass close to a million households by the end of the year. We were pleased with the overall progress we are making with our Prism TV service thus far, and are confident we'll continue to see growth in this area.
We continue the success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite video and Prism TV sales helped improve consumer average revenue per unit by $1.11 or 2% in the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010.
And finally, we have begun reselling Verizon wireless products and services to small business customers in CenturyLink markets. Our consumer launch is scheduled to begin in mid-May in select markets and will be expanded to all markets over the next several months through a phase-in approach.
Turning now to Slide 8. We continue to make great progress toward completing the integration of Embarq. We completed our fourth marketing conversion. All customers in the state of Florida were converted in March and we now have approximately 75% of Embarq customers on CenturyLink systems. We also remain on schedule to complete the fifth and final Embarq customer billing conversion comprised of customers in 11 states during the third quarter of this year. We continue to meet our synergy targets and on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies as we projected.
Now moving on to Slide 9. We are pleased to have closed our merger with Qwest and launched the combined company on April 1. The excellent work conducted by our integration teams and employees of both companies has resulted in a very smooth transition for us. We have heard positive feedback from our business customers about the value proposition they see in a company with greater scale, with an enhanced product portfolio and broader access footprint. We've also implemented CenturyLink's local operating model across all of the Qwest markets now. I believe our strong results for the first quarter, combined with a smooth transition to the combined company, demonstrates the ability of our employees to executive our business plans while undertaking the complex job of combining our 2 companies.
Our integration efforts for the Qwest operations are off to good start. We remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resource sources systems to our SAP platform by year-end. Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which continue over a number of months. Even with the significant cost reductions achieved by Qwest since we announced the merger a year ago, we continue to expect to achieve operating expense synergies of $575 million for the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million in the next couple of years. We currently expect to achieve $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies from the Qwest acquisition in 2011 and we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of about $200 million in synergies.
As we turn to Slide 10, I want to briefly touch on the Savvis merger agreement that we announced last week and why we think this transaction is such a good fit for both CenturyLink and Savvis. First, the acquisition of Savvis, really a positive, logical next step for CenturyLink. We believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis' assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in Managed Hosting, Cloud Computing and Colocation businesses. The CenturyLink-Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we will create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. Additionally, this acquisition will further diversify revenue mix toward a higher growth business segment. With Qwest and now Savvis, approximately 58% of our revenues will come from business customers. It's also important to note that this transaction has a minimal impact on our leverage, allowing us to maintain our strong financial position and we're pleased to have received confirmation of our credit ratings by all 3 credit agencies, leaving the company with 2 of 3 ratings at investment grade. Also, the addition of Savvis will provide a clear path for the integration of the legacy Qwest Hosting business. So overall, the Savvis transaction makes strong strategic sense for our company.
Turning now to Slide 11. The combination of CenturyLink and Savvis will position CenturyLink as a global leader in managed hosting cloud computing, which is growing at a rate of about 20% annually. CenturyLink and Savvis will have a robust national network with over 200 route miles of fiber, with a global presence across North America, and Europe and Asia. In addition, this transaction will triple CenturyLink's data centers from 16 to 48, and offer significantly enhanced product depth for our customers. Coupling Savvis' leading managed IT services and enterprise grade cloud services with CenturyLink's much larger telecommunications and networking operations and our hosting assets will allow us to gain scale in a rapidly growing industry faster than we could do organically. Also by leveraging CenturyLink's existing relationships with our many business customers, we'll be able to provide Savvis' IT consulting and cloud products to a greatly expanded customer base.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for some comments on our financial results. Stu?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our first quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of the 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today, and provide comments on our capital structure.
Turning to Slide 13, I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the first quarter, and then I will discuss first quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $29.6 million of pretax expenses or about $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5.9 million in pretax transactions and integration cost positions [ph]. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.76 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69.
Now turning to Slide 14. This slide reflects CenturyLink's results for first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide excludes Qwest's results since the merger closed effective April 1. I'll briefly discuss Qwest first quarter results a little later in my comments.
For first quarter 2011, operating revenues declined $104.7 million to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion in first quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue resulted primarily due to a 7.5% decline in access lines and the anticipated decline in Universal Service Fund revenue. This was partially offset by higher special access revenue due to demand from wireless carriers and the increase in high-speed Internet customers. Cash operating expenses decreased $37 million from $865 million in first quarter 2010 to $828 million in first quarter 2011, primarily due to lower transport costs due to the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal IT network and lower personnel costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of CenturyLink's Prism TV service into additional markets, as Glen commented on earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $353 million in first quarter of 2010 to $369 million in first quarter of 2011, primarily due to planned additions and final valuation adjustments for the Embarq acquisition. Net income attributed to CenturyLink for the quarter was $233 million compared to $279 million in first quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in first quarter 2011 and $0.93 in first quarter 2010.
We achieved earnings above the end of our -- the top of our guidance range due to lower than expected operating expenses. The year-over-year decrease in net income and earnings per share is due to anticipated revenue declines we've discussed with you, and the challenge of reducing costs in the near term due to the Qwest transaction and the expansion of IPTV service into additional markets. Completing the successful integration of Embarq and planning for and achieving successful integration of Qwest are 2 of our primary focus areas. While the merging integrations and these product expansions impact our operating costs in the near term, we're confident that these represent investments in the future success and growth of CenturyLink.
Finally, our free cash flow decreased 16.6% from $633 million in first quarter 2010 to $528 million in first quarter 2011. Free cash flow declined in first quarter 2011 primarily due to a $44 million increase in capital expenditures and lower operating cash flow. Our free cash flow calculation is defined as net income excluding special items, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, less cash paid for income taxes and capital expenditures. We revised our definition of free cash flow due to the impact on cash paid income taxes, of bonus depreciation and the impact of Qwest NOLs going forward.
On Slide 15, we highlight Qwest's results for the year. Qwest generated revenue of $2.85 billion, a 4% decline from the same quarter a year ago. Strategic services revenues grew primarily due to an increase in Qwest iQ Networking and data transport services, as well as higher broadband revenues driven by subscriber growth and an improving mix of higher speed broadband services. These increases were more than offset by a decline in legacy service revenue associated with line losses, along with lower data integration revenues.
Operating expenses, including both cash and noncash expenses but excluding special items, declined nearly 6% to $2.25 billion due to lower personnel and selling costs. Operating income, excluding special items, grew 2.4% to $593 million. Access lines declined 10.7% from the year ago period. Meanwhile, DSL growth remained healthy at nearly 4% growth year-over-year.
Now turning to Slide 16. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, any changes in regulation and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or similar business transactions. Please note, 2011 full-year guidance, which is the first column on the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011 and then combined CenturyLink and Qwest results for the remainder of the year. For full-year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $14.9 billion to $15.1 billion, and EPS to range from $2.55 to $2.65 and capital expenditures to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. For second quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.43 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.67. The sequential decline in diluted earnings per share expected in second quarter is due primarily to a decline in voice and access revenue, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and a seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance. Please note on this slide that the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if the Qwest merger was effective January 1, 2011 and the company operated on a combined basis for the full-year of 2011. We continue to expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be slightly less than 50% of free cash flow.
On Slide 17, in the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined company's financial results for second quarter 2011 and full-year 2011. All of these items are noncash items. Please see the earnings release and the related 10-Q filing for further information.
Additionally, we attached a pro forma first quarter 2011 income statement which reflects pro forma first quarter results as if the Qwest acquisition closed January 1, 2011. To simplify our guidance, and when building your first -- your models for 2011, you may want to use this as a base for projecting your pro forma results for 2011. The midpoint of our second quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is $0.65. If you assume that we maintain about that level of earnings in each of the remaining quarters of 2011 and add first quarter pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.70, you get to $2.65 or the top of our pro forma diluted EPS guidance for the year. In essence, we are expecting to be able to offset revenue declines, which by the way we expect to continue to improve during the year, and the cost of our IPTV rollout with the realization of synergies related to Embarq and the Qwest acquisition.
Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we have stated, the board will consider use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merging integration of Qwest. We have also indicated that maintaining an investment grade credit metrics is important. Accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012 we will reduce debt by $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the year-end 2010 pro forma level.
This concludes our prepared remarks for the day. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

Looking back at first quarter, in January, the market was looking for a $670 million of EBITDA. After the February print, you guys guided people down on conservative margin expectations and the guidance fell to $625 million. And then you guys just posted up a $668 million EBITDA number, basically -- exactly where everyone thought you would be. But in the meantime, because you guided everyone down, the stock price is down 10%. And now we're looking at the Qwest merger, you guys have a very good print. But your stock is underperforming today and it's because I think people are confused as to whether -- we're trying to be conservative or things are really getting worse at the combined entity. Because if you take your CenturyLink stand-alone guidance for revenue, for instance, and add the Qwest revenue from first quarter, it implies, adjusting for the eliminations, that the Qwest revenue growth rate will go from a decline of 4% to a decline of over 6% in the rest of the year. Despite, Stewart, which I think you are saying, was that revenue growth is actually going to get better. So I think people are struggling to understand, are we being conservative and we should really just assume that this is the rock bottom that we're going to do for the year? Or do we really need to be concerned about what the business is doing, because the number seem to suggest it's is not going to get better for the rest of the year?"

On a pro forma basis, for 2011, we expect to end the year, on a combined basis, at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. So it could be that some of the elimination entries and some of the acquisition-related adjustments are making it look that way to you. I'm not sure, I'll have to go back and look at that further. Maybe we can talk later. But just -- all in all, if you take 2010 and 2011, we would expect to end the year -- full-year at about a 3% decline compared with 2010. In terms of the first quarter guidance that we gave versus where we ended up, and I guess versus the guidance that we're giving for second quarter, basically our expenses were lower than we thought they would be in first quarter, primarily due to the -- our bad debt expense was down somewhat, about a little less than $6 million. We spent a little bit less rolling out IPTV, primarily related to marketing because we had a good funnel from the standpoint of installations that we really didn't want to -- we didn't really need to push it from a marketing standpoint, so we didn't spend some marketing dollars that we had anticipated spending. I guess the pension reduction we didn't really have built into our guidance, that we basically froze the pension for non-bargaining unit employees. And we did that -- I guess, our board approved it actually after the first quarter earnings call. And then just our outside plant maintenance expenses, which typically in the first quarter are lower just from a seasonal standpoint, ended up being lower than we had estimated. And then some of the -- our maintenance contracts in IT. I guess we got a little bit more synergy from the Embarq acquisition that we really didn't expect to get in the first quarter. So that kind of really rounds out first quarter in terms of why we ended up better than we thought we would end up from an expense standpoint. If you look at second quarter, again, it's going to be basically the seasonal maintenance associated with our outside plant activity that we normally experience. And then we do expect to pick up some of the marketing expenses that we didn't incur in the first quarter. And again, expect -- we think our bad debt expense was actually a little bit unusually lower in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to drive IPTV and expect that to, as we discussed on last quarter's call, expect that to drive higher expenses more or less throughout the year. From a revenue standpoint, always, first quarter from -- compared with fourth quarter, we had the revenue step down associated with USF. We had that step down in first quarter this year. We expect that to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year, so that will account for some of the improvement in the revenue decline, and then we expect IPTV as well to show some positive results throughout the remainder of the year in terms of increase in revenue to offset some of the declines that we'll otherwise see."

But if you look at some of the eliminations that we have associated with the purchase accounting, so we have affiliate revenue where we were a customer of Qwest and they were a customer of us in some cases, of about $76 million related to 2010 that in effect needs to be pulled out of 2010 revenue when you're putting the 2 of us together. There's also $216 million of installation revenue on Qwest that basically is deferred revenue on the balance sheet, is a deferred liability basically. It gets amortized to revenue over the expected lives of the customer. With the purchase accounting adjustments, basically that gets a fair value of 0, so that revenue basically never gets recognized even though -- and the cash was previously received on it. So basically, there's about $280 million of revenue that you need to back out of 2010 revenue if you just take legacy CenturyTel or Link and legacy Qwest and add it together. So basically, that's about $18.5 billion of revenue for 2010. And they're comparable adjustments. I think all of that is in the 8-K that we filed and in the pro formas. They're comparable adjustments that would need to be pulled out of 2011, basically. If you're just trying to project out legacy CenturyLink and legacy Qwest and add them together, the comparable amount that you would pull out of 2011 is about $250 million or so. I think if you make those adjustments, you'll get down to about the 3% or so decline that we expect. So I think what's happening there, you may be comparing -- maybe taking 2010, adding CenturyLink and Qwest together without making those negative adjustments that need to be applied to 2010, and then comparing that to the guidance that we're making and it's looking like a 4% to 5% decline as opposed to the 3% decline that we see."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We delivered solid financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2011, including revenue in line with our guidance range, and improved access line trends. Our second quarter 2011 results are significantly impacted by noncash accounting charges resulting from purchase price accounting for the Qwest transaction. These charges significantly impact our net income and earnings per share, depreciation and amortization increases as we amortize the value of size of the Qwest customer base. However, it is very important to note that the purchase price accounting adjustments have no impact on the cash close of the company and also the accounting adjustment should not in any way affect the economics of the Qwest acquisition. We continue to believe the Qwest transaction is a great strategic combination to improve the growth characteristics of our combined company.
Initial Qwest integration efforts are underway and we have now implemented our local operating model in the legacy Qwest markets. in the second quarter is in line with our expectations. August 9, we expect to launch the CenturyLink brand into Qwest markets. Also, the final Embarq conversion was completed in late July, marking the end of all major integration activities associating with that transaction of approximately 24, 25 months following the close. We have a couple of smaller systems conversions, we'll have the vast majority is now done. And we on track to achieve $375 million in annual run rate synergies later this year. Additionally, we're pleased to welcome Savvis to the CenturyLink family following the close of the transaction with them on July 15.
Now moving to Slide 5 in the deck, I'll cover some financial highlights for the quarter. We achieved operating revenues of $4.4 billion for ht quarter, hitting the lower end of our guidance range. The strategic revenue grew by 6% and legacy revenue declined 10.5% as compared with pro forma second quarter 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.44 per share, the lower guidance range due to higher than anticipated amortization related to the business combination accounting of the Qwest properties. Excluding this unexpected increase, earnings per share would be $0.64 and in line with our initial guidance range. Excluding the impact of noncash items, our cash flows remain strong as we generated $950 million of free cash flow during the quarter. Strategic revenue growth of $98 million was driven by High-Speed Internet, specialized and MPLS growth over the past year.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. During the second quarter, we added over 12,000 High-Speed Internet customers. Demand in legacy CenturyLink market is solid and we achieved higher year-over-year inbound sales in legacy Qwest and CenturyLink markets through the second quarter compared to pro forma second quarter 2010. However, the strong inbound performance was offset by higher than anticipated churned of stand-alone High-Speed Internet customers in the legacy Qwest markets. We've taken steps through competitive bundles and Saval to mitigate this churn which we believe will improve net borrowing additions in the coming months.
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.43 million HSI customers and approximately 50.1% penetration of total addressable access lines. As we mentioned on the earnings call last quarter, CenturyLink and Qwest had different methodologies for accounting access lines. The chart on this slide reflects the methodology adjustments to a standardized CenturyLink and Qwest subscriber accounts. On a combined basis, we continued to see improvement in our rate of access line decline to continue to focus on new customer acquisition by targeting the non-customer base, as well as enhancing our retention programs. Our second quarter line loss were approximately 300,000, represents an 18.6% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2010 access line loss.
We continued to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments though we are not seeing much incremental business activity in our markets this year.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss from a trailing 12 months to 7.4%, a reduction from a pro forma trailing 12-month line loss of 8.2% in the second quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance of the top 5 Embarq markets, and we have continued to see strong traction in these markets and the improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company. We continue to see solid results in DIRECTV sales and we added more than 14,700 satellite videos subscribers in the second quarter. We ended the quarter at nearly 1.7 million satellite video customers.
Our Prism services are available in a total of 8 markets now and we expect the number of Prism cable households to reach to close to 1 million households by the end of this year. During the second quarter 2011, High-Speed Internet products attachment to our Prism service was 91% and voice attachment was 79%. We are pleased with the overall progress we're making with Prism TV service thus far this year and we expect to continue success in the months ahead.
We are also seeing continued success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite, video and Prism TV sales improved Consumer residential per unit by about $2.18 to 4.3% to $53.29 in the second quarter 2011 over the second quarter of 2010. And finally, we launched the Verizon Wireless in the second quarter of this year. We launched first the small businesses earlier in the quarter and the process of a phased rollout to consumers on the CenturyLink side across retail and call centers. We do have access to the full suite of Verizon's services and handsets and look to grow this is an important part of our bundle, along with the VoIP, high-speed Internet and video products.
As previously disclosed in the second quarter, we began a segment reporting for our 3 major operating, regional markets group, Business Markets Group and wholesale markets group. On Slide 7, I'll briefly review some highlights from each of these segments. And later, Stewart will walk you through the financial performance by segment.
Starting with the regional markets group or RMG. We implemented our local operating model organization across the legacy Qwest markets effective April 1 and we are receiving  positive feedback from customers and employees as a result of this implementation. We also High-Speed Internet sales trends were higher, however, we did experience higher than anticipated churned standalone broadband stand-alone in the legacy Qwest markets as I mentioned earlier. We have implemented bundle and phase strategies to mitigate this churn and expect to see improvement in the coming months.
RMG's strategic data sales, that is ethernet, MPLS and voice over IP continued to post strong growth trends. 2011 strategic revenue is up 6.2% year-over-year. Additionally, sales productivity in the small business market improved due to target bundle offerings and response rates were up 16% with our Go to Market sales efforts.
Moving to our second segment, Business Markets Group or BMG. We're encouraged by improving sales trend with average MRR or monthly recurring revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Second quarter 2011 was up 3.2% in the first quarter of '11, and this follow the first quarter of '11, fourth quarter of '10 increase of 2.8%. MPLS revenue grew 11% year-over-year and we continue to have success acquiring large multilocation networks in the commercial enterprise space. We are expanding our customer facing sales capacity by adding front-line sales professionals across the country. We have also experienced strong performance in retaining existing customers of total contract value renewals in second quarter of '11 up 23% from the first quarter of 2011.
We continued to leverage our expanded access footprint in the new combined company also met through ethernet expansion continues. Ethernet Private Line products being seeing strong customer acceptance with our enterprise customers.
Turning to Slide 8, a few highlights regarding our Wholesale Markets Group or WMG. We continued to see strong demand from wireless providers to increase bandwidth which continues to drive our fiber to the sale efforts. This wireless bandwidth, demand is provided a positive impact on our special access revenues but we do anticipate these revenues to flatten somewhat in the second half of the year, as wireless carriers migrate away from traditional connections from to fiber-based ethernet connections. Basically, we will cannibalize some of our specialty access to the cell tower revenue but expect the ethernet revenue to grow into the future as demand is driven higher by the growing broadband traffic.
Turning to Slide 9. We completed the fifth and final customer billing conversion in late July which included customers in 11 states and now have Embarq customers on retail Embarq customers of CenturyLink systems. We're pleased that we were able to complete the major Embarq integration activities within approximately 25 months following the close. At the short end of the 24 to 36-month integration range we originally anticipated. And we continued to meet our synergy targets and are on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies by year-end 2011.
On the Qwest side, we substantially completed organization designs for the combined company by the end of the second quarter and we remain on track to depleted conversion of Qwest financial and human resources systems, to our SAP platform by year-end.
Additionally, in network grooming activities are underway which will continue over a number of months in the Qwest markets. We achieved $70 million in synergies during the second quarter, driven by corporate overhead reduction and network alignment activities and continue to expect to achieve $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies in 2011. And we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of approximately $190 million to $200 million synergy level. We continued to expect to achieve operating expense synergy of $575 million over the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million over the next couple of years.
If we turn to Slide 10, we completed the acquisition of Savvis on July 15, and will operate as a separate business unit. It will be headquartered in St. Louis and we believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis's assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in managed hosting cloud computing and collocation businesses out of CenturyLink's Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we'll create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. And based on a 25% growth in the hosting business, we expect revenues of approximately $1 billion for 2011 and operating cash flow of approximately $275 million. So overall, the Savvis transaction makes a strong strategic sense and operational sense for our company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for comments on our financial results."
260149,136767676,151420,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and we'll conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in earnings release issued earlier today. Turning to S",1928,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and we'll conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in earnings release issued earlier today. Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the second quarter and then I'll discuss the second quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $245 million of pretax expenses or about $0.26 per share related to integration, severance and retention costs associated with the Qwest integration. Second, we incurred about $25 million in pretax integration and severance costs or about $0.03 per share related to the Embarq acquisition, and $2 million in pretax transaction and integration cost related to the Savvis transaction.
These special items were offset by favorable settlement of an operating tax issue of $12 million or $0.01 a share. Non-operating items include risk facility costs, net of interest on the settlement of an operating tax issue and the tax benefit from reduction of an NOL valuation allowance, which together, accounted for about $0.01 of share as well. In the aggregate, these items represented $0.27 per share difference and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.44 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17.
Now turning to Slide 13, this slide reflects CenturyLink's results for the second quarter 2011 compared to pro forma second quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide includes Qwest results for second quarter 2011 and pro forma second quarter 2010 as if the Qwest merger occurred as of January 1, 2010. The final column titled actual 2010 does not include the Qwest's results and really includes the as reported results.
For second quarter 2011, operating revenues decreased to $4.4 billion from $4.6 billion in pro forma second quarter a year ago. The decrease in revenue resulted primarily due to growth in strategic revenues, driven by growth in HSI, high-speed Internet customers, and data services, and transport demands being more than offset by a decrease in legacy revenues due to continued access line losses and lower access revenues. Cash operating expenses decreased from $2.6 billion in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense was virtually flat from $1,195,000,000 in pro forma second quarter a year ago to $1,198,000,000 in the second quarter of 2011. These figures included the noncash impact of business combination accounting from assigning the fair value to Qwest properties, including the customer list in both periods.
Net income for the quarter was $262 million compared to $302 million in pro forma second quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.44 in the second quarter 2011 and $0.51 in the pro forma second quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of higher than anticipated depreciation and amortization expense associated with the preliminary assignment of fair value and depreciable life to Qwest property and intangible assets, again primarily the customer base, second quarter 2011 earnings per share would have been $0.64.
Our free cash flow increased from $876 million in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $950 million in the second quarter of 2011, so an increase in free cash flow from quarter-to-quarter. Our free cash flow definition is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding special items, less capital expenditures. In addition, there is one item I'd like to point you to in the actual 2010 results compared with the second quarter 2011 results. Basically, regarding our operating cash flow, as it more than doubled in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in a 4.6% increase in operating cash flow per share to $3.20 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Glen mentioned earlier, turning to Slide 14, we now report 3 operating segments. In total, the regional operating market revenues declined $117 million or 4.9%. The strategic revenue grew $40 million or 5.8% from pro forma second quarter 2010, driven mainly by high-speed Internet customer adds, as well as growth in other revenue. Legacy revenue declined $150 million or 9.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010 as access line losses continued to impact local and long-distance revenues. Our data integration revenues declined $7 million or 17.5% resulting from lower CPE sales. Segment expenses declined $40 million or 3.9% year-over-year primarily driven by reductions in employee costs, as well as marketing expenses.
Turning to Slide 15, Business Markets Group. Overall, BMG revenues declined $39 million or 4.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010. In the second quarter 2011, strategic revenues represented almost 48% of BMG revenues and grew by $13 million or 3% to $442 million on the strong MPLS unit growth that Glen referenced earlier. The strategic revenue increase was offset by legacy revenue decline from second quarter 2010 by $25 million or 6.5% to $362 million, driven by declines in local revenue. Data integration revenues decreased $27 million or 18.6% to $118 million primarily resulting from lower CPE sales. Our total segment expenses in BMG declined $30 million or 5.2% to $551 million from second quarter 2010, driven mainly by lower employee costs and lower CPE sales.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall, wholesale revenues declined $47 million from pro forma second quarter 2010 or 4.6%. Strategic revenue grew $45 million which is 8.7%, primarily driven by special access and private line transport resulting from increased sales of DS1s, DS3s, and ethernet and fiber to the tower. Our strategic revenue represented almost 58% of total wholesale revenues in the second quarter 2011, up from 51% in pro forma second quarter 2010. Legacy revenue declined $92 million or 18.2%, driven by access and long-distance declines, primarily resulting from competition, products substitution and lower minutes of use. As expected, we also lost a few database customers that contributed to the decline as well.
Wholesale segment expense declined $6 million or about 2%, mainly driven by lower employee costs, and access volumes and rate declines.
On Slide 17, I'll briefly review Savvis's results from the second quarter. Savvis generated revenue of $264 million, a 19% increase from the same quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strong managed services growth across key verticals of Consumer brands, financial and media. Their operating cash flow, excluding special items, grew 31% from $48 million in the second quarter a year ago to $63 million in second quarter 2011. The operating cash flow margin, excluding special items, improved to 23.9% this quarter, which is actually 27%, excluding noncash comp from 21.6% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 17, 18. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, as well as the Savvis acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, changes in regulations and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Please note 2011 full year guidance, the first column in the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011, combined with CenturyLink and Qwest results for second quarter 2011, and combined CenturyLink, Qwest and Savvis for the remainder of the year. 
For full year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and diluted EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Our capital expenditures will be between $2.35 billion and $2.5 billion, and free cash flow of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion.
For third quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.34, and free cash flow of $1.88 billion to $1.92 billion. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter diluted EPS to be within the similar $0.29 to $0.34 range as a reduction in seasonal expenses should offset revenue declines.
The sequential decline in diluted EPS expected in the third quarter is primarily due to a decline in and access revenues, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue, and again, seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance, which we experience every year. Please note that on this slide, the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if Qwest and Savvis mergers were effective as of January 1, 2011, and the company operated on a combined basis for the full year 2011. We expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be approximately 50% of free cash flow, assuming on a pro forma basis.
I want to do one thing for you and that's reconcile the previous guidance that we gave, a couple of items that we gave related to previous guidance compared with current guidance on the pro forma 2011 amounts. Our previous guidance for pro forma operating revenues and this basically included a full year of CenturyLink, as well as Qwest, but excluded Savvis, was $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion. Our current guidance has increased to $18.5 billion to $18.8 billion of revenue. That guidance, however, includes Savvis. So Savvis is a little bit over $1 billion of the increase, partially offset by about a $90 million decline in CPE that we expect currently, as well as other revenue declines of approximately $60 million. And those are primarily in local rate changes that we made through the inbound business and certain other items.
Also, to reconcile our pro forma diluted earnings per share to previous guidance, again, including CenturyLink and Qwest on a pro forma basis for full year 2011, was $2.55 to $2.65. Our current guidance is reduced to $1.50 to $1.60. Basically, to reconcile the difference, about $0.78 of this is related to the purchase price of amortization or customer list amortization that we discussed earlier related to the Qwest transaction, about $0.20 of the decline is related to the Savvis acquisition, which basically the entire $0.20 there is related to noncash items, depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of their customer base. About $0.03 decline related to CPE, net of the revenue, net of the expected cost of CPE typically in the margin that we experienced there. And then the other revenue declines are about $0.06 a share. So that kind of gets you from the midpoint of our previous guidance of $2.62 a share to the midpoint of our current guidance of $1.55 a share.
Turning to Slide 19. In the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined companies financial results for third quarter of '11 and full year 2011. Again, all of these items are noncash. And please see the earnings release and related 10-Q filing that we'll make this week for further information. Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we've stated, the board will consider the use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize the expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merger integration of Qwest and Savvis. We've also indicated that maintaining investment grade credit metrics is important to us, and accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012, we will reduce debt by between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And I might add that on a pro forma basis, we reduced debt about $700 million this year, excluding the $2 billion that we borrowed associated with the Savvis transaction.
This concludes our prepared remarks for the day. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

So I guess, I mean, obviously, the stock came off pretty hard today because of the similar uncertainty around the trying to sort out what was Savvis and what was core business changes and what was going incrementally right. But I guess, so is the take away here that we're adding about $1 billion of Savvis revenue, that's a little conservative relative to what the street was expecting for them to deliver for the year. If you could comment on whether there are eliminations in that and whether you're just trying to maybe take a swag you're being more conservative? Number 1. And then number 2, it sounds like if you look at these earnings per share impacts, it looks like you're taking about $50 million of kind of EBITDA out of the old guidance for lower CPE sales and some new contracts. But at the same time, you're not really adding anything back for any potential improvement in integration for Savvis relative to that $275 million EBITDA number which looks very much in line with the street. So could you kind of reconcile some of the conservatism that you seem to be baking into the Savvis outlook and your kind of underlying estimates for the core business and kind of how we should think about whether is this business getting better or is this business getting worse? Because I think that's what is the market is trying to figure it out relative to what you told us last quarter."

So in Savvis, our intent here is to really take down their guidance from what they previously given or from kind of where the street is on a consensus basis. We do have about $1 million a month of revenue that will go away with respect to Savvis from adjustments related to revenue that they have deferred. Probably 75% to 80% of that also is deferred expense that will go away as well and there are some minor eliminations between CenturyLink and Savvis that'll occur, but nothing really significant. So really, if you look at Savvis, I mean, again, we're not really their previous guidance was $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 of revenue and we really feel very, very comfortable with the range impact really kind of the upper end of that range. Also, with respect to their EBITDA margins, if you exclude the noncash comp that they exclude and get to their adjusted EBITDA that they talked about previously, they were about 27% in the second quarter, which is about where they expected to be. So they really had a good quarter. Their bookings were good. Their backlog of bookings continues to be strong and does not include any positive impact that we may get from the combination associated with any cross sell opportunities, we've not built any of that in. So that should pretty well cover Savvis. In terms of -- why don't you reiterate the part of the question I haven't answered now and I'll see if we can get. . ."

And the CPE declines will be from a revenue standpoint, about $90 million, which equates to about a $0.03 a share in EPS. The reason it's down is associated with 2 things. One, sales to the government agencies has been down, which basically we think is probably attributable to the budget issues that the government's been going through. Other CPE sales, we seem to be having as many sales as we've had in the past. However, those sales seem to be at lower average amounts. So the sales folks are still selling CPE. There are still selling about the same number of transactions that they had a year ago. It's just the transaction sizes are down. The other revenue declines of about $60 million or so, which really equates to, again, about $0.06 a share in EPS, is really just due to, again, some rate changes that we've made through access rates across state access, also to local rate, the local access line losses, as well as minutes of use, primarily minutes of use on the access side. So I guess I'd have to say to sum it up, we're a little bit more, we're coming off the guidance that we gave last quarter slightly on our revenue and EPS, but most of it, most of the revenue side really relates to CPE. Most of the EPS side really relates to kind of the legacy business more or less and legacy revenues."

So but and the changes there basically about a $70 million change, or increased decline rather, the CPE is $30 million of that, and again, that's lower margin revenue and other legacy revenue declines is ab t$40 million of that and that's right above a combination of items.

Regarding IPTV, as I mentioned earlier, we having good results in our markets overall. For competitive reasons, we won't talk too much but I do think we'll be looking to roll, to begin build out in at least 1 Qwest market by year-end, buildout IPTV product, roll out sometime next year and that's kind of our view and again, to a great extent, success based in we'll see success in the CenturyLink markets that we have in the first build out in Qwest, we see synergy success. There is demand in the market. There's no question the markets are going product. We think it competes well with cable actually our customers on our surveyed to it's a better product than what cable has in most cases.

And I guess what we've subsequently found out after getting the pressure and and everyone's going through their process is, it looks that the accounting profession will likely change their process somewhat because we've gone through and listed out a number of transactions that happened over the last 3 or 4 years and the amount allocated to the customer base seems to be increasing from about 10% or so of the purchase price that we used in the Embarq transaction to about 30% to 35% of the purchase price in more recent transactions.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. We delivered solid financial and operational performance for th",1844,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. 
We delivered solid financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2011, including revenue in line with our guidance range, and improved access line trends. Our second quarter 2011 results are significantly impacted by noncash accounting charges resulting from purchase price accounting for the Qwest transaction. These charges significantly impact our net income and earnings per share, depreciation and amortization increases as we amortize the value of size of the Qwest customer base. 
However, it's very important to note that the purchase price accounting adjustments have no impact on the cash close [ph] of the company and also the accounting adjustment should not in any way affect the economics of the Qwest acquisition. We continue to believe the Qwest transaction is a great strategic combination to improve the growth characteristics of our combined company.
Initial Qwest integration efforts are underway and we have now implemented our local operating model in the legacy Qwest markets. Synergy team [ph] in the second quarter is in line with our expectations. This August 9, we expect to launch a CenturyLink brand into Qwest markets. Also, the final Embarq conversion was completed in late July, marking the end of all major integration activities associated with that kind of transaction approximately 25 months following the close. We have a couple of smaller systems conversions left but the vast majority is now done. And we're on track to achieve the target $375 million in annual run rate synergies later this year. Additionally, we're pleased to welcome Savvis to the CenturyLink family following the close of the transaction with them on July 15.
Now moving to Slide 5 in the deck, I'll cover some financial highlights for the quarter. We achieved operating revenues of $4.4 billion for the quarter, hitting the lower end of our guidance range. The strategic revenue grew by 6% and legacy revenue declining 10.5% as compared with pro forma second quarter 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.44 per share, the lower guidance range due to higher than anticipated amortization related to the business combination accounting of the Qwest properties. Excluding this unexpected increase, earnings per share would be $0.64 and in line with our initial guidance range. Excluding the impact of noncash items, our cash flows remain strong as we generated $950 million of free cash flow during the quarter. Strategic revenue growth of $98 million was driven by high-speed Internet, special access and MPLS growth over the past year.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. During the second quarter, we added over 12,000 high-speed Internet customers. Demand in legacy CenturyLink markets is solid and we achieved higher year-over-year inbound sales in legacy Qwest and CenturyLink markets through the second quarter compared to pro forma second quarter 2010. However, the strong inbound performance was offset by higher than anticipated churn of stand-alone high-speed Internet customers in the legacy Qwest markets. We've taken steps through competitive bundles and save hours [ph] to mitigate this churn, which we believe will improve net broadband additions in the coming months.
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.43 million HSI customers, approximately 50.1% penetration of total addressable access lines. As we mentioned on the earnings call last quarter, CenturyLink and Qwest had different methodologies for accounting access lines. The chart on this slide reflects the methodology adjustments to the standardized CenturyLink and Qwest subscriber accounts. On a combined basis, we continue to see improvement in our rate of access line decline, so we continue to focus on new customer acquisition by targeting the non-customer base, as well as enhancing our retention programs. Our second quarter line loss were approximately 300,000, represents an 18.6% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2010 access line loss.
We continue to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments though we are not seeing much incremental business activity in our markets this year.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss from the trailing 12 months to 7.4%, a reduction from a pro forma trailing 12-month line loss of 8.2% in the second quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance in the top 5 Embarq markets, and we have continued to see strong traction in these markets and the improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company. We continue to see solid results in DIRECTV sales and we added more than 14,700 satellite videos subscribers in the second quarter. We ended the quarter at nearly 1.7 million satellite video customers.
Our Prism services are available in a total of 8 markets now and we expect the number of Prism cable households to reach to close to 1 million households by the end of this year. During the second quarter 2011, high-speed Internet product attachment to our Prism service was 91% and voice attachment was 79%. We are pleased with the overall progress we're making with Prism TV service thus far this year and we expect to continue success in the months ahead.
We also see continued success in driving broadband penetration and our success in both satellite, video and Prism TV sales improved Consumer residential per unit by about $2.18 to 4.3% to $53.29 in the second quarter 2011 over the second quarter of 2010. And finally, we launched the Verizon Wireless in the second quarter of this year. We launched first the small businesses earlier in the quarter and the process of a phased rollout to consumers on the CenturyLink side across retail and call centers. We do have access to the full suite of Verizon's services and handsets and look to grow this as an important part of our bundle, along with the VoIP, high-speed Internet and video products.
As previously disclosed in the second quarter, we began a segment reporting for our 3 major operating groups, Regional Markets group, Business Markets Group and Wholesale Markets group. On Slide 7, I'll briefly review some highlights from each of these segments. And later, Stewart will walk you through the financial performance by segment.
Starting with the regional markets group or RMG. We implemented our local operating model organization across the legacy Qwest markets effective April 1 and we are receiving  positive feedback from customers and employees as a result of this implementation. We also -- also, high-speed Internet sales trends were higher. However, we did experience higher than anticipated churn at standalone broadband and the legacy Qwest markets that I mentioned earlier. We have implemented bundle and phase strategies to mitigate this churn and expect to see improvement in the coming months.
RMG strategic data sales, that is Ethernet, DIA, MPLS and voice over IP continued to post strong growth trends. 2011 strategic revenue is up 6.2% year-over-year. Additionally, sales productivity in the small business market improved due to target bundle offerings and response rates were up 16% with our go-to-market sales efforts.
Moving to our second segment, Business Markets Group or BMG. We're encouraged by improving sales trends with average MRR or monthly recurring revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Second quarter 2011 was up 3.2% in the first quarter '11, and this follows the first quarter '11 or the fourth quarter '10 increase of 2.8%. MPLS revenue grew 11% year-over-year and we continue to have success acquiring large multi-location networks in the commercial enterprise space. We are expanding our customer facing sales capacity by adding front line sales professionals across the country. We have also experienced strong performance in retaining existing customers of total contract value renewals in second quarter '11 up, 23% from the first quarter of 2011.
We continue to leverage our expanded access footprint of the new combined company. Also, met through [ph] Ethernet expansion continues. Ethernet Private Line products being seeing strong customer acceptance with our enterprise customers.
  
Turning to Slide 8, a few highlights regarding our Wholesale Markets Group or WMG. We continue to see strong demand from wireless providers to increase bandwidth which continues to drive our fiber to the sale efforts. This wireless bandwidth demand has provided a positive impact on our special access revenues but we do anticipate these revenues to flatten somewhat in the second half of the year, as wireless carriers migrate away from traditional connections since DS1s to fiber-based Ethernet connections. Basically, we will cannibalize some of our specialty access to the cell tower revenue but expect the Ethernet revenue to grow into the future as demand is driven higher by the growing broadband traffic.
Turning to Slide 9. We completed the fifth and final customer billing conversion in late July which included customers in 11 states and now have Embarq customers on retail Embarq customers of CenturyLink systems. We're pleased that we were able to complete the major Embarq integration activities within approximately 25 months following the close. At the short end of the 24- to 36-month integration range we originally anticipated. And we continued to meet our synergy targets and are on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies by year-end 2011.
On the Qwest side, we substantially completed organization designs for the combined company by the end of the second quarter and we remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resources systems, to our SAP platform by year-end.
Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which will continue over a number of months in the Qwest markets. We achieved $70 million in synergies during the second quarter, driven by corporate overhead reduction and network alignment activities and continue to expect to achieve $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies in 2011. And we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of approximately $190 million to $200 million synergy level. We continue to expect to achieve operating expense synergy of $575 million over the next 3 to 5 years, and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million over the next couple of years.
If we turn to Slide 10, we completed the acquisition of Savvis on July 15, and will operate as a separate business unit. It will be headquartered in St. Louis and we believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis's assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in managed hosting cloud computing and colocation businesses. Now the CenturyLink-Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we'll create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. And based on a 25% growth in the hosting business, we expect revenues of approximately $1 billion for 2011 and operating cash flow of approximately $275 million. So overall, the Savvis transaction makes a strong strategic sense and operational sense for our company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for comments on our financial results."
260149,136767676,151758,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in earnings release issued earlier today. Turning to",1927,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in earnings release issued earlier today. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the second quarter and then I'll discuss the second quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $245 million of pretax expenses or about $0.26 per share related to integration, severance and retention cost associated with the Qwest integration. Second, we incurred about $25 million in pretax integration and severance costs or about $0.03 per share related to the Embarq acquisition, and $2 million in pretax transaction and integration cost related to the Savvis transaction.
These special items were offset by favorable settlement of an operating tax issue of $12 million or $0.01 a share. Non-operating items include risk facility costs, net of interest on the settlement of an operating tax issue and the tax benefit from reduction of an NOL valuation allowance, which together, accounted for about $0.01 of share as well. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.27 per share difference and normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.44 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17.
Now turning to Slide 13, this slide reflects CenturyLink's results for the second quarter 2011 compared to pro forma second quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide includes Qwest results for second quarter 2011 and pro forma second quarter 2010 as if the Qwest merger occurred as of January 1, 2010. The final column titled actual 2010 does not include the Qwest's results and really includes the as reported results.
For second quarter 2011, operating revenues decreased to $4.4 billion from $4.6 billion in pro forma second quarter a year ago. The decrease in revenue resulted primarily due to growth in strategic revenues, driven by growth in HSI, high-speed Internet customers, and data services, and transport demands being more than offset by a decrease in legacy revenues due to continued access line losses and lower access revenues. Cash operating expenses decreased from $2.6 billion in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense was virtually flat from $1,195,000,000 in pro forma second quarter a year ago to $1,198,000,000 in the second quarter of 2011. These figures included the noncash impact of business combination accounting from assigning the fair value to Qwest properties, including the customer list in both periods.
Net income for the quarter was $262 million compared to $302 million in pro forma second quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.44 in the second quarter 2011 and $0.51 in the pro forma second quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of higher than anticipated depreciation and amortization expense associated with the preliminary assignment of fair value and depreciable life to Qwest property and intangible assets, again primarily the customer base, second quarter 2011 earnings per share would have been $0.64.
Our free cash flow increased from $876 million in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $950 million in the second quarter of 2011, so an increase in free cash flow from quarter-to-quarter. Our free cash flow definition is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding special items, less capital expenditures. In addition, there is one item I'd like to point you to in the actual 2010 results compared with the second quarter 2011 results. Basically, regarding our operating cash flow, as it more than doubled in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in a 4.6% increase in operating cash flow per share to $3.20 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Glen mentioned earlier, turning to Slide 14, we now report 3 operating segments. In total, regional operating market revenues declined $117 million or 4.9%. The strategic revenue grew $40 million or 5.8% from pro forma second quarter 2010, driven mainly by high-speed Internet customer adds, as well as growth in other revenues. Legacy revenue declined $150 million or 9.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010 as access line losses continued to impact local and long-distance revenues. Our data integration revenues declined $7 million or 17.5% resulting from lower CPE sales. Segment expenses declined $40 million or 3.9% year-over-year primarily driven by reductions in employee costs, as well as marketing expenses.
Turning to Slide 15, Business Markets Group. Overall, BMG revenues declined $39 million or 4.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010. In the second quarter 2011, strategic revenues represented almost 48% of BMG revenues and grew by $13 million or 3% to $442 million on the strong MPLS unit growth that Glen referenced earlier. The strategic revenue increase was offset by legacy revenue decline from second quarter 2010 by $25 million or 6.5% to $362 million, driven by declines in local revenue. Data integration revenues decreased $27 million or 18.6% to $118 million primarily resulting from lower CPE sales. Our total segment expenses in BMG declined $30 million or 5.2% to $551 million from second quarter 2010, driven mainly by lower employee cost and lower CPE sales.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall, wholesale revenues declined $47 million from pro forma second quarter 2010 or 4.6%. Strategic revenue grew $45 million which is 8.7%, primarily driven by special access and private line transport resulting from increased sales of DS1s, DS3s, and Ethernet and fiber to the tower. Our strategic revenue represented almost 58% of total wholesale revenues in the second quarter 2011, up from 51% in pro forma second quarter 2010. Legacy revenue declined $92 million or 18.2%, driven by access and long-distance declines, primarily resulting from competition, products substitution and lower minutes of use. As expected, we also lost a few database customers that contributed to the decline as well.
Wholesale segment expense declined $6 million or about 2%, mainly driven by lower employee costs, and access volumes and rate declines.
On Slide 17, I'll briefly review Savvis's results from the second quarter. Savvis generated revenue of $264 million, a 19% increase from the same quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strong managed services growth across key verticals of Consumer brands, financial and media. Their operating cash flow, excluding special items, grew 31% from $48 million in the second quarter a year ago to $63 million in second quarter 2011. The operating cash flow margin, excluding special items, improved to 23.9% this quarter, which is actually 27%, excluding noncash comp from 21.6% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 17, 18. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, as well as the Savvis acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans, changes in regulation, any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Please note 2011 full year guidance, the first column in the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011, combined with CenturyLink and Qwest results for second quarter 2011, and combined CenturyLink, Qwest and Savvis for the remainder of the year. 
For full year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and diluted EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Our capital expenditures will be between $2.35 billion and $2.5 billion, and free cash flow of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion.
For third quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.34, and free cash flow of $1.88 billion to $1.92 billion. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter diluted EPS to be within the similar $0.29 to $0.34 range as a reduction in seasonal expenses should offset revenue declines.
The sequential decline in diluted EPS expected in the third quarter is primarily due to a decline in VoIP and access revenues, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and, again, seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance, which we experience every year. Please note that on this slide, the second column entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if Qwest and Savvis mergers were effective as of January 1, 2011, and the company operated on a combined basis for the full year 2011. We expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be approximately 50% of free cash flow, assuming on a pro forma basis.
I want to do one thing for you and that's reconcile the previous guidance that we gave, a couple of items that we gave related to previous guidance compared with current guidance on the pro forma 2011 amounts. Our previous guidance for pro forma operating revenues, and this basically included a full year of CenturyLink, as well as Qwest, but excluded Savvis, was $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion. Our current guidance has increased to $18.5 billion to $18.8 billion of revenue. That guidance, however, includes Savvis. So Savvis is a little bit over $1 billion of the increase, partially offset by about a $90 million decline in CPE that we expect currently, as well as other revenue declines of approximately $60 million. And those are primarily in local rate changes that we made through the in-bank business and certain other items.
Also, to reconcile our pro forma diluted earnings per share to previous guidance, again, including CenturyLink and Qwest on a pro forma basis for full year 2011, was $2.55 to $2.65. Our current guidance is reduced to $1.50 to $1.60. Basically, to reconcile the difference, about $0.78 of this is related to the purchase price amortization or customer list amortization that we discussed earlier related to the Qwest transaction, about $0.20 of the decline is related to the Savvis acquisition, which basically the entire $0.20 there is related to noncash items, depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of their customer base. About $0.03 decline related to CPE, net of the revenue, net of the expected cost of CPE typically in the margin that we experienced there. And then the other revenue declines are about $0.06 a share. So that kind of gets you from the midpoint of our previous guidance of $2.62 a share to the midpoint of our current guidance of $1.55 a share.
Turning to Slide 19. In the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined companies' financial results for third quarter of '11 and full year 2011. Again, all of these items are noncash. And please see the earnings release and related 10-Q filing that we'll make this week for further information. Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we've stated, the board will consider the use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize the expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merger integration of Qwest and Savvis. We've also indicated that maintaining investment grade credit metrics is important to us, and accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012, we will reduce debt by between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And I might add that on a pro forma basis, we reduced debt about $700 million this year, excluding the $2 billion that we borrowed associated with the Savvis transaction.

But I guess, so is the take away here that we're adding about $1 billion of Savvis revenue, that's a little conservative relative to what the street was expecting for them to deliver for the year. If you could comment on whether there are eliminations in that and whether you're just trying to maybe take a swag you're being more conservative on that to be, number 1. And then number 2, it sounds like if I look at these earnings per share impacts, it looks like you're taking about $50 million of kind of EBITDA out of the old guidance for lower CPE sales and some new contracts. But at the same time, you're not really adding anything back for any potential improvement in integration for Savvis relative to that $275 million EBITDA number which looks very much in line with the street. So could you kind of reconcile some of the conservatism that you seem to be baking into the Savvis outlook and your kind of underlying estimates for the core business and kind of how we should think about whether is this business getting better or is this business getting worse? Because I think that's what is the market is trying to figure it out relative to what you told us last quarter."

So in Savvis, our intent here in [indiscernible] is to really take down their guidance from what they previously given or from kind of where the street",278,"So David, let me take a shot at it and come back with a question that if I don't completely answer you. So in Savvis, our intent here in [indiscernible] is to really take down their guidance from what they previously given or from kind of where the street is on a consensus basis. We do have about $1 million a month of revenue that will go away with respect to Savvis from adjustments related to revenue that they have deferred. Probably 75% to 80% of that also is deferred expense that will go away as well and there are some minor eliminations between CenturyLink and Savvis that'll occur, but nothing really significant. So really, if you look at Savvis, I mean, again, we're not really -- their previous guidance was $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 of revenue and we really feel very, very comfortable with the range impact really kind of the upper end of that range. Also, with respect to their EBITDA margins, if you exclude the noncash comp that they exclude and get to their adjusted EBITDA that they talked about previously, they were about 27% in the second quarter, which is about where they expected to be. So they really had a good quarter. Their bookings were good. Their backlog of bookings continues to be strong and that does not include any positive impact that we may get from the combination associated with any cross-sell opportunities. We've not built any of that in. So that should pretty well cover Savvis. In terms of -- why don't you reiterate the part of the question I haven't answered now and I'll see if we can get. . ."

And the CPE declines will be from a revenue standpoint, about $90 million, which equates to about a $0.03 a share in EPS. The reason it's down is associated with 2 things. One, sales to the government agencies has been down, which basically, we think, is probably attributable to the budget issues that the government's been going through. Other CPE sales, we seem to be having as many sales as we've had in the past. However, those sales seem to be at lower average amounts. So the sales folks are still selling CPE. They're are still selling about the same number of transactions that they had a year ago. It's just the transaction sizes are down. The other revenue declines of about $60 million or so, which really equates to, again, about $0.06 a share in EPS, is really just due to, again, some rate changes that we've made through access rates across state access, also to the local rate, the local access line losses, as well as minutes of use, primarily minutes of use on the access side. So I guess I'd have to say to sum it up, we're a little bit more, we're coming off the guidance that we gave last quarter slightly on our revenue and EPS, but most of it, most of the revenue side really relates to CPE. Most of the EPS side really relates to kind of the legacy business more or less and legacy revenues."

And the reason, one of the reasons we decided to give operating cash flow guidance is because we think that on a longer-term basis, it'll be easier for you guys to track that and it doesn't vary because like free cash flow does because of changes in capital expenses, expenditures from quarter-to-quarter and things that.

So but and the changes there basically about a $70 million change, or increased decline rather, the CPE is $30 million of that, and again, that's lower margin revenue and other legacy revenue declines is about $40 million of that.

So about $7.5 billion was allocated to the customer relationships. And again, we hope to have this finalized pretty much by the end of the third quarter. But we have, I guess, until sometime next year to get it finalized. But we're working with the appraiser to try to get it final. We felt like we had better information than we did at the end of first quarter when we originally gave our guidance on this.

We see opportunities there to add capacity that could generate revenue opportunities or us. So a little more aggressive there in a few markets where we've built up, partial build-out, haven't finished build out in some markets. So I think we'll be looking at additional capacity opportunities there, for sliding, a little bit -- talking about the $50 million increase that's still there of what Savvis was -- will bring to the table. Regarding IPTV, as I mentioned earlier, we're having good results in our markets overall. For competitive reasons, we won't talk, say too much about what we're doing but I do think we'll be looking to roll, to begin build out in at least 1 Qwest market by year-end, buildout IPTV products, roll out sometime next year. So that's kind of our view and, again, willingness. So to a great extent, like success base, we think we'll see success in the CenturyLink markets that we have in the first build out of the Qwest, we see synergy success. There is demand in the market. There's no question. There's demand for this product in the market. It's a quality product. We think it competes well with cable. Actually our customers on our survey said it's a better product than what cable has in most cases. So we're confident it's just a matter of significant situations plant conditions, loop shortening opportunities as far as the economics of building out in the Qwest markets."

Is it looks like the accounting professions will actually change their process somewhat because if you -- we've gone through and listed out a number of transactions that have happened over the last 3 or 4 years and the amount allocated to the customer base seems to be increasing from about 10% or so of the purchase price that we used in the Embarq transaction to about 30% to 35% of the purchase price in more recent transactions.

Again, the indication is that they've sold about the same number as they have in the past, but the average size of each transaction seems to be smaller than they experienced last year.

We delivered solid financial and operational performance for th",1842,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2011 operating results, as well as selected operational updates and 2011 guidance information. 
We delivered solid financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2011, including revenue in line with our guidance range and improved access line trends. Our second quarter 2011 results are significantly impacted by noncash accounting charges resulting from purchase price accounting for the Qwest transaction. These charges significantly impact our net income and earnings per share as depreciation and amortization increases as we amortize the value assigned to the Qwest customer base. 
However, it's very important to note that the purchase price accounting adjustments have no impact on the cash flows of the company, and also the accounting adjustment should not in any way affect the economics of the Qwest acquisition. We continue to believe the Qwest transaction is a great strategic combination to improve the growth characteristics of our combined company.
Initial Qwest integration efforts are underway, and we have now implemented our local operating model in the legacy Qwest markets. Synergy achievement in the second quarter is in line with our expectations. Additionally, on August 9, we expect to launch a CenturyLink brand into Qwest markets. Also, the final Embarq conversion was completed in late July, marking the end of all major integration activities associated with that transaction approximately 25 months following the close. We have a couple of smaller systems conversions left, but the vast majority is now done. And we're on track to achieve the targeted $375 million in annual run rate synergies later this year. Additionally, we're pleased to welcome Savvis to the CenturyLink family following the close of the transaction with them on July 15.
Now moving to Slide 5 in the deck, I'll cover some financial highlights for the quarter. We achieved operating revenues of $4.4 billion for the quarter, hitting the lower end of our guidance range. The strategic revenue growing by 6% and legacy revenue declining 10.5% as compared with pro forma second quarter 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.44 per share, below our guidance range due to higher than anticipated amortization related to the business combination accounting of the Qwest properties. Excluding this unexpected increase, earnings per share would be $0.64 and in line with our initial guidance range. Excluding the impact of noncash items, our cash flows remain strong as we generated $950 million of free cash flow during the quarter. Strategic revenue growth of $98 million was driven by high-speed Internet, special access and MPLS growth over the past year.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to cover a few operating highlights for the quarter. During the second quarter, we added over 12,000 high-speed Internet customers. Demand in legacy CenturyLink markets is solid, and we achieved higher year-over-year inbound sales in the legacy Qwest and CenturyLink markets during the second quarter compared to pro forma second quarter 2010. However, the strong inbound performance was offset by higher than anticipated churn of stand-alone high-speed Internet customers in the legacy Qwest markets. We've taken steps through competitive bundles and save offers to mitigate this churn, which we believe will improve net broadband additions in the coming months.
We ended the quarter with approximately 5.43 million HSI customers, approximately 50.1% penetration of total addressable access lines. As we mentioned on the earnings call last quarter, CenturyLink and Qwest had different methodologies for accounting access lines. The chart on this slide reflects the methodology adjustments to standardized CenturyLink and Qwest subscriber accounts. On a combined basis, we continue to see improvement in our rate of access line decline, so we continue to focus on new customer acquisition by targeting the non-customer base, as well as enhancing our retention programs. Our second quarter line loss of approximately 300,000 represents an 18.6% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2010 access line loss.
We continue to see a decline in disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments though we are not seeing much incremental business activity in our markets this year.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months to 7.4%, a reduction from a pro forma trailing 12-month line loss of 8.2% in the second quarter of 2010. One of the keys to this ongoing improvement in customer loss has been the performance in the top 5 Embarq markets, and we have continued to see strong traction in these markets, and improvement continues to outpace the rest of the company. We continue to see solid results in DIRECTV sales, and we added more than 14,700 satellite videos subscribers in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with nearly 1.7 million satellite video customers.
Our Prism services are available in a total of 8 markets now, and we expect the number of Prism-capable households to pass -- to reach to close to 1 million households by the end of this year. During the second quarter 2011, high-speed Internet product attachment to our Prism service was 91%, and voice attachment was 79%. We are pleased with the overall progress we're making with Prism TV service thus far this year, and we expect continued success in the months ahead.
We also see continued success in driving broadband penetration, and our success in both satellite, video and Prism TV sales improved Consumer residential [indiscernible] per unit by about $2.18 at 4.3% to $53.29 in the second quarter 2011 over the second quarter of 2010. And finally, we launched the Verizon Wireless in the second quarter of this year. We launched first the small businesses earlier in the quarter and the process of our phased rollout to consumers on the CenturyLink side across retail and call centers. We do have access to the full suite of Verizon's services and handsets and look to grow this as an important part of our bundle, along with the voice, high-speed Internet and video products.
As previously disclosed during the second quarter, we began a segment reporting for our 3 major operating groups, Regional Markets group, Business Markets Group and Wholesale Markets group. On Slide 7, I'll briefly review some highlights from each of these segments. And later, Stewart will walk you through the financial performance by segment.
Starting with the Regional Markets Group or RMG. We implemented our local operating model organization across the legacy Qwest markets effective April 1, and we are receiving positive feedback from customers and employees as a result of this implementation. We also -- also, high-speed Internet sales trends were higher. However, we did experience higher than anticipated churn at standalone broadband and the legacy Qwest markets that I mentioned earlier. We have implemented bundle and phase strategies to mitigate this churn and expect to see improvement in the coming months.
RMG strategic data sales, that is Ethernet, DIA, MPLS and voice over IP continued to post strong growth trends. 2011 strategic revenue is up 6.2% year-over-year. Additionally, sales productivity in the small business market improved due to target bundle offerings, and response rates were up 16% with our new go-to-market sales efforts.
Moving to our second segment, Business Markets Group or BMG. We're encouraged by improving sales trends with average MRR or monthly recurring revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Second quarter 2011 was up 3.2% from first quarter '11, and this follows the first quarter '11 over fourth quarter '10 increase of 2.8%. MPLS revenue grew 11% year-over-year, and we continue to have success acquiring large multi-location networks in the commercial enterprise space. We are expanding our customer facing sales capacity by adding front line sales professionals across the country. We have also experienced strong performance in retaining existing customers of total contract value renewals in second quarter '11, up 23% from the first quarter of 2011.
We continue to leverage our expanded access footprint of the new combined company. Also, Metro Ethernet expansion continues, an Ethernet Private Line product that’s seeing strong customer acceptance with our enterprise customers.
  
Turning to Slide 8, a few highlights regarding our Wholesale Markets Group or WMG. We continue to see strong demand from wireless providers for increased bandwidth which continues to drive our fiber-to-the-cell efforts. This wireless bandwidth demand has provided a positive impact on our special access revenues, but we do anticipate these revenues to flatten somewhat in the second half of the year, as wireless carriers migrate away from traditional connections since DS1s to fiber-based Ethernet connections. Basically, we will cannibalize some of our special access to the cell tower revenue but expect the Ethernet revenue to grow into the future as demand is driven higher by the growing broadband traffic.
Turning to Slide 9. We completed the fifth and final customer billing conversion in late July which included customers in 11 states and now have Embarq customers on -- retail Embarq customers on CenturyLink systems. We're pleased that we were able to complete the major Embarq integration activities within approximately 25 months following the close at the short end of the 24- to 36-month integration range we originally anticipated. And we continued to meet our synergy targets and are on track to achieve our expected $375 million in operating expense synergies by year-end 2011.
On the Qwest side, we substantially completed the organization designs for the combined company by the end of the second quarter, and we remain on track to complete the conversion of Qwest financial and human resources systems to our SAP platform by year-end. 
Additionally, network grooming activities are underway which will continue over a number of months in the Qwest markets. We achieved $70 million in synergies during the second quarter, driven by corporate overhead reduction and network alignment activities and continue to expect to achieve $80 million to $100 million in operating expense synergies in 2011. And we expect to exit 2011 at an annual run rate of approximately $190 million to $200 million synergy level. We continue to expect to achieve operating expense synergies of $575 million over the next 3 to 5 years and capital expenditures synergies of $50 million over the next couple of years.
If we turn to Slide 10, we completed the acquisition of Savvis on July 15. It will operate as a separate business unit. It will be headquartered in St. Louis, and we believe the combination of CenturyLink's network and hosting assets with Savvis' assets will provide an exciting new platform that will enable us to capture growth in managed hosting cloud computing and colocation businesses. Now the CenturyLink-Savvis combination really is about growth. Together, we'll create a premier -- we do create a premier managed hosting and cloud provider with global scale. And based on 25% growth in the hosting business, we expect revenues of approximately $1 billion for 2011 and operating cash flow of approximately $275 million. So overall, the Savvis transaction makes strong strategic sense and operational sense for our company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart for comments on our financial results."

During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today. Turning",1934,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some of the highlights of our second quarter 2011 operating results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of 2011 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to begin by reviewing with you a couple of special items that occurred during the second quarter, and then I'll discuss the second quarter normalized results. First, we incurred approximately $245 million of pretax expenses or about $0.26 per share related to integration, severance and retention cost associated with the Qwest integration. Second, we incurred about $25 million in pretax integration and severance costs or about $0.03 per share related to the Embarq acquisition and $2 million in pretax transaction and integration cost related to the Savvis transaction.
These special items were offset by favorable settlement of an operating tax issue of $12 million or $0.01 a share. Non-operating items include Bruce facility costs, net of interest on the settlement of an operating tax issue and the tax benefit from reduction of an NOL valuation allowance, which together, accounted for about $0.01 of share as well. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.27 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.44 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17.
Now turning to Slide 13. This slide reflects CenturyLink's results for the second quarter 2011 compared to pro forma second quarter 2010, excluding special items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. Please note that the information on this slide includes Qwest results for second quarter 2011 and pro forma second quarter 2010 as if the Qwest merger occurred as of January 1, 2010. The final column titled actual 2010 does not include the Qwest results and really includes the as-reported results.
For second quarter 2011, operating revenues decreased to $4.4 billion from $4.6 billion in pro forma second quarter a year ago. The decrease in revenue resulted primarily due to growth in strategic revenues, driven by growth in HSI, high-speed Internet customers, and data services and transport demands, being more than offset by a decrease in legacy revenues due to continued access line losses and lower access revenues. Cash operating expenses decreased from $2.6 billion in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense was virtually flat from $1,195,000,000 in pro forma second quarter a year ago to $1,198,000,000 in the second quarter of 2011. These figures included the noncash impact of business combination accounting from assigning the fair value to Qwest properties, including the customer list in both periods.
Net income for the quarter was $262 million compared to $302 million in pro forma second quarter a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $0.44 in the second quarter 2011 and $0.51 in the pro forma second quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of higher than anticipated depreciation and amortization expense associated with the preliminary assignment of fair value and depreciable life to Qwest property and intangible assets, again primarily the customer base, second quarter 2011 earnings per share would have been $0.64.
Our free cash flow increased from $876 million in pro forma second quarter 2010 to $950 million in the second quarter of 2011, so an increase in free cash flow from quarter-to-quarter. Our free cash flow definition is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding special items, less capital expenditures. In addition, there is one item I'd like to point you to in the actual 2010 results compared with the second quarter 2011 results, basically, regarding our operating cash flow, as it more than doubled in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in a 4.6% increase in operating cash flow per share to $3.20 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Glen mentioned earlier, turning to Slide 14, we now report 3 operating segments. In total, regional operating market revenues declined $117 million or 4.9%. The strategic revenue grew $40 million or 5.8% from pro forma second quarter 2010, driven mainly by high-speed Internet customer adds, as well as growth in other revenues. Legacy revenue declined $150 million or 9.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010 as access line losses continued to impact local and long-distance revenues. Our data integration revenues declined $7 million or 17.5% resulting from lower CPE sales. Segment expenses declined $40 million or 3.9% year-over-year, primarily driven by reductions in employee costs, as well as marketing expenses.
Turning to Slide 15, Business Markets Group. Overall, BMG revenues declined $39 million or 4.1% from pro forma second quarter 2010. In the second quarter 2011, strategic revenues represented almost 48% of BMG revenues and grew by $13 million or 3% to $442 million on the strong MPLS unit growth that Glen referenced earlier. The strategic revenue increase was offset by legacy revenue decline from second quarter 2010 by $25 million or 6.5% to $362 million, driven by declines in local revenue. Data integration revenues decreased $27 million or 18.6% to $118 million primarily resulting from lower CPE sales. Our total segment expenses in BMG declined $30 million or 5.2% to $551 million from second quarter 2010, driven mainly by lower employee cost and lower CPE sales.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall, wholesale revenues declined $47 million from pro forma second quarter 2010 or 4.6%. Strategic revenue grew $45 million which is 8.7%, primarily driven by special access and private line transport resulting from increased sales of DS1s, DS3s, and Ethernet and fiber to the tower. Our strategic revenue represented almost 58% of total wholesale revenues in the second quarter of 2011, up from 51% in pro forma second quarter 2010. Legacy revenue declined $92 million or 18.2%, driven by access and long-distance declines, primarily resulting from competition, product substitution and lower minutes of use. As expected, we also lost a few database customers that contributed to the decline as well.
Wholesale segment expense declined $6 million or about 2%, mainly driven by lower employee costs, and access volumes and rate declines.
On Slide 17, I'll briefly review Savvis's results from the second quarter. Savvis generated revenue of $264 million, a 19% increase from the same quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strong managed services growth across key verticals of Consumer brands, financial and media. Their operating cash flow, excluding special items, grew 31% from $48 million in the second quarter a year ago to $63 million in second quarter 2011. The operating cash flow margin, excluding special items, improved to 23.9% this quarter, which is actually 27%, excluding noncash comp, from 21.6% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 17 -- 18. Our 2011 guidance excludes the effects of nonrecurring items; integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition; transaction and integration expenses associated with the Qwest acquisition, as well as the Savvis acquisition; any changes in operating or capital plans; changes in regulation; and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Please note 2011 full year guidance, the first column in the slide, reflects only CenturyLink results for first quarter 2011, combined with CenturyLink and Qwest results for second quarter 2011, and combined CenturyLink, Qwest and Savvis for the remainder of the year. 
For full year 2011, CenturyLink expects operating revenues to be $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and diluted EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Our capital expenditures will be between $2.35 billion and $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion.
For third quarter 2011, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.34 and free cash flow of $1.88 billion to $1.92 billion. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter diluted EPS to be within a similar $0.29 to $0.34 range as a reduction in seasonal expenses should offset revenue declines.
The sequential decline in diluted EPS expected in the third quarter is primarily due to a decline in voice and access revenues, partially offset by an increase in high-speed Internet revenue and, again, seasonal increase in outside plant maintenance, which we experience every year. Please note that on this slide, the second column, entitled pro forma 2011, provides guidance as if Qwest and Savvis mergers were effective as of January 1, 2011, and the company operated on a combined basis for the full year 2011. We expect that our dividend payout ratio in 2011 will be approximately 50% of free cash flow, assuming on a pro forma basis.
I want to do one thing for you and that's reconcile the previous guidance that we gave -- a couple of items that we gave related to previous guidance compared with current guidance on the pro forma 2011 amounts. Our previous guidance for pro forma operating revenues, and this basically included a full year of CenturyLink, as well as Qwest, but excluded Savvis, was $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion. Our current guidance has increased to $18.5 billion to $18.8 billion of revenue. That guidance, however, includes Savvis. So Savvis is a little bit over $1 billion of the increase, partially offset by about a $90 million decline in CPE that we expect currently, as well as other revenue declines of approximately $60 million. And those are primarily in local rate changes that we made in the inmate business and certain other items.
Also, to reconcile our pro forma diluted earnings per share to previous guidance, again, including CenturyLink and Qwest on a pro forma basis for full year 2011, was $2.55 to $2.65. Our current guidance is reduced to $1.50 to $1.60. Basically, to reconcile the difference, about $0.78 of this is related to the purchase price amortization or customer list amortization that we discussed earlier related to the Qwest transaction. About $0.20 of the decline is related to the Savvis acquisition, which basically the entire $0.20 there is related to noncash items, depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of their customer base. About $0.03 decline related to CPE, net of the revenue, net of the expected cost of CPE typically and the margin that we experienced there. And then the other revenue declines are about $0.06 a share. So that kind of gets you down -- gets you from the midpoint of our previous guidance of $2.62 a share to the midpoint of our current guidance of $1.55 a share.
Turning to Slide 19. In the earnings release today, we included estimated impacts that the application of business combination accounting rules are expected to have on the combined companies' financial results for third quarter '11 and full year 2011. Again, all of these items are noncash. And please see the earnings release and related 10-Q filing that we'll make this week for further information. Regarding the capital structure and use of free cash flow, as we've stated, the board will consider the use of free cash flow next year as we more fully realize the expected merger synergies and see further progress with the merger integration of Qwest and Savvis. We've also indicated that maintaining investment grade credit metrics is important to us, and accordingly, we expect that during 2011 and 2012, we will reduce debt by between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And I might add that on a pro forma basis, we reduced debt about $700 million this year, excluding the $2 billion that we borrowed associated with the Savvis transaction.
This concludes our prepared remarks for the day. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

But I guess -- so is the take away here that we're adding about $1 billion of Savvis revenue, that's a little conservative relative to what the Street was expecting for them to deliver for the year. If you could comment on whether there are eliminations in that and whether you're just trying to maybe take a swag at being more conservative on that. That’d be number one. And then number 2, it sounds like if I look at these earnings per share impacts, it looks like you're taking about $50 million of kind of EBITDA out of the old guidance for lower CPE sales and some new contracts. But at the same time, you're not really adding anything back for any potential improvement in integration for Savvis relative to that $275 million EBITDA number which looks very much in line with the Street. So could you kind of reconcile some of the conservatism that you seem to be baking into the Savvis outlook and your kind of underlying estimates for the core business and kind of how we should think about whether -- is this business getting better or is this business getting worse? Because I think that's what the market is trying to figure it out relative to what you told us last quarter."

So in Savvis, our intent here in no way is to really take down their guidance from what they had previously given or from kind of where the street is on a consensus basis. We do have about $1 million a month of revenue that will go away with respect to Savvis from adjustments related to revenue that they have deferred. Probably 75% to 80% of that also is deferred expense that will go away as well, and there are some minor eliminations between CenturyLink and Savvis that'll occur, but nothing really significant. So really, if you look at Savvis, I mean, again, we're not really -- their previous guidance was $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 of revenue, and we really feel very, very comfortable with the range, in fact, really kind of the upper end of that range. Also, with respect to their EBITDA margins, they were -- if you exclude the noncash comp that they exclude and get to their adjusted EBITDA that David [ph] talked about previously, they were about 27% in the second quarter, which is about where they expected to be. So they really had a good quarter. Their bookings were good. Their backlog of bookings continues to be strong, and that does not include any positive impact that we may get from the combination associated with any cross-sell opportunities. We've not built any of that in. So that should pretty well cover Savvis. In terms of -- why don't you reiterate the part of the question I haven't answered now, and I'll see if we can get…"

And the CPE declines will be from a revenue standpoint, about $90 million, which equates to about a $0.03 a share in EPS. The reason it's down is associated with 2 things. One, the government sales -- sales to the government agencies has been down, which basically, we think, is probably attributable to the budget issues that the government's been going through. Other CPE sales, we seem to be having as many sales as we've had in the past. However, those sales seem to be at lower average amounts. So the sales folks are still selling CPE. They're still selling about the same number of transactions that they had a year ago. It's just that the transaction sizes are down. The other revenue declines of about $60 million or so, which really equates to, again, about $0.06 a share in EPS, is really just due to, again, some rate changes that we've made to access rates, intrastate access, also to the local rate, the local access line losses, as well as minutes of use, primarily minutes of use on the access side. So I guess I'd have to say to sum it up, we're a little bit more -- we're coming off the guidance that we gave last quarter slightly on our revenue and EPS, but most of it, most of the revenue side really relates to CPE. Most of the EPS side really relates to kind of the legacy business more or less and legacy revenues."

So but and the changes there basically about a $70 million change -- or increased decline rather, the CPE is $30 million of that, and again, that's lower margin revenue, and other legacy revenue declines is about $40 million of that. And that's made up of just a combination of items. So again, fourth to fourth now versus the 3% we talked about last quarter, we think it's more like 4.5%, but just about half of that is really related to CPE. So did I get your question with that?

So about $7.5 billion was allocated to the customer relationships. And again, we hope to have this finalized pretty much by the end of the third quarter.

So I think we'll be looking at additional capacity opportunities there, for sliding, a little bit -- talking about the $50 million increase or so there of what Savvis will bring to the table. Regarding IPTV, as I mentioned earlier, we're having good results in our markets overall. For competitive reasons, we won't talk, say too much about what we're doing, but I do think we'll be looking to roll, to begin build out in at least one Qwest market by year-end, buildout of IPTV products, roll out sometime next year. So that's kind of our view and, again, we’re looking to a great extent, like success base, we continue to see success in the CenturyLink markets that we have in the first build out of the Qwest, we see continued success. There is demand in the market. There's no question. There's demand for this product in the market. It's a quality product. We think it competes well with cable. Actually our customers on our surveys said it's a better product than what cable has in most cases. So we're confident. It's just a matter of significant plant situations, plant conditions, loop shortening opportunities as far as the economics of building out in the Qwest markets."

Our results our solid for the quarter as we continue to invest in key areas of growth, meet our integration objectives and build positive momentum in a number of areas across our business in what continues to be a challenging economy and very competitive environment. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.34 at the top-end of our guidance and reflect the full amount of cash impact of purchase accounting rules related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. Also included here is pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share which were $0.61 for the third quarter and exclude certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this adjusted diluted EPS figure rewrites a better view over the performance of our business. Stewart will provide more detail on the methodology for it this calculation shortly. Operating revenues for the quarter were $4.596 billion on a consolidated basis compared to $1.478 billion in third quarter 2010. The increase is due to the $2.73 billion and $223 million in revenue contributions we've realized, requests and Savvis acquisitions, respectively. Our strategic revenues grew 5% to $2 billion, driven by growth in high-speed Internet customer base while our legacy revenues for the third quarter are $2.21 billion, a decrease of 11.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010. We expect strategic revenues to soon exceed 50% of total revenues, maintain our track record of strong free cash flow generating $891 million for this quarter ahead of expectations. Our cash flow continues to support our financial strength and provide us with the flexibility we need to capitalize on opportunities to optimize customer experience and maximize shareholder value. To take advantage of these opportunities and promote the long-term growth of our business, we are focused on investing in 4 primary growth drivers: broadband expansion and enhancement; our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives; managed hosting and cloud services; and CenturyLink's IPTV offering of Prism TV. We believe that these growth drivers will change our overall growth trajectory over the next few years. 
Slide 6 offers more detail on each of these growth drivers and they specifically apply to the core. We continued to make significant investments in expansion and enhancement of our broadband network, achieved net increase of 57,000 high-speed Internet customers this quarter as substantial increase of the 12,000 we had in the second quarter 2011. We continued to make progress and developing expanding our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We've also enabled over 330 Central offers offices now with ethernet over capability target toward, of course, the SMB market. decreasing data transport needs of wireless carriers, we have also been working to complete fiber build as part of our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, in the last quarter we made substantial additions to our fiber-to-the-tower infrastructure. The integration of Savvis has given us new opportunities and managed hosting and cloud services which represent one of the most attractive growth areas in our sector today. We've already seen initial success marketing the Savvis offering across our business segments and our investing in Savvis data center capacity to meet growing demands for these services. 
Finally, we are pleased to report that Prism TV come our IPTV offering is performing well in the markets where it's currently available. We expect to generate strong sales trends and additional markets in the future. Now we are optimistic about our Prism TV products and its impacts future performance. 
Moving onto operating segment highlights, let's begin with Slide 7. The regional markets segment generated $2.2 billion in total revenues. This is down 6.1% for the total revenues generated pro forma third quarter of 2010 due primarily to the continued decline in legacy services compared to last year. Strategic revenues for the segment were up 2.5% from pro forma third quarter 2010 and up 5.3% when normalized for allocations between strategic legacy classification at a certain one-time items coming in at $720 million revenue for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of implementation of our local operating model, a more aggressive direct response to marketing strategy, we saw strong momentum in high-speed Internet, sales in legacy Qwest markets. We reported a reduction in access line loss of more than 20% this quarter compared with the pro forma third quarter more than 50% sequentially. We also successfully reduced our access line loss rate for the trailing 12 months to 7.1%, down from 7.8% in the third quarter of last year. We are encouraged by our 25% growth in Prism TV sales sequentially quarter-over-quarter, driven by expansion in new markets and increased sales channel focus. We are seeing continued success under our fiber-to-the-node initiative with 1 million homes to be added by year-end 2011 for a total of 5.75 million homes with fiber-to-the-node access. 
In the business markets, we continued to generate sales in strategic data services in legacy CTL markets and have seen an improvement in sales productivity in legacy Qwest markets due to heavier focus on the SMB sector. 
Shifting to the Business Markets Group. We continued to drive sales generating $927 million of total revenues, down 5.1% from total pro forma third quarter 2010. We continued to benefit from our advances in high-bandwidth offerings, although not yet offsetting the legacy revenue declines. The strategic revenues increased by 2.1% from pro forma third quarter of last year up to $443 million, excludes the low-speed special access revenue, our strategic revenue increased by 6% quarter-to-quarter. We exited the third quarter with a strong sales funnel we expect will provide additional sales opportunities in the fourth quarter. We've seen early success cross selling our managed hosting and cloud services, as well as our advanced network services to business customers and the Savvis, and Qwest legacy markets. And we intend to capitalize on additional opportunities in future quarters. We won our second large federal network contract this year demonstrating our continued ability to serve out the federal government sector in long-term customer CenturyLink now. Finally, we've strengthened our frontline sales team in an effort to drive additional business and increase our future revenue stream. 
Let's move on to our Wholesale Markets Group on Slide 8. Strategic revenues were up by 9.1% to $573 million, offset by legacy declines. This solid third quarter growth is driven by expansion of wireless and ethernet sales as part of our ongoing initiatives to broaden our wholesale client base. Including our ethernet and data transport services remained the top priority for us as we continue to win contract from wireless and other wholesale customers. As I mentioned earlier, we also continued to make progress on the fiber-to-the-tower buildout initiative completing nearly 1000 fiber build this quarter to bring our total 8200 fiber connected towers today. We have plans to complete an additional 2000 sites by the end of this year. The fiber-to-the-tower initiative continues to strengthen our wireless data transport capacity and we remain focused on meeting the growing data transport needs of wireless carriers in 2011 and beyond. 
As we outlined in our press release, Savvis will now reported as the fourth operating segment, Stewart will provide more detailed few minutes. Overall, Savvis as a solid third quarter and the demand for managed hosting and cloud solutions continues to grow. Operating revenues for the segment $223 million between July 15 to closing date of the Savvis transaction at September 30, while pro forma operating revenues were $260 million, an 8.3% increase from pro forma third quarter of last year. Our Savvis continues to see strong demand for Savvis symphony cloud solution suite as Cloud Computing revenue continues to increase led by steady demand for product dedicated solutions. 
Our bookings in the third quarter were slightly lower than the last quarter. Savvis experienced good traction affecting new customers in the business with particular success in the healthcare industry. The global economic environment is contributing to a challenging sales cycle across all verticals, but demand has not slowed. We remain confident that Savvis would finish 2011 strong. We expect to see an increase in bookings in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Managed hosting and cloud services are important to the future of our industry we are committed to investing in this key growth driver. As part of this commitment, we are expanding our data center footprint of 5 cities to bring our total sellable square footage to approximately 2 million square feet by the end of this year. 
As shown on Slide 9, we continued to make progress on the integration objectives and hit all our key milestones and synergy targets. We remain on track to meet our 2011 and 2012 integration, operating and synergy goals. We've substantially completed integration of the Embarq and plan to complete it by the end of this year. We are also on track to complete the conversion of our Qwest financial and HR systems by year-end 2011. To provide a little more color on the Qwest integration on the financial basis, we are on track to achieve synergies of $80 million to $100 million in 2011. We expect to close the year at a run rate of $190 million to $200 million in terms of synergies. 
And finally, we expect to achieve an annual operating expense synergy run rate of $575 million from the Qwest acquisition over the next 3 to 5 years, as well as the capital synergy number of about $50 million over the next 2 years. Despite large cost reductions made by Qwest prior to closing of the transaction, these synergy targets are in line with our initial projections and we are confident we will achieve all of them as planned. As planned. 
Our acquisitions are steadily improving in the performance of the business from both an operational and financial standpoint. Once the integration process is complete, we believe these acquisition will provide us the scale and scope we need to act on compelling new opportunities for growth. Our targeted annual run rate synergies from these 3 acquisitions totaled more than $1 billion once fully realized. We are also creating new advantages in data supply and transport as a result of our recent transaction. So far the 210,000, of our new combined network have substantially expanded our footprint and granted us access us to new market. Also, Qwest and Savvis has supplied us with a superb suite of product and services to our business enterprise customers throughout the country. These offerings combine the data centers that we acquired from the Qwest and Savvis transaction position us as a global leader in managed hosting and cloud services, and provide us with the compelling long-term growth aspects and cross-selling opportunities. 
As I mentioned earlier, Centrally Prism TV represents 1 of our 4 key growth drivers in our target markets. On Slide 11, it lays that progress around CenturyLink Prism TV and for in the future. IPTV revenues are currently less than essential to our top line than other parts of our business. Prism is having a material impact on line loss, high-speed sales and product attached rates in the markets where we offer this service. 
I'd like the draw your attention to a couple of highlights on the slide. Over the past 12 months, our Prism subscriber base has grown 103% or nearly 25% growth in the third quarter alone. In terms of pull through of other services, 70% of our Prism customers have a triple play and almost 50% of our Prism and are new customers were strong attachment rates of high-speed Internet and voice services. As of September 30, there are approximately 54,000 Prism subscribers and the services are now available to 1 million households across 8 markets. To achieve our goal of reaching 4.5 million to 5 million households by the end of 2015, we're planning to launch CenturyLink Prism TV in 2 additional markets in 2012, with additional launches planned for 2013 through 2015. We do not expect capital spend for Prism TV to exceed $250 million annually between 2012 and 2015, and we anticipate that service will become EBITDA positive across all launched markets by the end of 2015. We are taking a very capital efficient approach in Prism deployment by leveraging existing network investments such as fiber-to-the-node to keep start up capital costs for household past under $200. I'd now like to turn this call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stewart?"

I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. As Glen noted earlier",1193,"Thank you, Glen. I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. 
As Glen noted earlier, we have begun to report pro forma adjusted diluted EPS, a figure which calls out certain unique items that we believe will help you better understand our results and provide a clear picture of our underlying business. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS excludes most of the impact of noncash items on diluted earnings per share resulting from business combination accounting rules, as others in our industry have done following large acquisitions. Those items excluded are the noncash impact of amortization of intangibles and the noncash impact to interest expense of the assignment of fair value to debt outstanding related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. 
For third quarter 2011, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61. Beginning with Slide 13, I will take you through our consolidated financial results. In order to be more relevant, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Qwest and Savvis were fully included in the results for all periods. 
As you can see, we generated a strong operating revenues and cash flows during the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.63 billion compared with third quarter 2010 pro forma operating revenues, declined 4.6% from $4.86 billion a year ago. Strategic service revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion, up from $1.91 billion in pro forma third quarter 2010. Legacy service revenues for the third quarter were $2.21 billion, a decrease of 10.8% from the $2.48 billion in pro forma revenue in third quarter 2010. Data integration revenue has represented $166 million and other revenue consisting primarily of Universal Service Fundies was $247 million. Pro forma cash operating expenses declined about 1.7% compared to third quarter 2010, with synergy achievements and other cost reductions partially offset by the costs related to the additional rollout of Prism TV, the write off of certain previously capitalized IT projects related to the business combinations and other items outlined in the press release. 
We continued to be proud of our strong cash flow generation which was $1.89 billion for the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding special items, less capital expenditures, was $891 million this quarter, and represents a decrease of about 8.6% from $969 million in forma third quarter 2010. The decline in free cash flow was driven by an increase in capital expenditures of $110 million. 
Now turning our discussion to our operating segments, On Slide 14, as you all know, last quarter, we began reporting results for our Regional Markets Group, Business Markets Group and Wholesale Markets Group. This quarter, we've also added Savvis as a discrete operating segment and we'll be discussing it as a separate segment as well. 
The Regional Markets Group generated $2.22 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 6.1% over pro forma third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $729 million in the quarter, up 2.5% pro forma year-over-year. Excluding certain one-time items and shifts in the allocation between strategic and legacy revenue categories during the third quarter, the normalized growth rate for strategic revenue was 5.3%. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined $156 million or 9.7% from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our data integration revenues for our RMG declined $5 million or about 13.5%. Our total segment expenses in RMG declined 3.4% to $1 billion from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our expense reductions for the third quarter are mainly driven by synergy achievements that were partially offset by costs related to rollout of Prism TV in additional markets during 2011. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business markets generated $927 million in operating revenues during the third quarter, which represented a decrease of 5.1% from pro forma third quarter 2010, and was the result of declines in legacy services which more than offset growth in our high-bandwidth broadband offerings. Excluding the decline in data integration revenues, the total percentage decline for the quarter was only 2.9%. Third quarter strategic revenues increased by $9 million or 2.1% to $443 million from pro forma third quarter 2010, driven primarily by ethernet and MPLS services. Our legacy revenue for BMG declined from third quarter 2010 by $33 million, while data integration revenues decreased $26 million or 16.3% primarily due to lower equipment sales opportunities. Our total segment expenses in BMG decline by 1.2% to $570 million for pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Moving to Slide 16. Our Wholesale Markets Group generated $979 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 3.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010 as access and long distance revenues continued to decline though were partially offset by the acceleration in wireless carrier bandwidth expansion during the quarter. 
Strategic revenues for WMG grew to $573 million, representing a 9.1% increase from third quarter 2010, primarily driven by continued data transport from wireless providers. Our legacy revenues declined by $80 million or 16.5% to $406 million. Our total segment expenses in WMG declined to $297 million from pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Now turning to Slide 17 in our Savvis segment. During its first quarter as a distinct operating segment, Savvis generated $223 million in operating revenues and $260 million in pro forma operating revenues, representing an increase of 8.3% from pro forma third quarter 2010 revenues of $240 million. This growth comes primarily from year-over-year increases of 22% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues, 12% growth in hosting revenues and a slight decline in network services. Savvis' operating expenses were $200 million in the third quarter compared to $189 million in pro forma third quarter 2010. This increase of 5.8% is due to staffing and maintenance costs to drive managed hosting growth across sales, consulting and operations, as well as costs for data center expansions. 
Now moving to Slide 18, which addresses our guidance for the remainder of year 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2011, CenturyLink projects total revenues of $4.60 billion to $4.65 billion and operating cash flow between $1.87 billion and $1.92 billion. For full year 2011, in the pro forma full year 2011, CenturyLink's previous guidance for operating revenues, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and free cash flow has not changed. We are also providing additional guidance for pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2011 to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.72, and a pro forma basis, to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.69. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for  fourth quarter 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62. This compares to $0.60 in the third quarter of this year. We also continued to anticipate that our dividend payout ratio will be approximately 50% based on our previous pro forma free cash flow guidance of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. That concludes our prepared remarks, so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

Qwest had rolled out high-speed data capabilities about 3 million homes if I'm not mistaken. What are your thoughts around rolling Prism out on top of those already upgraded data rates in the Qwest territory? And then secondly, on integration of Savvis, you did a great job with the finance integration of the Embarq and the Qwest properties. So I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how the integrations going there. I know it's not so much about cost savings, but talk about integrating the sales force and then possibly even cross selling the Qwest data centers that you've got now in your portfolio that the Savvis sales portion knows how to sell, your thoughts on that, and where you are on that process."

You got fiber deep into the network, a portion of your customers, so it's a real advantage for us. To set up the rollout of Prism TV and one; of the reasons that the maximum we'll spend in any year is $250 million, we expected less in those years for the next 3 to 4 years. But that's a key reason and we can keep our cost for under $200 a customer for this effort. So it's certainly an asset for us. As far as the Savvis and the Qwest data centers, we will actually move the Qwest data center operation over to Savvis at the beginning of the year. We should see impacts from that if Savvis obviously new that's where their focus is and we have not seen a large growth in data hosting with the Qwest side to date. It will be positive for us. We just I mentioned we completed original engagement across the sales force just now that we are moving forward quickly with that. We are training the CenturyLink sales force, enterprise our sales force to sell the cloud and hosting product. So we feel very good about where we are headed.

Our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to invest in key areas of growth, meet our integration objectives and build positive momentum in a number of areas across our business in what continues to be a challenging economy and very competitive environment. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.34 at the top end of our guidance and reflect the full noncash impact of purchase accounting rules related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. Also included here is pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share which were $0.61 for the third quarter and exclude certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this adjusted diluted EPS figure provides a better view of the performance of our business. Stewart will provide more detail on the methodology for this calculation shortly. Operating revenues for the quarter were $4.596 billion on a consolidated basis compared to $1.748 billion in the third quarter 2010. The increase is due to the $2.73 billion and $223 million in revenue contributions we've realized with the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions, respectively. Our strategic revenues grew 5% to $2 billion, driven by growth in our high-speed Internet customer base, while our legacy revenues for the third quarter are $2.21 billion, a decrease of 11.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010. We expect strategic revenues to soon exceed 50% of total revenues. We maintained our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $891 million for this quarter ahead of expectations. Our cash flow continued to support our financial strength and provides us with the flexibility we need to capitalize on opportunities to optimize the customer experience and maximize shareholder value. To take advantage of these opportunities and promote the long-term growth of our business, we are focused on investing in 4 primary growth drivers: broadband expansion and enhancement; our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives; Managed Hosting and cloud services; and CenturyLink's IPTV offering, Prism TV. We believe that these growth drivers will change our overall growth trajectory over the next few years. 
Slide 6 offers more detail on each of these growth drivers and they specifically apply to the quarter. We continue to make significant investments in the expansion and enhancement of our broadband network. We achieved a net increase of 57,000 high-speed Internet customers this quarter, a substantial increase over the 12,000 we had in the second quarter of 2011. We continue to make progress in developing and expanding our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We've also enabled over 330 central offices now with Ethernet over copper capability targeted toward, of course, the SMB market. To meet the increasing data transport needs of wireless carriers, we have also been working to complete fiber build as part of our fiber-to-the-tower initiative. In the last quarter, we made substantial additions to our fiber-to-the-tower infrastructure. The integration of Savvis has given us new opportunities in Managed Hosting and cloud services, which represents one of the most attractive growth areas in our sector today. We've already seen initial success marketing the Savvis offerings across our business segments and are investing in the expansion of the Savvis data center capacity to meet growing demands for these services. 
Finally, we're pleased to report that CenturyLink Prism TV, our IPTV offering is performing well in the markets where it's currently available. We expect to generate strong sales trends and additional markets in the future. We are optimistic about our Prism TV products and its impacts on future performance. 
Moving on to our operating segment highlights, let's begin with Slide 7. The Regional Markets segment generated $2.2 billion in total revenues. This is down 6.1% for the total revenues generated pro forma third quarter of 2010, due primarily to the continued decline in legacy services compared to last year. Total strategic revenues for the segment were up 2.5% from pro forma third quarter 2010 and up 5.3% when normalized for allocations between strategic and legacy classification and certain one-time items coming in at $720 million revenue for the quarter. For the full quarter of implementation of our local operating model and more aggressive direct response to marketing strategy, we saw strong momentum on high-speed Internet, sales in legacy Qwest markets. We reported a reduction in access line loss of more than 20% this quarter compared with the pro forma third quarter and more than 15% sequentially. We also successfully reduced our access line loss rate for the trailing 12 months to 7.1%, down from 7.8% in the third quarter of last year. We were encouraged by our 25% growth in Prism TV sales sequentially quarter-over-quarter, driven by expansion in new markets and increased sales channel focus. We're seeing continued success under our fiber-to-the-node initiative with 1 million homes to be added by year-end 2011 for a total of 5.75 million homes with fiber-to-the-node access. 
In the Business Markets, we continued to generate sales in strategic data services in legacy CTL markets and have seen an improvement in sales productivity in legacy Qwest markets due to heavier focus on the SMB sector. 
Shifting to the Business Markets Group. We continued to drive sales, generating $927 million of total revenues, down 5.1% from total pro forma third quarter 2010. We continued to benefit from our advances in high-bandwidth offerings, although not yet offsetting the legacy revenue decline. Total strategic revenues increased by 2.1% from pro forma third quarter of last year up to $443 million. If you exclude the Low Speed Special Access revenue, our strategic revenue increased by 6% quarter-to-quarter. We exited the third quarter with a strong sales funnel. We expect it will provide additional sales opportunities in the fourth quarter. We've seen early success cross selling our Managed Hosting and cloud services, as well as our advanced network services to business customers in the Savvis and Qwest legacy markets. And we intend to capitalize on additional opportunities in future quarters. We won our second large federal networks contract this year, demonstrating our continued ability to serve out the federal government sector, a long-term customer of CenturyLink now. Finally, we have strengthened our frontline sales team in an effort to drive additional business and increase our future revenue stream. 
Let's move on to our Wholesale Markets Group on Slide 8. Strategic revenues were up by 9.1% to $573 million, offset by legacy declines. This solid third quarter growth was driven by our expansion of wireless carrier bandwidth and Ethernet sales as part of our ongoing initiatives to broaden our wholesale client base. Improving our Ethernet and data transport services remains a top priority for us as we continue to win contracts from wireless and other wholesale customers. As I mentioned earlier, we also continued to make progress on the fiber-to-the-tower buildout initiative, including nearly 1,000 fiber build this quarter to bring our total up to nearly 8,200 fiber connected towers today. We have plans to complete an additional 2,000 sites by the end of this year. The fiber-to-the-tower initiative continues to strengthen our wireless data transport capacity, and we remain focused on meeting the growing data transport needs of wireless carriers in 2011 and beyond. 
As we outlined in our press release, Savvis will now be reported as the fourth operating segment. Stewart will provide more detail in a few minutes. Overall, Savvis had a solid third quarter as the demand for Managed Hosting and cloud solutions continues to grow. Operating revenues for the segment were $223 million between July 15 to closing date of the Savvis transaction at September 30, while pro forma operating revenues were $260 million, an 8.3% increase from pro forma third quarter of last year. 
Savvis continued to see strong demand for Savvis Symphony cloud solution suite as cloud compute revenue continues to increase, led by steady demand for private dedicated solutions. While bookings in the third quarter were slightly lower than the last quarter, Savvis experienced good traction and attracting new customers to the business, with particular success in the healthcare industry. The global economic environment is contributing to a challenging sales cycle across all verticals, but demand has not slowed. We remain confident that Savvis would finish 2011 strong. We expect to see an increase in bookings in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Managed Hosting and cloud services are important to the future of our industry and we are committed to investing in this key growth driver. As part of this commitment, we are expanding our data center footprint to 5 cities to bring our total sellable square footage to approximately 2 million square feet by the end of this year.
As shown on Slide 9, we continued to make progress on our integration objectives and hit all our key milestones and synergy targets. We remain on track to meet our 2011 and 2012 integration, operating and synergy goals. We substantially completed the integration of the Embarq and plan to fully complete it by the end of this year. We are also on track to complete the conversion of our Qwest financial and HR systems by year-end 2011. 
To provide a little more color on the Qwest integration on the financial basis, we are on track to achieve synergies of $80 million to $100 million for 2011. We expect to close the year at a run rate of $190 million to $200 million in terms of synergies. 
And finally, we expect to achieve an annual operating expense synergy run rate of $575 million from the Qwest acquisition over the next 3 to 5 years, as well as a capital synergy number of about $50 million over the next 2 years. Despite large cost reductions made by Qwest prior to closing of the transaction, these synergy targets are in line with our initial projections, and we are confident we will achieve all of them as planned.
Our acquisitions are steadily improving the performance of our business from both an operational and financial standpoint. Once the integration process is complete, we believe these acquisitions will provide us the scale and scope we need to act on compelling new opportunities for growth. Our targeted annual run rate synergies from these 3 acquisitions total more than $1 billion once fully realized. We are also creating new advantages in data supply and transport as a result of our recent transaction. So far the 210,000 route miles of our new combined network have substantially expanded our footprint and granted us access us to new markets. Also, Qwest and Savvis have supplied us with a superb suite of products and services to serve business enterprise customers throughout the country. These offerings combine the data centers that we acquired from the Qwest and Savvis transaction, position us as a global leader in Managed Hosting and cloud services and provide us with compelling long-term growth aspects and cross-selling opportunities. 
As I mentioned earlier, CenturyLink Prism TV represents 1 of our 4 key growth drivers in our target markets. Slide 11 lays out progress around Century Prism TV and our plans for this offering in the future. While IPTV revenues are currently less than -- less central to our top line than other parts of our business. Prism is having a material impact on line loss, high-speed sales and product attach rates in the markets where we offer this service. 
I'd like the draw your attention to a couple of highlights on the slide. Over the past 12 months, our Prism subscriber base has grown 103% with nearly 25% growth in the third quarter alone. In terms of pull through of other services, 70% of our Prism customers have a triple play and almost 50% of our Prism inwards are new customers with strong attachment rate to high-speed Internet and voice services. As of September 30, there are approximately 54,000 Prism subscribers and the services are now available to 1 million households across 8 markets. To achieve our goal of reaching 4.5 million to 5 million households by the end of 2015, we're planning to launch CenturyLink Prism TV in 2 additional markets in 2012, with additional launches planned for 2013 through 2015. We do not expect capital spend for Prism TV to exceed $250 million annually between 2012 and 2015, and we anticipate that the service will become EBITDA positive across all launched markets by the end of 2015. We're taking a very capital efficient approach to Prism deployment by leveraging existing network investments such as fiber-to-the-node to keep start-up capital costs for household passed under $200. 
With that, I'd like now to turn this call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stew?"
260149,141515005,183714,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter, and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. As Glen noted earlie",1196,"Thank you, Glen. I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter, and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. 
As Glen noted earlier, we have begun to report pro forma adjusted diluted EPS, a figure which calls out certain unique items that we believe will help you better understand our results and provide a clear picture of our underlying business. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS excludes most of the impact of noncash items on diluted earnings per share resulting from business combination accounting rules, as others in our industry have done following large acquisitions. Those items excluded are the noncash impact of amortization of intangibles and the noncash impact to interest expense of the assignment of fair value to debt outstanding related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. 
For third quarter 2011, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61. Beginning with Slide 13, I will take you through our consolidated financial results. In order to be more relevant, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Qwest and Savvis were fully included in the results for all periods. 
As you can see, we generated a strong operating revenues and cash flows during the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.63 billion compared with third quarter 2010 pro forma operating revenues, declined 4.6% from $4.86 billion a year ago. Strategic service revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion, up from $1.91 billion in pro forma third quarter 2010. Legacy service revenues for the third quarter were $2.21 billion, a decrease of 10.8% from the $2.48 billion in pro forma revenue in third quarter 2010. Data integration revenues represented $166 million and other revenue consisting primarily of Universal Service Funds was $247 million. Pro forma cash operating expenses declined about 1.7% compared to third quarter 2010, with synergy achievements and other cost reductions partially offset by the costs related to the additional rollout of Prism TV, the write-off of certain previously capitalized IT projects related to the business combinations and other items outlined in the press release. 
We continue to be proud of our strong operating cash flow generation, which was $1.89 billion for the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding special items less capital expenditures, was $891 million this quarter and represents a decrease of about 8.6% from $969 million in pro forma third quarter 2010. The decline in free cash flow was driven by an increase in capital expenditures of $110 million. 
Now turning our discussion to our operating segments. On Slide 14, as you all know, last quarter, we began reporting results for our Regional Markets Group, Business Markets Group and Wholesale Markets Group. This quarter, we've also added Savvis as a discrete operating segment and we'll be discussing it as a separate segment as well. 
The Regional Markets Group generated $2.22 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 6.1% over pro forma third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $729 million in the quarter, up 2.5% pro forma year-over-year. Excluding certain one-time items and shifts in the allocation between strategic and legacy revenue categories during the third quarter, the normalized growth rate for strategic revenue was 5.3%. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined $156 million or 9.7% from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our data integration revenues for RMG declined $5 million or about 13.5%. Our total segment expenses in RMG declined 3.4% to $1 billion from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our expense reductions for the third quarter were mainly driven by synergy achievements that were partially offset by costs related to rollout of Prism TV in additional markets during 2011. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Business Markets Group generated $927 million in operating revenues during the third quarter, which represented a decrease of 5.1% from pro forma third quarter 2010 and was a result of declines in legacy services which more than offset growth in our high-bandwidth broadband offerings. Excluding the decline in data integration revenues, the total percentage decline for the quarter was only 2.9%. Third quarter strategic revenues increased by $9 million or 2.1% to $443 million from pro forma third quarter 2010, driven primarily by Ethernet and MPLS services. Our legacy revenue for BMG declined from third quarter 2010 by $33 million, while data integration revenues decreased $26 million or 16.3%, primarily due to lower equipment sales opportunities. Our total segment expenses in BMG declined by 1.2% to $570 million from pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Moving to Slide 16, our Wholesale Markets Group generated $979 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 3.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010 as access and long distance revenues continued to decline, but were partially offset by the acceleration in wireless carrier bandwidth expansion during the quarter. 
Strategic revenues for WMG grew to $573 million, representing a 9.1% increase from third quarter 2010, primarily driven by continued data transport from wireless providers. Our legacy revenues declined by $80 million or 16.5% to $406 million. Our total segment expenses in WMG declined to $297 million from pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Now turning to Slide 17 in our Savvis segment. During its first quarter as a distinct operating segment, Savvis generated $223 million in operating revenues and $260 million in pro forma operating revenues, resulting -- representing an increase of 8.3% from pro forma third quarter 2010 revenues of $240 million. This growth comes primarily from year-over-year increases of 22% in Managed Hosting and cloud services revenues, 12% growth in hosting revenues and a slight decline in network services. Savvis' operating expenses were $200 million in the third quarter compared to $189 million in pro forma third quarter 2010. This increase of 5.8% is due to staffing and maintenance costs to drive Managed Hosting growth across sales, consulting and operations, as well as costs for data center expansions. 
Now moving to Slide 18, which addresses our guidance for the remainder of year 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2011, CenturyLink projects total revenues of $4.60 billion to $4.65 billion and operating cash flow between $1.87 billion and $1.92 billion. For full year 2011 and the pro forma full year 2011, CenturyLink's previous guidance for operating revenues, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and free cash flow has not changed. 
We are also providing additional guidance for pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2011 to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.72, and on a pro forma basis, to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.69. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for fourth quarter 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62. This compares to $0.60 in the third quarter of this year. We also continued to anticipate that our dividend payout ratio will be approximately 50% based on our previous pro forma free cash flow guidance of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

We put our new go-to-market in place. The increase in the shift into direct mail, direct response, marketing to noncustomers and marketing into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets have had made a difference. We did get an incremental juice from the DTV, NFL package. They did a lot of promotion, so we benefited from that, pulled through some HSI on that, as well as our brand campaign that's been out. So that was some incremental juice that won't happen in fourth quarter. So the programs will remain. In fourth quarter, we normally see HSI seasonality does slow down and also just focused on the continuation of the bundle. And then in terms of just access line losses, we just continued to improve there, the outs continue to improve as well as in."

We're going to have a few expense increases in the fourth quarter, about $17 million of so, of which $15 million to $20 million really related to higher revenue along -- around Universal Service, and potentially CPE that we expect to sell to customers.

We have actually focused more on the video model that we have, the wireless bundle in the last couple of quarters because that's where the opportunity was initially. We expect next year to put more emphasis on the wireless bundle, and we think the agreement with Verizon is very attractive.

And then just the increased sales forces that we expect to have, both in the BMG Group and in the RMG Group, to try to take market share back away from the cable companies and the CLECs areas.

So it's certainly an asset for us. As far as with the Savvis and the Qwest data centers, we will actually move the Qwest data center operation over to Savvis beginning of the year. We should see impacts from that. Savvis is, obviously, that's where their focus is, and we have not seen a lot of growth in data hosting in the Qwest side, CenturyLink side to date.

Thank you for joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2011 performance, and share our strategic areas of focus heading into the months ahead. I also have with us today our business unit heads. They will be available for questions as needed. We have Chris Ancell, who's over our BMG Group, Business Markets Group; Bill Cheek, over our wholesale Markets Group; and Jim Ousley, over at Savvis operations. 
Our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to invest in key areas of growth, meet our integration objectives and build positive momentum in a number of areas across our business in what continues to be a challenging economy and very competitive environment. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.34 at the top end of our guidance and reflect the full noncash impact of purchase accounting rules related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. Also included here is pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share which were $0.61 for the third quarter and exclude certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this adjusted diluted EPS figure provides a better view of the performance of our business. Stewart will provide more detail on the methodology for this calculation shortly. Operating revenues for the quarter were $4.596 billion on a consolidated basis compared to $1.748 billion in the third quarter 2010. The increase is due to the $2.73 billion and $223 million in revenue contributions we've realized with the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions, respectively. Our strategic revenues grew 5% to $2 billion, driven by growth in our high-speed Internet customer base, while our legacy revenues for the third quarter are $2.21 billion, a decrease of 11.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010. We expect strategic revenues to soon exceed 50% of total revenues. We maintained our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $891 million for this quarter ahead of expectations. Our cash flow continued to support our financial strength and provides us with the flexibility we need to capitalize on opportunities to optimize the customer experience and maximize shareholder value. To take advantage of these opportunities and promote the long-term growth of our business, we are focused on investing in 4 primary growth drivers: broadband expansion and enhancement; our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives; Managed Hosting and cloud services; and CenturyLink's IPTV offering, Prism TV. We believe that these growth drivers will change our overall growth trajectory over the next few years. 
Slide 6 offers more detail on each of these growth drivers and they specifically apply to the quarter. We continue to make significant investments in the expansion and enhancement of our broadband network. We achieved a net increase of 57,000 high-speed Internet customers this quarter, a substantial increase over the 12,000 we had in the second quarter of 2011. We continue to make progress in developing and expanding our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We've also enabled over 330 central offices now with Ethernet over copper capability targeted toward, of course, the SMB market. To meet the increasing data transport needs of wireless carriers, we have also been working to complete fiber build as part of our fiber-to-the-tower initiative. In the last quarter, we made substantial additions to our fiber-to-the-tower infrastructure. The integration of Savvis has given us new opportunities in Managed Hosting and cloud services, which represents one of the most attractive growth areas in our sector today. We've already seen initial success marketing the Savvis offerings across our business segments and are investing in the expansion of the Savvis data center capacity to meet growing demands for these services. 
Finally, we're pleased to report that CenturyLink Prism TV, our IPTV offering is performing well in the markets where it's currently available. We expect to generate strong sales trends and additional markets in the future. We are optimistic about our Prism TV products and its impacts on future performance. 
Moving on to our operating segment highlights, let's begin with Slide 7. The Regional Markets segment generated $2.2 billion in total revenues. This is down 6.1% for the total revenues generated pro forma third quarter of 2010, due primarily to the continued decline in legacy services compared to last year. Total strategic revenues for the segment were up 2.5% from pro forma third quarter 2010 and up 5.3% when normalized for allocations between strategic and legacy classification and certain one-time items coming in at $720 million revenue for the quarter. For the full quarter of implementation of our local operating model and more aggressive direct response to marketing strategy, we saw strong momentum on high-speed Internet, sales in legacy Qwest markets. We reported a reduction in access line loss of more than 20% this quarter compared with the pro forma third quarter and more than 15% sequentially. We also successfully reduced our access line loss rate for the trailing 12 months to 7.1%, down from 7.8% in the third quarter of last year. We were encouraged by our 25% growth in Prism TV sales sequentially quarter-over-quarter, driven by expansion in new markets and increased sales channel focus. We're seeing continued success under our fiber-to-the-node initiative with 1 million homes to be added by year-end 2011 for a total of 5.75 million homes with fiber-to-the-node access. 
In the Business Markets, we continued to generate sales in strategic data services in legacy CTL markets and have seen an improvement in sales productivity in legacy Qwest markets due to heavier focus on the SMB sector. 
Shifting to the Business Markets Group. We continued to drive sales, generating $927 million of total revenues, down 5.1% from total pro forma third quarter 2010. We continued to benefit from our advances in high-bandwidth offerings, although not yet offsetting the legacy revenue decline. Total strategic revenues increased by 2.1% from pro forma third quarter of last year up to $443 million. If you exclude the Low Speed Special Access revenue, our strategic revenue increased by 6% quarter-to-quarter. We exited the third quarter with a strong sales funnel. We expect it will provide additional sales opportunities in the fourth quarter. We've seen early success cross selling our Managed Hosting and cloud services, as well as our advanced network services to business customers in the Savvis and Qwest legacy markets. And we intend to capitalize on additional opportunities in future quarters. We won our second large federal networks contract this year, demonstrating our continued ability to serve out the federal government sector, a long-term customer of CenturyLink now. Finally, we have strengthened our frontline sales team in an effort to drive additional business and increase our future revenue stream. 
Let's move on to our Wholesale Markets Group on Slide 8. Strategic revenues were up by 9.1% to $573 million, offset by legacy declines. This solid third quarter growth was driven by our expansion of wireless carrier bandwidth and Ethernet sales as part of our ongoing initiatives to broaden our wholesale client base. Improving our Ethernet and data transport services remains a top priority for us as we continue to win contracts from wireless and other wholesale customers. As I mentioned earlier, we also continued to make progress on the fiber-to-the-tower buildout initiative, including nearly 1,000 fiber build this quarter to bring our total up to nearly 8,200 fiber connected towers today. We have plans to complete an additional 2,000 sites by the end of this year. The fiber-to-the-tower initiative continues to strengthen our wireless data transport capacity, and we remain focused on meeting the growing data transport needs of wireless carriers in 2011 and beyond. 
As we outlined in our press release, Savvis will now be reported as the fourth operating segment. Stewart will provide more detail in a few minutes. Overall, Savvis had a solid third quarter as the demand for Managed Hosting and cloud solutions continues to grow. Operating revenues for the segment were $223 million between July 15 to closing date of the Savvis transaction at September 30, while pro forma operating revenues were $260 million, an 8.3% increase from pro forma third quarter of last year. 
Savvis continued to see strong demand for Savvis Symphony cloud solution suite as cloud compute revenue continues to increase, led by steady demand for private dedicated solutions. While bookings in the third quarter were slightly lower than the last quarter, Savvis experienced good traction and attracting new customers to the business, with particular success in the healthcare industry. The global economic environment is contributing to a challenging sales cycle across all verticals, but demand has not slowed. We remain confident that Savvis would finish 2011 strong. We expect to see an increase in bookings in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Managed Hosting and cloud services are important to the future of our industry and we are committed to investing in this key growth driver. As part of this commitment, we are expanding our data center footprint to 5 cities to bring our total sellable square footage to approximately 2 million square feet by the end of this year.
As shown on Slide 9, we continued to make progress on our integration objectives and hit all our key milestones and synergy targets. We remain on track to meet our 2011 and 2012 integration, operating and synergy goals. We substantially completed the integration of the Embarq and plan to fully complete it by the end of this year. We are also on track to complete the conversion of our Qwest financial and HR systems by year-end 2011. 
To provide a little more color on the Qwest integration on the financial basis, we are on track to achieve synergies of $80 million to $100 million for 2011. We expect to close the year at a run rate of $190 million to $200 million in terms of synergies. 
And finally, we expect to achieve an annual operating expense synergy run rate of $575 million from the Qwest acquisition over the next 3 to 5 years, as well as a capital synergy number of about $50 million over the next 2 years. Despite large cost reductions made by Qwest prior to closing of the transaction, these synergy targets are in line with our initial projections, and we are confident we will achieve all of them as planned.
Our acquisitions are steadily improving the performance of our business from both an operational and financial standpoint. Once the integration process is complete, we believe these acquisitions will provide us the scale and scope we need to act on compelling new opportunities for growth. Our targeted annual run rate synergies from these 3 acquisitions total more than $1 billion once fully realized. We are also creating new advantages in data supply and transport as a result of our recent transaction. So far the 210,000 route miles of our new combined network have substantially expanded our footprint and granted us access us to new markets. Also, Qwest and Savvis have supplied us with a superb suite of products and services to serve business enterprise customers throughout the country. These offerings combine the data centers that we acquired from the Qwest and Savvis transaction, position us as a global leader in Managed Hosting and cloud services and provide us with compelling long-term growth aspects and cross-selling opportunities. 
As I mentioned earlier, CenturyLink Prism TV represents one of our 4 key growth drivers in our target markets. Slide 11 lays out progress around Century Prism TV and our plans for this offering in the future. While IPTV revenues are currently less than -- less central to our top line than other parts of our business. Prism is having a material impact on line loss, high-speed sales and product attach rates in the markets where we offer this service. 
I'd like the draw your attention to a couple of highlights on the slide. Over the past 12 months, our Prism subscriber base has grown 103% with nearly 25% growth in the third quarter alone. In terms of pull through of other services, 70% of our Prism customers have a triple play and almost 50% of our Prism inwards are new customers with strong attachment rate to high-speed Internet and voice services. As of September 30, there are approximately 54,000 Prism subscribers and the services are now available to 1 million households across 8 markets. To achieve our goal of reaching 4.5 million to 5 million households by the end of 2015, we're planning to launch CenturyLink Prism TV in 2 additional markets in 2012, with additional launches planned for 2013 through 2015. We do not expect capital spend for Prism TV to exceed $250 million annually between 2012 and 2015, and we anticipate that the service will become EBITDA positive across all launched markets by the end of 2015. We're taking a very capital efficient approach to Prism deployment by leveraging existing network investments such as fiber-to-the-node to keep start-up capital costs for household passed under $200. 
With that, I'd like now to turn this call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stew?"
260149,141515005,183761,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter, and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. As Glen noted earlie",1197,"Thank you, Glen. I'll take the next few minutes to review some of the financial highlights from this quarter, and I'll then spend a few moments explaining and expanding on the guidance that we included in our earnings press release. 
As Glen noted earlier, we have begun to report pro forma adjusted diluted EPS, a figure which calls out certain unique items that we believe will help you better understand our results and provide a clear picture of our underlying business. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS excludes most of the impact of noncash items on diluted earnings per share resulting from business combination accounting rules, as others in our industry have done following large acquisitions. Those items excluded are the noncash impact of amortization of intangibles and the noncash impact to interest expense of the assignment of fair value to debt outstanding related to the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis transactions. 
For third quarter 2011, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61. Beginning with Slide 13, I will take you through our consolidated financial results. In order to be more relevant, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Qwest and Savvis were fully included in the results for all periods. 
As you can see, we generated a strong operating revenues and cash flows during the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.63 billion compared with third quarter 2010 pro forma operating revenues, declined 4.6% from $4.86 billion a year ago. Strategic service revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion, up from $1.91 billion in pro forma third quarter 2010. Legacy service revenues for the third quarter were $2.21 billion, a decrease of 10.8% from the $2.48 billion in pro forma revenue in third quarter 2010. Data integration revenues represented $166 million and other revenue consisting primarily of Universal Service Funds was $247 million. Pro forma cash operating expenses declined about 1.7% compared to third quarter 2010, with synergy achievements and other cost reductions partially offset by the costs related to the additional rollout of Prism TV, the write-off of certain previously capitalized IT projects related to the business combinations and other items outlined in the press release. 
We continue to be proud of our strong operating cash flow generation, which was $1.89 billion for the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding special items less capital expenditures, was $891 million this quarter and represents a decrease of about 8.6% from $969 million in pro forma third quarter 2010. The decline in free cash flow was driven by an increase in capital expenditures of $110 million. 
Now turning our discussion to our operating segments. On Slide 14, as you all know, last quarter, we began reporting results for our Regional Markets Group, Business Markets Group and Wholesale Markets Group. This quarter, we've also added Savvis as a discrete operating segment and we'll be discussing it as a separate segment as well. 
The Regional Markets Group generated $2.22 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 6.1% over pro forma third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $729 million in the quarter, up 2.5% pro forma year-over-year. Excluding certain one-time items and shifts in the allocation between strategic and legacy revenue categories during the third quarter, the normalized growth rate for strategic revenue was 5.3%. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined $156 million or 9.7% from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our data integration revenues for RMG declined $5 million or about 13.5%. Our total segment expenses in RMG declined 3.4% to $1 billion from pro forma third quarter 2010. Our expense reductions for the third quarter were mainly driven by synergy achievements that were partially offset by costs related to a rollout of Prism TV in additional markets during 2011. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Business Markets Group generated $927 million in operating revenues during the third quarter, which represented a decrease of 5.1% from pro forma third quarter 2010 and was a result of declines in legacy services which more than offset growth in our high-bandwidth broadband offerings. Excluding the decline in data integration revenues, the total percentage decline for the quarter was only 2.9%. Third quarter strategic revenues increased by $9 million or 2.1% to $443 million from pro forma third quarter 2010, driven primarily by Ethernet and MPLS services. Our legacy revenue for BMG declined from third quarter 2010 by $33 million, while data integration revenues decreased $26 million or 16.3%, primarily due to lower equipment sales opportunities. Our total segment expenses in BMG declined by 1.2% to $570 million from pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Moving to Slide 16, our Wholesale Markets Group generated $979 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 3.2% from pro forma third quarter 2010 as access and long distance revenues continued to decline, but were partially offset by the acceleration in wireless carrier bandwidth expansion during the quarter. 
Strategic revenues for WMG grew to $573 million, representing a 9.1% increase from third quarter 2010, primarily driven by continued data transport from wireless providers. Our legacy revenues declined by $80 million or 16.5% to $406 million. Our total segment expenses in WMG declined to $297 million from pro forma third quarter 2010. 
Now turning to Slide 17 in our Savvis segment. During its first quarter as a distinct operating segment, Savvis generated $223 million in operating revenues and $260 million in pro forma operating revenues, resulting -- representing an increase of 8.3% from pro forma third quarter 2010 revenues of $240 million. This growth comes primarily from year-over-year increases of 22% in Managed Hosting and cloud services revenues, 12% growth in hosting revenues and a slight decline in network services. Savvis' operating expenses were $200 million in the third quarter compared to $189 million in pro forma third quarter 2010. This increase of 5.8% is due to staffing and maintenance costs to drive Managed Hosting growth across sales, consulting and operations, as well as costs for data center expansions. 
Now moving to Slide 18, which addresses our guidance for the remainder of year 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2011, CenturyLink projects total revenues of $4.60 billion to $4.65 billion and operating cash flow between $1.87 billion and $1.92 billion. For full year 2011 and the pro forma full year 2011, CenturyLink's previous guidance for operating revenues, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and free cash flow has not changed. 
We are also providing additional guidance for pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2011 to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.72, and on a pro forma basis, to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.69. Pro forma adjusted diluted EPS for fourth quarter 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62. This compares to $0.60 in the third quarter of this year. We also continued to anticipate that our dividend payout ratio will be approximately 50% based on our previous pro forma free cash flow guidance of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

So it's certainly an asset for us. As far as with the Savvis and the Qwest data centers, we will actually move the Qwest data center operation over to Savvis beginning of the year.

If I just look at some of the basic foundational things, one, it really is holding the general manager as a local model. The accountability, they have clearly a line of sight that you can't have from a corporate headquarters, and so they know what are the right grassroots, the marketing programs to implement in their markets, be it military, colleges, schools. They also work back with the corporate marketing group to make sure that we've got the right placement in terms of media, in terms of our direct mail, just increasing that direct mail and marketing to more of the noncustomers, as well as the Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. We increased our promotional call volumes significantly as a result of that. The Price-Lock which is a high-speed, it's a double play, it's a data and a voice play, has worked very well for us. Customers like the Price-Lock for 5 years. The give them some assurance in terms of their budget and it gets them in a bundle. So those are really -- and then from a channel standpoint, the call center, there has been a lot of focus on just sales execution in our model in terms of how we sell from a top-down approach, working through the needs of the customer. And we've improved our sales per hundred rate in every category there too. So I'd say just good execution by the team."
