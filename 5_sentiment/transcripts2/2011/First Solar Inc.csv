The strong res",2804,"Great. thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q4 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that 2010 was a good year and we exceeded the 2010 EPS guidance we set a year ago despite the many market uncertainties we faced. The strong results demonstrate the capability of our low-cost technology and PV systems solutions, the diversification of our markets and the strength of our systems pipeline, as well as some really good execution in the operations. For 2010, our net sales of $2.6 billion were up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net sales is $610 million increased 24% over the third quarter of 2010 primarily because the prior quarter included completed contract revenue recognition for the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and Q4 was impacted by our decisions to expedite Module replacement program.
Our fourth quarter net income was $156 million or 25.6% of net sales resulting in diluted EPS of $1.80. Diluted EPS for 2010 was $7.68 which exceeded our guidance. Return on net assets was 19.5% on a four quarter rolling basis, representing an EBA of over 7% or 200 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $1.1 billion increased $117 million sequentially.
Our Q4 production was 395 megawatts, up 27% versus prior year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by high line throughput, improved conversion efficiency and six additional days of production due to our adoption of a calendar year for financial reporting. The annual capacity per line increased by 3 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.6-megawatt per line. Across all production lines, this adds 138 megawatts to our current and planned annual capacity.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.6% which is up a half a percentage point year-over-year. Both conversion efficiency and capacity per line benefited as we successfully completed the process changes we began implementing in Q2. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75 which is down $0.09 or 11% year-over-year and down $0.02 compared to the third quarter. We also began construction of our new full line manufacturing plant in Vietnam with expected volume production in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving to Page 7. In terms of market development, we've made progress on several areas. We completed the construction of both the 30-megawatt Cimarron and the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain projects. We sold the 290-megawatt Agua Caliente project to energy energy contingent on receiving federal loan guarantee. Energy subsequently received the conditional commitment for that guarantee from the DOE and the sale was expected to be finalized when the loan closes in the second quarter. We expect to begin recognizing revenue on the first construction milestone in the second quarter. The PNM and Santa Teresa projects began construction in the first quarter.
We also achieved a number of milestones in our project portfolio. The AV solar Ranch 230-megawatt project received its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from LA County. The Silver State North 50-megawatt project received its right-of-way grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. And we signed a 250-megawatt PPA with Southern California Edison for our Silver State South project.
In Europe, as we previously discussed, in December, we implemented plan price changes for 2011 that reflect market economics give an expected feed-in tariff adjustments. The new pricing is designed to drive South routes by supporting project economics and yield an acceptable returns to project investors and partners. We also made progress in developing the Chinese and Indian markets. First Solar signed a memorandum of understanding with China Guangdong Nuclear to build Phase I of the 30-megawatt Ordos project. Under the MoU, CGN will be the majority owner of the project and performed the EPC. We planned to work together with CGN to establish the project economics with the government in China. In addition, we are discussing other project opportunities with partners across China. We also signed Module agreements in India, including with Acme tele power which contracted for 15-megawatt and Moser Baer Clean Energy which contracted for 25 megawatts. We see continued strong demand for our products in India.
On Page 8, you can see we completed 138 megawatts AC of North American projects in 2010: Sarnia, Copper Mountain and Cimarron. All three were completed early and under budget built out of velocity 2x to 3x faster than their predecessors. Two of those projects are also record breakers with Sarnia now the largest operating TV plant in the world at 80 megawatts and Copper is the largest in the United States at 58 megawatts. Overall, 2010 balance of system of cost improved almost 30% compared to 2008, which is well ahead of our 2014 balance of systems cost reduction roadmap.
The strong performance demonstrates the improvements our EPC team has made in reducing cycle time and cost per watt through engineering design improvements and economies of scale. Since costs make up a force in make a LCOE, these achievements are important as we advanced to our goal of great parity. Slide 9 shows the progress that we have made in adding new customers for utility scale systems and in selling additional projects to existing customers. Since the Q3 Earnings Call, we had sold 400-megawatt of projects and signed 37-megawatt of EPC agreements. Energy Energy is significantly expanded its relationship with us through its purchase of the Avalon Collie project and by hiring us to do the EPC and provide modules for their Santa Teresa project. Blythe also purchased two additional projects in Ontario. Next Sarah GE and platonic have become new buyers that First Solar projects and here in Arizona a new utility customer, EPS, selected First Solar to develop and provide EPC modules for the Paloma project.
On Page 10, you can see how we have grown our systems pipeline overtime, including the increase from 2.2 gigawatts in 2010  to 2.4 gigawatt as of today. The orange line shows our increase in project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008 to the planned 400 megawatts in 2011. This slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of the utility system customer base including IPPs, utilities and financial investors.
The next slide provides the detailed update of projects we intend to begin constructing in 2011, as well as a list of our contracted projects that are in development. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts of PPA, EPC for Ontario constructed projects. First Solar has the leading position of the 11 gigawatt contracted solar projects in the United States. We expect to execute on 400-megawatt DC from 12 projects in 2011 up from three in 2010, and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts in 2011. The growth in construction from about 165 megawatt GC in 2010 to 400 megawatt in 2011 also improved the economies of scale for both our development and balance of systems cost and the stable economics of these projects provides the buffer against declining bps in Europe. We've now sold almost all the projects we intend to construct in 2011 and are in discussions to sell the remainder. We also expect to sign new EPC agreements with partners that may contribute to 2011 growth.
Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for our utilities scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, low LCOE, vastly time to generation and attractive project economics. With the addition of the new Silver State South PPA, we are developing almost 1.7 gigawatt of projects with PPAs, as well as other projects that did not yet have PPAs.
On Page 12, as our latest analyst consensus forecast of the global PV market demand. On average, the 17 analysts included in this survey estimate that the 2010 market grew to 16 gigawatts, up 122% year-over-year primarily driven by Germany, Italy and North America. Analysts have a wide range of market estimates where the consensus to 2011 growth of 10% to 17.6 gigawatt. This is up 2.5 gigawatts from the December consensus due to an increase in expectations for Italy and North America. The market is expected to continue to diversify in 2011 with Germany declining from 7.4 gigawatt in 2010 to 6.2 gigawatt in 2011. Italy at 3 gigawatts, North America at 2.4 gigawatt and Japan, China and the rest of Europe at about 1 gigawatt each.
However, there is market risk due to several governments discussing potential changes in feed-in tariff structures and caps.
Turning to Slide 13. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy and investments. In Europe, as the result of the strong 2010 growth due to the major European governments are seeking to balance subsidy costs for the 2020 commitment to the EU on renewable energy targets. Germany, France and Italy are in the process of discussing additional changes to their feed-in tariff structures and potential market caps. This creates risk going forward and highlights the importance of global market development and project pipelines. In Germany, the government is expected to adopt the partial July and September pull in of the January 2012 FIT aggression. Germany appears to be targeting market size of 3.5 to 4 gigawatt per year. The French FIT program moratorium continues with the government considering a 500 to 800-megawatt cap on the annual market size and a reduction of the FiT, as well as introduction of a tender system for large projects.
Italy is evaluating additional subsidy changes for 2012, the unplanned reductions in 2011. This may include FIT restrictions on some prime agricultural land based on regional decisions. As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect a strong first half in Germany and Italy, with potential for tighter economics in the second half of 2011 as the industry adjusts to lower FiT rates.
We have taken a number of steps to mitigate these risks. First, pricing to our third-party Module business is at levels that we continued to believe are sufficient to drive sell through. Second, as we had in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4 gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our 400-megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline.
We are increasing our investments in market development to diversify our market exposure in North America, India, Australia and China. We are investing to drive for the lowest LCOE and maximize energy yields. In North America, the market could double to two gigawatts in 2011. The ICT cash grant was extended through 2011 which improves market liquidity. The industry is working to include the DOE loan guarantee extension and government budgetary legislation. The DOE program opens the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the abilities to place long term unguaranteed project bonds into the U.S. institutional market.
In California, the legislature is currently considering a bill which would increase California's renewables portfolio standard from 20% by 2010 to 33% by 2020. We believe that California IOUs, are well on their way to fulfill their 33% RPS requirements but a meaningful percentage of these contracted agreements may not be realized. So we look at this as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also working to encourage policy in other states like Florida and Texas to support the development of sustainable PV markets.
Meanwhile, new southwestern U.S. PPA prices are already declining from the $0.14 to $0.16 per kilowatt hour in our contracted projects towards grid parity of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour by 2014. In China, the government has stated its commitment to developing solar market of at least 20 gigawatt by 2020. Although the market has potential demand, the systems providers need viable public economics to realize projects and current economics enough to support sustainable market development. Currently, concessionary bidding prices serve as price benchmarks and there is the possibility of an additional round of biddings in 2011.
In India, the national solar mission objective is 22 gigawatt by 2022. In addition, several states, including, continued to drive additional meaningful demand through their own programs. We are investing resources to help the Indian market realize its potential and are working with the number of customers to deploy more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to about 600 megawatts in 2012, constrained by the high cost of capital which pressures the system prices.
In Australia, the federal government's the solar flagship program and state promoting market growth with first utilities scale production realization expected in the first half of 2011. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including two of the four shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of this solar flagships program. The winner is expected to be announced in Q2 of 2011.
On Slide 14, you can see the progress we're making in diversifying our demand, a joint portion of our megawatt shift declined from approximately 77% in 2008 to 46% in 2010. North America became the second largest portion at about 18%. We estimate France, Italy and Spain are about 17%, 12% and 4%, respectively. We expect the German portion will continue to decline to 30% to 35% in 2011. India is driving our growth in Asia from about 1% in 2010 to 8% in 2011. I want to highlight again that in 2011, we are significantly increasing our investment in market development to sell the unique challenges of new markets and segments. We are increasing spending in places like India, China, Australia, and the Middle East. We are working with existing partners as they expand globally, as well as adding new partners in local markets. First Solar's scale, global reach and systems expertise make us an attractive partner on a global basis which gives us the competitive advantage.
As the result, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of sales in non-German European, and North American countries that the industry, in 2011, compared to market estimates. Overall, we have good demand visibility in 2011, in line with typical industry seasonal patterns and the growth of our systems business, we have confidence in our ability to sell the two gigawatts that we plan on producing.
We illustrate on Slide 15 our plants capacity expansion is now 2.9 gigawatt by the end of 2012, which is up 138-megawatt quarter-over-quarter based on the Q4 increase in annual lined run rate to 62.6-megawatt per year. Our annual line run rate has improved 17% since Q4 of 2009. And we will continue to execute on our capacity expansion plans. Malaysia plants five began production in late December and will ramp to full production by the end of the first quarter. Malaysia plan six is on schedule to ramp in the second quarter. As announced in the guidance call, the Frankfurt order expansion ramp was moved up one quarter to Q3 of 2011. In Vietnam, we broke ground on our initial full line factory in the doll not industrial park. We expect the initial production in the third quarter of 2012.
At our new Vietnam and new U.S. sites, we are investing in land and infrastructure to provide the options to expand beyond the initial four lines that meet future capacity needs. Our , France plants construction remains on hold pending clarity on for framework which we expect in March. We remain hopeful that the compromise will be reached to support a transparent sustainable market in France.
To summarize, we delivered solid Q4 in 2010 results that position us well for 2011 and 2012 growth. We expect solid growth in European markets in the first half of 2011, with tightening economics in the second half. First Solar will manage in this environment similar as we did in 2010. We're diversifying geographically and by segments. Our pricing is set to drive sell through with expected FiTs and competitive environment. We are continuing to execute on our mission and growth strategy. We are confident in our ability to start what we make with good demand visibility through European and Indian contracts and in North American projects flexibility. We are investing in market development and we're organized to execute. First Solar is on a roadmap to minimize LCOE and maximize energy yield. The North American utility scale pipeline grew to 2.4 gigawatt and we sold 400 megawatts of projects. Our 2012 year end capacity is now 2.9 gigawatt, with expansions on plan in Malaysia, Germany, the United States and Vietnam.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to James who will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial performance and our updated guidance for 2011. James?"
4593731,127101739,106274,"First Solar, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon. Let me start with Page 18. First Solar delivered solid financial results in 2010. Net sales grew 24% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion.Property module was 29.2% and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $",1434,"Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon. Let me start with Page 18. First Solar delivered solid financial results in 2010. Net sales grew 24% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion.
Property module was 29.2% and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $7.68, above the guidance range we provided in December of 2009 and also above our bigger guidance from our third quarter 2010 earnings call. We achieved what we return on net assets of 19.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 7%.
Moving on to net sales. During the fourth quarter, demand met our expectations with continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $609.8 million, down $188.1 million or 24% compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower systems revenue recognition. For example, Sarnia Phase 2 revenue recognition occurred in the third quarter, additionally, ASP declines due to mix and to implementation of 2011 pricing in December. And as Rob mentioned earlier, we delivered the firm volumes to expedite the Module replacement programs. This impact will partially offset by positive effects of increased volume, conversion efficiency improvements, and foreign exchange. Our ETC revenue mix declined from 28% of total net sales in the third quarter to 5% net sales in the fourth quarter.
The blend exchange rate in the fourth quarter increased 1.5% sequentially to $1.33 per euro while increased to 6% to $1.36 per euro. However, the stronger euro added net sales by only about 1% but we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 395 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 13% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by a 5% improvement in the line throughput to 62.6 megawatts per year and by the improvement of our module conversion efficiency to 11.6%. We also had a six additional production days during the fourth quarter after moving to a calendar year.
Our Module cost per watt in the fourth quarter were $0.75, down $0.02 from prior quarters. Our core manufacturing costs per watt also declined by $0.02 to $0.73. This improvement was driven by our conversion efficiency improvements, the increase of line throughput and the material cost savings which was partially offset by equipment maintenance and upgrade, foreign exchange and the rent penalty.
Onto the next slide. Fourth quarter gross margin was 48.7%, up 8.4% from the prior quarter. The increase was the result of the mix shifted more Module sales, as well as lower margin costs per watt, including a conversion efficiency improvement. The increase was partially offset by foreign exchange in the lower Module ASPs also. During the fourth quarter, we reserved an additional $8.5 million for the module replacement program discussed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. In Q4, we conclude a claims process and based on our field the execution to date. We update our total replacement cost estimate. Our Module gross margin was 49.1% during the fourth quarter, in line with the prior quarter, but the cost per watt improvement and the strong euro offset the decline in average selling prices.
Turning to Slide 22. Operating expenses were up $20.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to an $8.4 million sequential increase in plant start up costs due to our capacity expansion to increasing expense on the reinvestment and the infrastructure investments of ERP implementation costs.
Slide 23 shows operating income trends. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $165.7 million compared to $211.6 million in the third quarter. due to the decrease in total net sales and increased investments. Also in the margins for the quarter were up 27.2% compared to 26.5% in the prior quarter due to the mix shifting into our Module segments that was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses just described.
On the next slide. Net income was $155.9 million or $1.80 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 10% for the fourth quarter, for the full year, earnings per fully diluted share were $7.68 and this effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Slide 25 illustrates that in the fourth quarter, we generated $105 million of free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow of $350 million. We spent $212 million for capital expenditure from the depreciation was $41 million. For 2010, we generated $143 million of free cash flow even after investing $589 million in capital to execute on our capacity expansion plans. Operating cash flow was $705 million.
Our balance sheet remained strong, but cash and all other marketable securities increased about $117 million quarter-over-quarter to over $1.1 billion at year-end. Debt decreased by $13 million and our debt to equity ratio continue to remain low at 7%. This leads me to our updated guidance for 2011.
We have made several key assumptions underlining our guidance. We maintain our start exchange rate function of $1.30 per euro. For the first quarter, we are fully hedged at the rate of $1.32 per euro for the full year, $1.58 percent of our net sales and a 72% expected net income were hedged that demonstrate $1.32 per euro as of today. The percent change in the dollar and euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $6 million and our net income guidance by about $3 million.
We adjust the pricing in December of 2010 to position our channel partners that fell through in 2011 in anticipation of feeding  tariff declines in Germany and other European markets. Our guidance reflects the expected feed-in tariff changes in 2011. We continued to plan to build 400-megawatt DCO of system projects in North America. We retained the flexibility increase that this amount should demand in other markets fell short of current expectations. However, will naturally decline as we progress through the year unless utilized. We began shipping Malaysia Plant 5 in the first quarter and we planned to rest plants six in the second quarter, followed by our second German plant in the third quarter. Our capital spending is primarily driven by the capacity expansion in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the U.S. and France.
Slide 28 shows that based on these assumptions we expect net sales to range from $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factor penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $15 million to $20 million. And the factories start up expense will range from $60 million to $70 million, slightly below our guidance. Stock-based to compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold that is in line with our prior guidance. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $910 million and $980 million, which is up from prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. We estimate that the year end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share should range from $9.25 to $9.75, up from prior guidance. Capital expenditure for the year is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D expenditures. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We net assets will range from 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by at least 5%.
Finally, Slide 29 gives you an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating margins through 2011. Please note that if you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 of each chart, the sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that for first quarter, we're expecting to recognize less than 15% of our full-year revenue guidance and the less than 12% of our full-year operating income guidance. The profile you'll see here is driven by the following assumptions.
First, factory capacity is renting throughout 2011. Second, Agua Caliente revenue recognition stopped in the second quarter and accelerate into the fourth quarter. Third, Canadian projects under the complete contract accounting showing revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against the European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenues. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

When the National Solar Mission first came out last year. It had some discussion around local content requirements and our position that we encourage the folks in India and the government officials to think about local content requirements further down the road. So our position then was that at some point, local content you want to encourage but you don't want to encourage it very early on in the marketplace. So initially, they exempted quite a bit of local content requirements in order to evaluate a number of technologies and if you're familiar with the marketplace in India, there are a number of small utility scale kind of 5-megawatt projects as part of the national solar mission and there are three or four very active state programs again that are encouraging a number of, if I would call them small utility scale projects. And so, so far, they've allowed the local content requirements to not be met so they can investigate technologies like ours which are not available for reduction in India today. I believe is that potentially, three or four years down the road after the market is established, they may reengage in that discussion. But at that point, the market has been validated and the market will tend to poll and the technologies that make the most sense for installation in India. And I think we're fine with that particular policy position."

We're basically, really looking at as we pointed out with visibility and really, the uplifting in terms of operating income is really in the benefit of the volume increase for better pricing that we're seeing in the European markets because we are able to actually move some of the volumes to and the of pricing in the customers. And secondly, we actually benefit from an FX well. So as I pointed that earlier we continued to drive efficiency from the cost per watt and that will contribute to the increase in operating margins. So all those together I think that those budgets really the key elements to the one we actually have increased in the operating income."

That is still in infancy and with that, we continued to see further rationalization and more aggressive bids as it relates to the weighted average cost of capital on the projects. That comes from an increased interest in understanding of the extremely favorable payback profile of the solar investment in the U.S. and more and more capital competing you have several already projects. Thinking about the U.S. on the debt side, as the U.S. commercial debt market is opening out project finance with longer terms and step-by-step gradually in terms of the more comparable to Europe. So that's gradually getting there along while not quite at the same volume. So as you know, we're executing a multipronged strategy between commercial debt financing. We're working on rating on some of the large projects for bond offerings and obviously we're very engaged with the DOE in both of the programs if you look in Europe, year, I would tell you that overall, the capital costs are gradually increasing. You were originally seeing a much more mature market so the continued derisking of the assets have less leverage as compared to the U.S. At the same point in time, obviously , there's upward pressure on the yield curve in the outer years that were financing along those assets. So we have seen increased interest rates. If you just look at KFW lending rates, for example, in Germany, that has risen slightly over 100 basis points over the past couple of months."

Thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that 2010 was a good year, and we exceeded the 2010 EPS guidance we set a year ago despite the many market uncertainties we faced. The strong re",2808,"Great. Thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that 2010 was a good year, and we exceeded the 2010 EPS guidance we set a year ago despite the many market uncertainties we faced. The strong results demonstrate the capability of our low-cost technology and PV systems solutions, the diversification of our markets and the strength of our systems pipeline, as well as some really good execution in the operations. 
For 2010, our net sales of $2.6 billion were up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net sales is $610 million, increased 24% over the third quarter of 2010 primarily because the prior quarter included completed contract revenue recognition for the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and Q4 was impacted by our decision to divert some volumes to extradite the Module replacement program.
Our fourth quarter net income was $156 million or 25.6% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.80. Diluted EPS for 2010 was $7.68 which exceeded our guidance. Return on net assets was 19.5% on a four-quarter-rolling basis, representing an EVA of over 7% or 200 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $1.1 billion increased $117 million sequentially.
Our Q4 production was 395 megawatts, up 27% versus prior year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by a higher line throughput, improved conversion efficiency and six additional days of production due to our adoption of a calendar year for financial reporting. The annual capacity per line increased by 3 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.6-megawatt per line. Across all production lines, this adds 138 megawatts to our current and planned annual capacity.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.6% which is up a half a percentage point year-over-year. Both conversion efficiency and capacity per line benefited as we successfully completed the process changes we began implementing in Q2. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75, which is down $0.09 or 11% year-over-year and down $0.02 compared to the third quarter. We also began construction of our new four-line manufacturing plant in Vietnam, with expected volume production in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving to Page 7. In terms of market development, we've made progress on several areas. We completed the construction of both the 30-megawatt Cimarron and the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain projects. We sold the 290-megawatt Agua Caliente project to NRG Energy, contingent on receiving a federal loan guarantee. NRG subsequently received the conditional commitment for that guarantee from the DOE and the sale was expected to be finalized when the loan closes in the second quarter. We expect to begin recognizing revenue on the first construction milestone in the second quarter. The PNM and Santa Teresa projects began construction in the first quarter.
We also achieved a number of milestones in our project portfolio. The AV solar Ranch 230-megawatt project received its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from LA County. The Silver State North 50-megawatt project received its right-of-way grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. And we signed a 250-megawatt PPA with Southern California Edison for our Silver State South project.
In Europe, as we previously discussed, in December, we implemented plan price changes for 2011 that reflect market economics give an expected feed-in tariff adjustments. The new pricing is designed to drive sell-through by supporting project economics and yield an acceptable returns to project investors and partners. 
We also made progress in developing the Chinese and Indian markets. First Solar signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Guangdong Nuclear to build Phase 1 of the 30-megawatt Ordos project. Under the MoU, CGN will be the majority owner of the project and performed the EPC. We planned to work together with CGN to establish the project economics with the government in China. 
In addition, we are discussing other project opportunities with partners across China. We also signed module agreements in India, including with ACME Tele Power which contracted for 15 megawatts and Moser Baer Clean Energy which contracted for 25 megawatts. We see continued strong demand for our products in India.
On Page 8, you can see we completed 138 megawatts DC of North American projects in 2010: Sarnia, Copper Mountain and Cimarron. All three were completed early and under budget, built out of velocity 2x to 3x faster than their predecessors. Two of those projects are also record-breakers with Sarnia, now the largest operating TV plant in the world at 80 megawatts and Copper is the largest in the United States at 58 megawatts. 
Overall, 2010 balance of system cost improved almost 30% compared to 2008, which is well ahead of our 2014 balance of systems cost reduction roadmap.  This strong performance demonstrates the improvements our EPC team has made in reducing cycle time and cost per watt through engineering design improvements and economies of scale. Since BoS costs make up a large portion of LCOE, these achievements are important as we advanced to our goal of great parity. 
Slide 9 shows the progress that we have made in adding new customers for utility scale systems and in selling additional projects to existing customers. Since the Q3 Earnings Call, we had sold 400 megawatts of projects and signed 37 megawatt of EPC agreements. NRG Energy has significantly expanded its relationship with us through its purchase of the Agua Caliente project and by hiring us to do EPC and provide modules for their Santa Teresa project. 
Enbridge also purchased two additional projects in Ontario. NextEra, GE and Plutonic have become new buyers of First Solar projects and here in Arizona, a new utility customer, APS, selected First Solar to develop and provide EPC and modules for their the Paloma project.
On Page 10, you can see how we have grown our systems pipeline overtime, including the increase from 2.2 gigawatts in 2010 to 2.4 gigawatt as of today. The orange line shows our increase in project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008 to the planned 400 megawatts in 2011. This slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of the utility system's customer base including IPPs, utilities and financial investors.
The next slide provides the detailed update of projects we intend to begin constructing in 2011, as well as a list of our contracted projects that are in development. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts of PPA, EPC for Ontario RESOP-contracted projects. 
First Solar has the leading position of the 11-gigawatt contracted solar projects in the United States. We expect to execute on 400-megawatt DC from 12 projects in 2011 up from three in 2010, and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts in 2011. The growth in construction from about 165 megawatts DC in 2010, the 400 megawatts in 2011 also improved the economies of scale for both our development and balance of systems cost and the stable economics of these projects provides the buffer against declining bps in Europe. We've now sold almost all the projects we intend to construct in 2011 and are in discussions to sell the remainder. We also expect to sign new EPC agreements with partners that may contribute to 2011 growth.
Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for utilities scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, low LCOE, fast lead time to generation and attractive project economics. With the addition of the new Silver State South PPA, we are developing almost 1.7 gigawatts of projects with PPAs, as well as other projects that did not yet have PPAs.
On Page 12 is the latest analyst consensus forecast of the global PV market demand. On average, the 17 analysts included in this survey estimate that the 2010 market grew to 16 gigawatts, up 122% year-over-year primarily driven by Germany, Italy and North America. Analysts have a wide range of market estimates where the consensus to 2011 growth of 10% to 17.6 gigawatts. This is up 2.5 gigawatts from the December consensus due to an increase in expectations for Italy and North America. The market is expected to continue to diversify in 2011 with Germany declining from 7.4 gigawatts in 2010 to 6.2 gigawatts in 2011, Italy at 3 gigawatts, North America at 2.4 gigawatt and Japan, China and the rest of Europe at about 1 gigawatt each. However, there is market risk due to separate governments discussing potential changes in feed-in tariff structures and caps.
Turning to Slide 13. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy and investments. In Europe, as a result of the strong 2010 growth due to the major European governments are seeking to balance subsidy costs for the 2020 commitment to the EU on renewable energy targets. 
Germany, France and Italy are in the process of discussing additional changes to their feed-in tariff structures and potential market caps. This creates risk going forward and highlights the importance of global market development and project pipelines. In Germany, the government is expected to adopt the partial July and September pull-in of the January 2012 FiT aggression. Germany appears to be targeting market size of 3.5 to 4 gigawatts per year. 
The French FiT program moratorium continues with the government considering a 500 to 800-megawatt cap on the annual market size and a reduction of the FiT, as well as an introduction of a tender system for large projects.
Italy is evaluating additional subsidy changes for 2012, the unplanned reductions in 2011. This may include FiT restrictions on some prime agricultural land based on regional decisions. As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect a strong first half in Germany and Italy, with potential for tighter economics in the second half of 2011 as the industry adjusts to lower FiT rates.
We've taken a number of steps to mitigate these risks. First, pricing to our third-party Module business is at levels that we continue to believe are sufficient to drive sell through. Second, as we had in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4-gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our 400-megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half, and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline.
We are increasing our investments in market development to diversify our market exposure in North America, India, Australia and China. We are investing to drive for the lowest LCOE and maximize energy yields. In North America, the market could double to 2 gigawatts in 2011. The ITC cash grant was extended through 2011 which improves market liquidity. The industry is working to include the DOE loan guarantee extension and government budgetary legislation. The DOE program opens the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the abilities to place long-term unguaranteed project bonds into the U.S. institutional market.
In California, the legislature is currently considering a bill which would increase California's renewables portfolio standard from 20% by 2010 to 33% by 2020. We believe that California IOUs are well on their way to fulfill their 33% RPS requirements, but a meaningful percentage of these contracted agreements may not be realized. So we look at this as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also working to encourage policy in other states like Florida and Texas to support the development of sustainable PV markets.
Meanwhile, new southwestern U.S. PPA prices are already declining from the $0.14 to $0.16 per kilowatt hour in our contracted projects towards grid parity of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour by 2014. In China, the government has stated its commitment to developing solar market of at least 20 gigawatts by 2020. Although the market has potential demand, the systems providers need viable public economics to realize projects and current economics enough do not support sustainable market development. Currently, concessionary bidding prices serve as price benchmarks and there is the possibility of an additional round of biddings in 2011.
In India, the national solar mission objective is 22 gigawatt by 2022. In addition, several states, including Gujarat, continue to drive additional meaningful demand through their own programs. We are investing resources to help the Indian market realize its potential and are working with a number of customers to deploy more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to about 600 megawatts in 2012, constrained by the high cost of capital which pressures the system prices.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state promoting market growth with first utilities scale production realization expected in the first half of 2011. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including two of the four shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of this solar flagships program. The winner is expected to be announced in Q2 of 2011.
On Slide 14, you can see the progress we're making in diversifying our demand. A joint portion of our megawatt shift declined from approximately 77% in 2008 to 46% in 2010. North America became the second largest portion at about 18%. We estimate France, Italy and Spain are about 17%, 12% and 4%, respectively. We expect the German portion will continue to decline to 30% to 35% in 2011. India is driving our growth in Asia from about 1% in 2010 to 8% in 2011. 
I want to highlight again that in 2011, we are significantly increasing our investment in market development to sell the unique challenges of new markets and segments. We are increasing spending in places like India, China, Australia, and the Middle East. We are working with existing partners as they expand globally, as well as adding new partners in local markets. First Solar's scale, global reach and system's expertise make us an attractive partner on a global basis which gives us the competitive advantage.
As the result, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of sales in non-German European, and North American countries in the industry in 2011 compared to market estimates. Overall, we have good demand visibility in 2011, in line with typical industry seasonal patterns and the growth of our system's business, we have confidence in our ability to sell the 2 gigawatts that we plan on producing.
We illustrate on Slide 15 that our plants capacity expansion is now 2.9 gigawatts by the end of 2012, which is up 138 megawatts quarter-over-quarter based on the Q4 increase in annual line run rate to 62.6 megawatts per year. Our annual line run rate has improved 17% since Q4 of 2009. And we will continue to execute on our capacity expansion plans. 
Malaysia Plant 5 began production in late December and will ramp to full production by the end of the first quarter. Malaysia Plant 6 is on schedule to ramp in the second quarter. As announced in the guidance call, the Frankfurt order expansion ramp was moved up one quarter to Q3 of 2011. In Vietnam, we broke ground on our initial four-line factory in the Dong Nam industrial park. We expect the initial production in the third quarter of 2012.
At our new Vietnam and new U.S. sites, we are investing in land and infrastructure to provide the options to expand beyond the initial four lines that meet future capacity needs. Our Blanquefort, France plant construction remains on hold, pending clarity on the French subsidy framework which we expect in March. We remain hopeful that a compromise will be reached to support a transparent, sustainable [indiscernible] market in France.
To summarize, we delivered solid Q4 and 2010 results that position us well for 2011 and 2012 growth. We expect solid growth in European markets in the first half of 2011, with tightening economics in the second half. First Solar will manage in this environment similar as we did in 2010. We're diversifying geographically and by segments. Our pricing is set to drive sell through with expected FiTs in competitive environment. We are continuing to execute on our mission and growth strategy. We're confident in our ability to start what we make with good demand visibility through European and Indian contracts and in North American projects flexibility. We are investing in market development and we're organized to execute. First Solar is on a roadmap to minimize LCOE and maximize energy yield. The North American utility scale pipeline grew to 2.4 gigawatts and we sold 400 megawatts of projects. Our 2012 year-end capacity is now 2.9 gigawatts, with expansions on plan in Malaysia, Germany, the United States and Vietnam.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to James who will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial performance and our updated guidance for 2011. James?"

Net sales grew 24% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Operating margin was 29.2% and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $7.68, above the guidance range we provided in December of 2009 and also above our [indiscernible] guidance from our third quarter 2010 earnings call. We achieved a return on net assets of 19.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 7%.
Moving on to net sales. During the fourth quarter, demand met our expectations with continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $609.8 million, down $188.1 million or 24% compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower systems revenue recognition. 
For example, Sarnia Phase 2 revenue recognition occurred in the third quarter. Additionally, ASP declines due to mix, [indiscernible] implementation, 2011 pricing in December. And as Rob mentioned earlier, we delivered the strong volumes to expedite the Module replacement programs. These impacts were partially offsetted by positive effects of increased sales volume, conversion efficiency improvements, and foreign exchange. 
Our EPC revenue mix declined from 28% of total net sales in the third quarter to 5% net sales in the fourth quarter.
The blended exchange rate in the fourth quarter increased 1.5% sequentially to $1.33 per euro while the spot rate increased to 6% to $1.36 per euro. However, the stronger euro added a net sales by only about 1% but we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 395 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 13% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by a 5% improvement in the line throughput to 62.6 megawatts per year and by the improvement of our module conversion efficiency to 11.6%. We also had a six additional production days during the fourth quarter after moving to a calendar year.
Our Module cost per watt in the fourth quarter were $0.75, down $0.02 from prior quarters. Our core manufacturing costs per watt also declined by $0.02 to $0.73. This improvement was driven by our conversion efficiency improvements, the increase of line throughput and the material cost savings which were partially offset by heavy equipment maintenance and upgrade, foreign exchange and the rent penalty.
Going to the next slide. Fourth quarter gross margin was 48.7%, up 8.4% from the prior quarter. The increase was the result of the mix shifted more Module sales, as well as lower margin costs per watt including a conversion efficiency improvement. The increase was partially offset by foreign exchange in the lower Module ASPs also. During the fourth quarter, we reserved an additional $8.5 million for the module replacement program discussed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. 
In Q4, we conclude a claims process and based on our field the execution to date. We update our total replacement cost estimate. Our Module gross margin was 49.1% during the fourth quarter, in line with the prior quarter, but the cost per watt improvement and the strong euro offsetted the decline in average selling prices.
Turning to Slide 22. Operating expenses were up $20.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to an $8.4 million sequential increase in plant start up costs due to our capacity expansion, [indiscernible] on the investment expense on the reinvestment and the infrastructure investments of ERP implementation costs.
Slide 23 shows operating income trends. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $165.7 million, compared to $211.6 million in the third quarter due to the decrease in total net sales and increased investments. Also the margins for the quarter were up 27.2% compared to 26.5% in the prior quarter due to the mix shifting into our Module segments that was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses just described.
On the next slide. Net income was $155.9 million or $1.80 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 10% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, earnings per fully diluted share was $7.68 and the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Slide 25 illustrates that in the fourth quarter, we generated $105 million of free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow of $350 million. We spent $212 million for capital expenditure from the depreciation worth $41 million. For 2010, we generated $143 million of free cash flow even after investing $589 million of in capital to execute on our capacity expansion plans. Operating cash flow was $705 million.
Our balance sheet remained strong, but cash and all other marketable securities increased about $117 million quarter-over-quarter to over $1.1 billion for year-end. Debt has decreased about to $13 million and our debt to equity ratio continue to remain low at 7%. This leads me to our updated guidance for 2011.
We have made a several key assumptions underlining our guidance. We maintained our spot exchange rate assumption of $1.30 per euro. For the first quarter, we are fully hedged at the rate of $1.32 per euro. For the full year, $1.58 percent of our net sales and the 72% of our expected net income are hedged that demonstrate our $1.32 per euro as of today. The percent change in the dollar and euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $6 million and our net income guidance by about $3 million.
We adjust the pricing in December of 2010 to position our channel partners to sell through in 2011 in anticipation of feed-in-tariff declines in Germany and other European markets. Our guidance reflects the expected feed-in-tariff changes in 2011. We continue to plan to build 400-megawatt DC of system projects in North America. We retained the flexibility to increase this amount should demand in other markets fell short of current expectations. However, [indiscernible] naturally decline as we progress through the year unless utilized. 
We began shipping Malaysia Plant 5 in the first quarter and we planned to rest plants six in the second quarter, followed by our second German plant in the third quarter. Our capital spending is primarily driven by the capacity expansion in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the U.S. and France.
Slide 28 shows that based on these assumptions,, we expect net sales to range from $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factor then penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $15 million to $20 million. And the factory start up expense will range from $60 million to $70 million, slightly below our guidance. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold that is in line with our prior guidance. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $910 million and $980 million, which is up from prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. We estimate that the year end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share should range from $9.25 to $9.75, up from prior guidance. Capital expenditure for the year is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D expenditures. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Return on net assets will range from 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by at least 5%.
Finally, Slide 29 gives you an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating margins through 2011. Please note that if you'd read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 of each chart, the sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that for first quarter, we're expecting to recognize less than 15% of our full-year revenue guidance and the less than 12% of our full-year operating income guidance. The profile you'll see here is driven by the following assumptions:
First, factory capacity is renting throughout 2011; second, Agua Caliente revenue recognition start in the second quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter; third, Canadian projects under the complete contract accounting showing revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter; finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against the European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenues. 
With these, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

When the National Solar Mission first came out last year, it had some discussion around local content requirements. And our position, and we encourage the folks in India and the government officials to think about local content requirements further down the road. So our position then was that at some point, local content you want to encourage but you don't want to encourage it very early on in the marketplace. So initially, they exempted quite a bit of local content requirements in order to evaluate a number of technologies. And if you're familiar with the marketplace in India, there are a number of small utility scale kind of 5-megawatt projects as part of the National Solar Mission and there are three or four very active state programs, again, that are encouraging a number of, if I would call them, smaller utility scale projects. And so, so far, they've allowed the local content requirements to not be met so they can investigate technologies like ours which are not available for production in India today. Our belief is that potentially, it's three or four years down the road. After the market is established, they may re-engage in that discussion. But at that point, the market has been validated and the market will tend to pull in the technologies that make the most sense for installation in India. And I think we're fine with that particular policy position."

We're building the BoS content up in a way that we have variability with respect to how fast and how many megawatts we can deploy on those projects. So that flexibility remains. I think one comment we did make in the script today is, that obviously, as we move throughout the year, that flexibility for the year can decline and which is much more of a mathematical function of how much time you have left to install how many megawatts. But for the time being right now, we have the flexibility.

So we are seeing that ability has value in the markets, but overall it's a competitive market.

So we've taken an approach especially in Europe right now where there's a pretty broad market where developers that are easily, financially strained or might not have the working capital for project execution that are seeking partners. So we're seeking quite a view of those opportunities. Out of those opportunities, the one that fit our risk appetite and project profile, those are the ones we're acquiring. Generally, you should think of that effort as a fairly fast-turning business. These are projects that generally should be realized within a nine-, 12-month timeframe. So if we look at Italian assets, for example, we are keenly focused that we acquire any of those and realize them, that they are realizable in 2011. Now as we go beyond that effort and you look at markets like China, I will not necessarily describe ourselves as a developer in China. In China, we're bringing our core competency of being a system provider having EPC capability, having design know-how and obviously, a very low cost panel technology to partner with local developers."

I would say, if you think about the project finance markets for PV solar in the United States for example, that is still in infancy. And with that, we continued to see further rationalization and more aggressive bids as it relates to the weighted average cost of capital on the projects. That comes from an increased interest and understanding of the extremely favorable payback profile of the solar investment in the U.S. at more and more capital competing. So fairly, if you have several already [ph] projects. If you're thinking about the U.S. on the debt side, as the U.S. commercial debt market is opening out to project finance with longer terms and a step-by-step gradually in terms that are more comparable to Europe, so that's gradually getting there while not yet quite at the same volume. So as you know, we're executing a multi-pronged strategy between commercial debt financing. We're working on rating on some of the large projects for bond offerings and obviously, we're very engaged with the DOE in both of their programs. If you look in Europe, in Europe I would tell you that overall, the capital costs are gradually increasing. You were generally seeing a much more mature market. So the continued de-risking of the assets have less leverage as compared to the U.S. And at the same point in time, obviously, there's upward pressure on the yield curve in the outer years that we're financing along those assets. So we have seen increased in interest grades. If you just look at KfW [KfW Bankengruppe] lending rates, for example, in Germany, that has risen slightly over 100 basis points over the past couple of months."

Thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that 2010 was a good year, and we exceeded the 2010 EPS guidance we set a year ago despite the many market uncertainties we faced. The strong results demonstrate the capability of our low-cost technology and PV systems solutions, the diversification of our markets and the strength of our systems pipeline, as well as some really good execution in the operations. 
For 2010, our net sales of $2.6 billion were up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net sales is $610 million, increased 24% over the third quarter of 2010 primarily because the prior quarter included completed contract revenue recognition for the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and Q4 was impacted by our decision to divert some volumes to extradite the Module replacement program.
Our fourth quarter net income was $156 million or 25.6% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.80. Diluted EPS for 2010 was $7.68 which exceeded our guidance. Return on net assets was 19.5% on a four-quarter-rolling basis, representing an EVA of over 7% or 200 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $1.1 billion increased $117 million sequentially.
Our Q4 production was 395 megawatts, up 27% versus prior year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by a higher line throughput, improved conversion efficiency and six additional days of production due to our adoption of a calendar year for financial reporting. The annual capacity per line increased by 3 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.6-megawatt per line. Across all production lines, this adds 138 megawatts to our current and planned annual capacity.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.6% which is up a half a percentage point year-over-year. Both conversion efficiency and capacity per line benefited as we successfully completed the process changes we began implementing in Q2. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75, which is down $0.09 or 11% year-over-year and down $0.02 compared to the third quarter. We also began construction of our new four-line manufacturing plant in Vietnam, with expected volume production in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving to Page 7. In terms of market development, we've made progress on several areas. We completed the construction of both the 30-megawatt Cimarron and the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain projects. We sold the 290-megawatt Agua Caliente project to NRG Energy, contingent on receiving a federal loan guarantee. NRG subsequently received the conditional commitment for that guarantee from the DOE and the sale was expected to be finalized when the loan closes in the second quarter. We expect to begin recognizing revenue on the first construction milestone in the second quarter. The PNM and Santa Teresa projects began construction in the first quarter.
We also achieved a number of milestones in our project portfolio. The AV solar Ranch 230-megawatt project received its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from LA County. The Silver State North 50-megawatt project received its right-of-way grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. And we signed a 250-megawatt PPA with Southern California Edison for our Silver State South project.
In Europe, as we previously discussed, in December, we implemented plan price changes for 2011 that reflect market economics given expected feed-in tariff adjustments. The new pricing is designed to drive sell-through by supporting project economics and yield an acceptable returns to project investors and partners. 
We also made progress in developing the Chinese and Indian markets. First Solar signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Guangdong Nuclear to build Phase 1 of the 30-megawatt Ordos project. Under the MoU, CGN will be the majority owner of the project and perform the EPC. We plan to work together with CGN to establish the project economics with the government in China. 
In addition, we are discussing other project opportunities with partners across China. We also signed module agreements in India, including with ACME Tele Power which contracted for 15 megawatts and Moser Baer Clean Energy which contracted for 25 megawatts. We see continued strong demand for our products in India.
On Page 8, you can see we completed 138 megawatts DC of North American projects in 2010: Sarnia, Copper Mountain and Cimarron. All three were completed early and under budget, built out of velocity 2x to 3x faster than their predecessors. Two of those projects are also record-breakers with Sarnia, now the largest operating TV plant in the world at 80 megawatts and Copper is the largest in the United States at 58 megawatts. 
Overall, 2010 balance of system cost improved almost 30% compared to 2008, which is well ahead of our 2014 balance of systems cost reduction roadmap.  This strong performance demonstrates the improvements our EPC team has made in reducing cycle time and cost per watt through engineering design improvements and economies of scale. Since BoS costs make up a large portion of LCOE, these achievements are important as we advanced to our goal of great parity. 
Slide 9 shows the progress that we have made in adding new customers for utility scale systems and in selling additional projects to existing customers. Since the Q3 Earnings Call, we had sold 400 megawatts of projects and signed 37 megawatt of EPC agreements. NRG Energy has significantly expanded its relationship with us through its purchase of the Agua Caliente project and by hiring us to do EPC and provide modules for their Santa Teresa project. 
Enbridge also purchased two additional projects in Ontario. NextEra, GE and Plutonic have become new buyers of First Solar projects and here in Arizona, a new utility customer, APS, selected First Solar to develop and provide EPC and modules for their the Paloma project.
On Page 10, you can see how we've grown our systems pipeline over time, including the increase from 2.2 gigawatts in 2010 to 2.4 gigawatt as of today. The orange line shows our increase in project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008 to the planned 400 megawatts in 2011. This slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of our utility system's customer base including IPPs, utilities and financial investors.
The next slide provides the detailed update of projects we intend to begin constructing in 2011, as well as a list of our contracted projects that are in development. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts of PPA, EPC for Ontario RESOP-contracted projects. 
First Solar has the leading position of the 11-gigawatt contracted solar projects in the United States. We expect to execute on 400-megawatt DC from 12 projects in 2011 up from three in 2010, and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts in 2011. The growth in construction from about 165 megawatts DC in 2010, the 400 megawatts in 2011 also improved the economies of scale for both our development and balance of systems cost and the stable economics of these projects provides a buffer against declining bps in Europe. We've now sold almost all the projects we intend to construct in 2011 and are in discussions to sell the remainder. We also expect to sign new EPC agreements with partners that may contribute to 2011 growth.
Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for utilities scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, low LCOE, fast lead time to generation and attractive project economics. With the addition of the new Silver State South PPA, we are developing almost 1.7 gigawatts of projects with PPAs, as well as other projects that did not yet have PPAs.
On Page 12 is the latest analyst consensus forecast of the global PV market demand. On average, the 17 analysts included in this survey estimate that the 2010 market grew to 16 gigawatts, up 122% year-over-year primarily driven by Germany, Italy and North America. Analysts have a wide range of market estimates where the consensus to 2011 growth of 10% to 17.6 gigawatts. This is up 2.5 gigawatts from the December consensus due to an increase in expectations for Italy and North America. The market is expected to continue to diversify in 2011 with Germany declining from 7.4 gigawatts in 2010 to 6.2 gigawatts in 2011, Italy at 3 gigawatts, North America at 2.4 gigawatt and Japan, China and the rest of Europe at about 1 gigawatt each. However, there is market risk due to several governments discussing potential changes in feed-in tariff structures and caps.
Turning to Slide 13. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy and investments. In Europe, as a result of the strong 2010 growth due to the major European governments are seeking to balance subsidy costs for the 2020 commitment to the EU on renewable energy targets. 
Germany, France and Italy are in the process of discussing additional changes to their feed-in tariff structures and potential market caps. This creates risk going forward and highlights the importance of global market development and project pipelines. In Germany, the government is expected to adopt the partial July and September pull-in of the January 2012 FiT aggression. Germany appears to be targeting market size of 3.5 to 4 gigawatts per year. 
The French FiT program moratorium continues with the government considering a 500 to 800-megawatt cap on the annual market size and a reduction of the FiT, as well as an introduction of a tender system for large projects.
Italy is evaluating additional subsidy changes for 2012, beyond planned reductions in 2011. This may include FiT restrictions on some prime agricultural land based on regional decisions. As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect a strong first half in Germany and Italy, with potential for tighter economics in the second half of 2011 as the industry adjusts to lower FiT rates.
We've taken a number of steps to mitigate these risks. First, pricing to our third-party Module business is at levels that we continue to believe are sufficient to drive sell through. Second, as we have in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4-gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our 400-megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half, and we have the flexibility to build additional megawatts if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline.
We are increasing our investments in market development to diversify our market exposure in North America, India, Australia and China. We are investing to drive for the lowest LCOE and maximize energy yields. In North America, the market could double to 2 gigawatts in 2011. The ITC cash grant was extended through 2011 which improves market liquidity. The industry is working to include the DOE loan guarantee extension and government budgetary legislation. The DOE program opens the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the abilities to place long-term unguaranteed project bonds into the U.S. institutional market.
In California, the legislature is currently considering a bill which would increase California's renewables portfolio standard from 20% by 2010 to 33% by 2020. We believe that California IOUs are well on their way to fulfill their 33% RPS requirements, but a meaningful percentage of these contracted agreements may not be realized. So we look at this as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also working to encourage policy in other states like Florida and Texas to support the development of sustainable PV markets.
Meanwhile, new southwestern U.S. PPA prices are already declining from the $0.14 to $0.16 per kilowatt hour in our contracted projects towards grid parity of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour by 2014. In China, the government has stated its commitment to developing solar market of at least 20 gigawatts by 2020. Although the market has potential demand, the systems providers need viable public economics to realize projects and current economics do not support sustainable market development. Currently, concessionary bidding prices serve as price benchmarks and there is the possibility of an additional round of biddings in 2011.
In India, the national solar mission objective is 22 gigawatt by 2022. In addition, several states, including Gujarat, continue to drive additional meaningful demand through their own programs. We are investing resources to help the Indian market realize its potential and are working with a number of customers to deploy more than 100 megawatts in projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to about 600 megawatts in 2012, constrained by the high cost of capital which pressures the system prices.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state FiT promoting market growth with first utilities scale production realization expected in the first half of 2011. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including two of the four shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of this solar flagships program. The winner is expected to be announced in Q2 of 2011.
On Slide 14, you can see the progress we're making in diversifying our demand. A joint portion of our megawatt shift declined from approximately 77% in 2008 to 46% in 2010. North America became the second largest portion at about 18%. We estimate France, Italy and Spain are about 17%, 12% and 4%, respectively. We expect the German portion will continue to decline to 30% to 35% in 2011. India is driving our growth in Asia from about 1% in 2010 to 8% in 2011. 
I want to highlight again that in 2011, we are significantly increasing our investment in market development to sell the unique challenges of new markets and segments. We are increasing spending in places like India, China, Australia, and the Middle East. We are working with existing partners as they expand globally, as well adding new partners in local markets. First Solar's scale, global reach and system's expertise make us an attractive partner on a global basis which gives us the competitive advantage.
As the result, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of sales in non-German European, and North American countries than the industry in 2011 compared to market estimates. Overall, we have good demand visibility in 2011, in line with typical industry seasonal patterns and the growth of our system's business, we have confidence in our ability to sell the 2 gigawatts that we plan on producing.
We illustrate on Slide 15 that our plants capacity expansion is now 2.9 gigawatts by the end of 2012, which is up 138 megawatts quarter-over-quarter based on the Q4 increase in annual line run rate to 62.6 megawatts per year. Our annual line run rate has improved 17% since Q4 of 2009. And we will continue to execute on our capacity expansion plans. 
Malaysia Plant 5 began production in late December and will ramp to full production by the end of the first quarter. Malaysia Plant 6 is on schedule to ramp in the second quarter. As announced in the guidance call, the Frankfurt order expansion ramp was moved up one quarter to Q3 of 2011. In Vietnam, we broke ground on our initial four-line factory in the Dong Nam industrial park. We expect initial production in the third quarter of 2012.
At our new Vietnam and new U.S. sites, we are investing in land and infrastructure to provide the options to expand beyond the initial four lines that meet future capacity needs. Our Blanquefort, France plant construction remains on hold, pending clarity on the French subsidy framework which we expect in March. We remain hopeful that a compromise will be reached to support a transparent, sustainable photovoltaic market in France.
To summarize, we delivered solid Q4 and 2010 results that positions us well for 2011 and 2012 growth. We expect solid growth in European markets in the first half of 2011, with tightening economics in the second half. First Solar will manage in this environment similar as we did in 2010. We're diversifying geographically and by segments. Our pricing is set to drive sell through with expected FiTs in competitive environment. We are continuing to execute on our mission and growth strategy. We're confident in our ability to sell what we make with good demand visibility through European and Indian contracts and in North American project flexibility. We are investing in market development and we're organized to execute. First Solar is on a roadmap to minimize LCOE and maximize energy yield. The North American utility scale pipeline grew to 2.4 gigawatts and we sold 400 megawatts of projects. Our 2012 year-end capacity is now 2.9 gigawatts, with expansions on plan in Malaysia, Germany, the United States and Vietnam.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to James who will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial performance and our updated guidance for 2011. James?"
4593731,127101739,106493,"First Solar, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon. Let me start with Page 18. First Solar delivered solid financial results in 2010. Net sales grew 24% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Operating margin was 29.2% and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $",1452,"Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon. Let me start with Page 18. First Solar delivered solid financial results in 2010. Net sales grew 24% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Operating margin was 29.2% and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $7.68, above the guidance range we provided in December of 2009 and also above our data [ph] guidance from our third quarter 2010 earnings call. We achieved a return on net assets of 19.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 7%.
Moving on to net sales. During the fourth quarter, demand met our expectations with continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $609.8 million, down $188.1 million or 24% compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower systems revenue recognition. 
For example, Sarnia Phase 2 revenue recognition occurred in the third quarter. Additionally, ASP declines due to mix, [indiscernible] implementation, 2011 pricing in December. And as Rob mentioned earlier, we delivered the strong volumes to expedite the Module replacement programs. These impacts were partially offsetted by positive effects of increased sales volume, conversion efficiency improvements, and foreign exchange. 
Our EPC revenue mix declined from 28% of total net sales in the third quarter to 5% net sales in the fourth quarter.
The blended exchange rate in the fourth quarter increased 1.5% sequentially to $1.33 per euro while the spot rate increased to 6% to $1.36 per euro. However, the stronger euro added a net sales by only about 1% but we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 395 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 13% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by a 5% improvement in the line throughput to 62.6 megawatts per year and by the improvement of our module conversion efficiency to 11.6%. We also had a six additional production days during the fourth quarter after moving to a calendar year.
Our Module cost per watt in the fourth quarter were $0.75, down $0.02 from prior quarters. Our core manufacturing costs per watt also declined by $0.02 to $0.73. This improvement was driven by our conversion efficiency improvements, the increase of line throughput and the material cost savings which were partially offset by heavy equipment maintenance and upgrade, foreign exchange and the rent penalty.
Going to the next slide. Fourth quarter gross margin was 48.7%, up 8.4% from the prior quarter. The increase was the result of the mix shift to more Module sales, as well as lower margin costs per watt including a conversion efficiency improvement. The increase was partially offset by foreign exchange in the lower Module ASPs also. During the fourth quarter, we reserved an additional $8.5 million for the module replacement program discussed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. 
In Q4, we conclude a claims process and based on our field the execution to date. We update our total replacement cost estimate. Our Module gross margin was 49.1% during the fourth quarter, in line with the prior quarter, but the cost per watt improvement and the strong euro offsetted the decline in average selling prices.
Turning to Slide 22. Operating expenses were up $20.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to an $8.4 million sequential increase in plant start up costs due to our capacity expansion, the year increase on performance expense [ph], and the investment expense on the reinvestment and the infrastructure investments of ERP implementation costs.
Slide 23 shows operating income trends. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $165.7 million, compared to $211.6 million in the third quarter due to the decrease in total net sales and increased investments. Also the margins for the quarter were up 27.2% compared to 26.5% in the prior quarter due to the mix shifting to our Module segments that was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses just described.
On the next slide. Net income was $155.9 million or $1.80 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 10% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, earnings per fully diluted share was $7.68 and the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Slide 25 illustrates that in the fourth quarter, we generated $105 million of free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow of $350 million. We spent $212 million for capital expenditure from the depreciation worth $41 million. For 2010, we generated $143 million of free cash flow even after investing $589 million of in capital to execute on our capacity expansion plans. Operating cash flow was $705 million.
Our balance sheet remained strong, but cash and all other marketable securities increased about $117 million quarter-over-quarter to over $1.1 billion for year-end. Debt has decreased about to $13 million and our debt to equity ratio continues to remain low at 7%. This leads me to our updated guidance for 2011.
We have made a several key assumptions underlining our guidance. We maintained our spot exchange rate assumption of $1.30 per euro. For the first quarter, we are fully hedged at the rate of $1.32 per euro. For the full year, $1.58 percent of our net sales and the 72% of our expected net income are hedged that demonstrate our $1.32 per euro as of today. The percent change in the dollar/euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $6 million and our net income guidance by about $3 million.
We adjusted pricing in December of 2010 to position our channel partners to sell through in 2011 in anticipation of feed-in-tariff declines in Germany and other European markets. Our guidance reflects the expected feed-in-tariff changes in 2011. We continue to plan to build 400-megawatt DC of system projects in North America. We retained the flexibility to increase this amount should demand in other markets fell short of current expectations. However, that flexibility will naturally decline as we progress through the year unless utilized. 
We began shipping Malaysia Plant 5 in the first quarter and we planned to rest plant six in the second quarter, followed by our second German plant in the third quarter. Our capital spending is primarily driven by the capacity expansion in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the U.S. and France.
Slide 28 shows that based on these assumptions,, we expect net sales to range from $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factor then penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $15 million to $20 million. And the factory start up expense will range from $60 million to $70 million, slightly below our guidance. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold that is in line with our prior guidance. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $910 million and $980 million, which is up from prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. We estimate that the year end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share should range from $9.25 to $9.75, up from prior guidance. Capital expenditure for the year is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D expenditures. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT systems, facilities and other.
Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Return on net assets will range from 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by at least 5%.
Finally, Slide 29 gives you an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating margins through 2011. Please note that if you'd read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 of each chart, the sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that for first quarter, we're expecting to recognize less than 15% of our full-year revenue guidance and the less than 12% of our full-year operating income guidance. The profile you'll see here is driven by the following assumptions:
First, factory capacity is renting throughout 2011; second, Agua Caliente revenue recognition start in the second quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter; third, Canadian projects under the complete contract accounting showing revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter; finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against the European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenues.

When the National Solar Mission first came out last year, it had some discussion around local content requirements. And our position, and we encourage the folks in India and the government officials to think about local content requirements further down the road. So our position then was that at some point, local content you want to encourage but you don't want to encourage it very early on in the marketplace. So initially, they exempted quite a bit of local content requirements in order to evaluate a number of technologies. And if you're familiar with the marketplace in India, there are a number of smaller utility scale kind of 5-megawatt projects as part of the National Solar Mission and there are three or four very active state programs, again, that are encouraging a number of, if I would call them, smaller utility scale projects. And so, so far, they've allowed the local content requirements to not be met so they can investigate technologies like ours which are not available for production in India today. Our belief is that potentially, it's three or four years down the road. After the market is established, they may re-engage in that discussion. But at that point, the market has been validated and the market will tend to pull in the technology that makes the most sense for installation in India.

I think one comment we did make in the script today is, that obviously, as we move throughout the year, that flexibility for the year can decline and which is much more of a mathematical function of how much time you have left to install how many megawatts.

I would say that in the near term, that there's a big focus on the customer side as it relates to profit realization and execution track record and ability to hit aggressive schedules. So the utilities want to realize the generation capacity in order to get closer to their RPS goals on a true generation side. So we are seeing that ability has value in the markets, but overall it's a competitive market. I think the industry, overall, sees obviously that the U.S. is the fastest-growing, highest volume market for the next couple of years.

So we've taken an approach especially in Europe right now where there's a pretty broad market where developers that are easily, financially strained or might not have the working capital for project execution that are seeking partners. So we're seeking quite a view of those opportunities. Out of those opportunities, the one that fit our risk appetite and project profile, those are the ones we're acquiring. Generally, you should think of that effort as a fairly fast-turning business. These are projects that generally should be realized within a nine-, 12-month timeframe. So if we look at Italian assets, for example, we are keenly focused that we acquire any of those and realize them, that they are realizable in 2011. Now as we go beyond that effort and you look at markets like China, I will not necessarily describe ourselves as a developer in China.

I would say, if you think about the project finance markets for PV solar in the United States for example, that is still in infancy. And with that, we continued to see further rationalization and more aggressive bids as it relates to the weighted average cost of capital on the projects. That comes from an increased interest and understanding of the extremely favorable payback profile of the solar investment in the U.S. at more and more capital competing. So fairly few shovel-ready projects. If you're thinking about the U.S. on the debt side, as the U.S. commercial debt market is opening out to project finance with longer terms and a step-by-step gradually in terms that are more comparable to Europe, so that's gradually getting there while not yet quite at the same volume. So as you know, we're executing a multi-pronged strategy between commercial debt financing. We're working on rating on some of the large projects for bond offerings and obviously, we're very engaged with the DOE in both of their programs. If you look in Europe, in Europe I would tell you that overall, the capital costs are gradually increasing. Here we're generally seeing a much more mature market. So the continued de-risking of the assets has less leverage as compared to the U.S. And at the same point in time, obviously, there's upward pressure on the yield curve in the outer years that we're financing along those assets. So we have seen increase in interest grades. If you just look at KfW [KfW Bankengruppe] lending rates, for example, in Germany, that has risen slightly over 100 basis points over the past couple of months."

Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, but let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 m",775,"Great. Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, but let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 million. The first quarter net income was $116 million or 20.4% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.33. Return on net assets was 17% and a 4 quarter rolling basis representing an EVA of approximately 5% in line with our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance is $713 million, decreased $400 million sequentially as we invest in CapEx and new factories $100 million of debt and began construction of several systems and system projects, as well as funded our recycling program.
The Q1 production was 407 megawatts, up 26% versus the prior year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by the production ramp of the KLM 5 factory and improved by conversion efficiency partially offset by 7 fewer calendar days than in the fourth quarter. The annual capacity per line increased by 1.5-megawatt quarter-over-quarter so 64.1-megawatt. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year and in line with our roadmap. As the result of continuous improvement in efficiency and process, we recently relates our series 3 85-watt Module for higher efficiency applications. The Module manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75 which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of increased efficiency and material cost reductions were offset by factory ramp costs and fewer calendar days. Core costs which excludes the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation were $0.73 per watt, down 9% year-over-year in line with our cost reduction roadmap.
To summarize our capacity build out, in March, we announced Mesa, Arizona as the location of our previously announced four-line manufacturing plant in the United States with expected production ramp in the third quarter of 2012. Construction of our Vietnam site is progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012. reached full production by the end of the first quarter and Malaysia 6 is ramping in Q2 of 2011. Frankfurt order 2 remains on plan for third quarter ramp up this year. Our two line factory in France remains on indefinite hold, so we have removed it from our capacity plan pending further clarity on the tender process for projects in France.
Moving to Page 7. In market development, we are focused on executing our North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. We are expanding market diversity, growing pipelines and maintaining our technology leadership and business model flexibility to increase our visibility in 2011 and beyond. In North America, we began to execute on the 450-megawatt DC of planned 2011 systems builds, including Agua Caliente, several projects in Ontario, as well as Santa Teresa, PNM and Paloma. The Agua Caliente BOE loan guarantee is progressing and we expect the financing to close in late Q2 or early Q3. Topaz received its final environmental impact report and the Bureau of Land Management issued the final Environmental Impact Statement for desert site some light in April.
In Europe, we're managing through market uncertainty due to FiT and quality changes. Ambiguity about the magnitude of Germany's midyear FiT progression, lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process in Italy's delayed implementation of the new decree all created uncertainties about project economics and financing. Industry channels are adversely impacted by the lack of transparency around pending policy revisions that are contemplated FiT changes.
We're making progress in developing the Indian, Australian and Chinese markets. Our pipeline in India has the potential to drive more than 100 megawatts of shipments in 2011, up from 10 megawatts in 2010. In China, we are discussing additional agreements with leading Chinese generating companies.
We also announced that we will begin to offer our modules for installation to small as 10 kilowatts in response to customer demand having previously limited availability to 30 kilowatt systems. About a third of our modules are currently installed on rooftops around the world and this expands our offering in this growing market segment even our current customers more flexibility and provides access to new range of customers, which should further diversify our sales mix.
During Q1, we've hired a new CEO, Mark Widmar. Mark joined us in early April and he's proving to be a quick study. Mark brings nearly 25 years of experience in finance and accounting for First Solar, his broad technology and industrial background will be an asset as we continue to scale. Mark, please say a few words"

We continued site work on Agua Caliente and we expect to begin module installation in the third quarter. The 20-megawatt Santa Teresa project is under construction and is our first project resulting in the conversion of a CSP slight to PV and the first to employ trackers to increase energy yield.
The next slide list of projects in our contracted top line in North America. We highlighted the project in green for which execution has begun in 2011. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts a sea of PPA, EPC, an our Ontario resell contracted projects. We plan to execute on about 450-megawatt DC with contributions from a dozen projects in 2011, up from 3 in 2010. And we currently have the flexibility to build to up to 600 megawatt DC in 2011. We expect to sign new EPC agreements to continue adding to our contracted pipeline developed by First Solar and our partners.
Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for our utility scale systems project due to our proven systems performance, execution record and attractive financial profile.
Turning to Slide 11. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how this relates to First Solar's growth strategy and our investments. In Europe, Germany, France and Italy are implementing changes to their feed-in tariff structures, market caps and tender processes. The industry will require a period of adjustment and understanding of the changes since some of the implementation details have not been finalized. In addition, the Italian government decision-making process resulted in a market cause and excess channel inventories. Rising European interest rates are also applying pressure to project economics. These factors create a demand, oversupply and price risks, and highlight the importance of a global market development and project pipelines, which are strengths for First Solar.
Tighter industry economics are expected in the second half of 2011, which we believe are largely reflected in our guidance. Overall, First Solar supports consistent and predictable policies because it is critical to achieving sustainable markets. Reductions in subsidies are necessary to reduce speculation and to drive progress toward affordable solar electricity generation. We look forward to clarification of the policy uncertainties to be more specific. Earlier this year, the German government adopted a partial July and September pull in of the January 2012 FiT progression, the changes in trend suggest the market at about 4 gigawatts in 2011. There is potential that nuclear energy concerns may influence due to renewable policies and targets, but it's really too soon to assess the impact.
In France, the government revised the FiT program and implemented a 500-megawatt Cap on the annual market size and introduced the tender system for large projects. We are disappointed that the new decree does not provide sufficient multi-yearnings visibility and uncertainty for a sizable French PV market. The government is said to take into account the need for investors in existing projects. We're now waiting for details about the tender system before making a decision about the long-term viability of the market, and our French factory remains on indefinite hold.
Because of grandfather projects, the French market should exceed the cap in 2011 and range from 500 to 800-megawatt this year.
Italy remains unclear in regards to both an extension of the current program, CE 3, and the timing in terms of the new program, CE 4. It is clear, however, that the existing delay in fiT clarity will require a quarter or more to reach our project financing and development. Further delay in FiT details will continue to impact project realization, as well as future project planning and development. We are actively engaging in the FIT policy discussions in monitoring the situations.
As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect the European industry demand to go through a period of adjustment in the second and third quarters. However, a number of our strategies will help us mitigate these risks. First, we continue to adopt our third party module offering to levels we anticipate to drive sell through. We are extending into that 10 to 30 kilowatt European commercial rooftop segment to further diversify our business. This is enabled by our Series 3 technology and will be executed with current and new customers.
As we had in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4 gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our approximately 450-megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half and we have the flexibility to build additional 150-megawatt of systems if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC than PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline. We continue to diversify geographically and invest in market development in North America, India, Australia, the Middle East and China. We are also continuing to invest to drive for minimum LCOE and maximum energy yield.
In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to increase the RPS requirements to 33% by 2020 with compliance milestones, which establishes California as the national leader in renewable energy. We believe that California IOUs are on their way to fulfilling that 33% RPS requirements, but the final realization rate is yet to be determined which we see as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also continuing to encourage policy in those states to support the development of sustainable PV markets and we are starting to see project opportunity in other states. The DOE loan guarantee program funding was preserved in the 2011 budget negotiations and existing applications for grandfathered. It is unclear that there will be need to be to additional appropriations for lending authorities and the coveted credit subsidy fee to fund all of the existing applications. The program is important because it helps establish the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope also for the ability to place long-term on guaranteed project bonds into U.S. institutional markets.
In China, the government has recently increased its commitment to developing solar market. As part of the 12 five-year development plan, China has set a goal to install 5 gigawatt of solar by 2015 and is considering increasing to 10 gigawatts on its way to achieving that at least 20 gigawatt by 2020. In addition, the government increased its surcharge that the grid company can apply when selling power to the end consumer, which should help fund renewable programs. However, systems providers, including First Solar, need sustainable economics to drive growth and we are hopeful that a transparent and appropriately set national market support structure will be implemented. First Solar is focusing on the execution of the orders project and is actively pursuing several potential other set of project opportunities in China.
We continue to see momentum in India, driven by the National Solar Mission objective of 2 gigawatt by 2020, as well as by robust programs and stage by Gujarat. Over 1 gigawatts of PPAs has been assigned but the high cost of capital and adventure margin finance markets are possible constraints to realization. We are increasing investment in India to help the market realize its potential. We are working with a number of customers and our pipeline could result in more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to 500 to 600 megawatts in 2012.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state FiTs are growing market growth. The preferred bidders for the 400-megawatt first phase of the Solar Flagship's program are expected to be announced in Q2. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners, including 2 of the 4 shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program. The Australian market offers emerging segments such as large-scale upgrade PV installations that could replace the high cost existing diesel generation that's there.
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other countries are exploring the introduction of utility scale solar into their energy mix. The Saudi government announced the $100 billion plan to meet rising electricity demand and cut its dependence on oil which could increase from 3 million barrels per day today to 8 million barrels by 2030. Policy details are expected in the third quarter. Other Gulf countries are also putting in place support mechanisms. For example, UAE recently launched a prequalification procedure for our 100-megawatt project and Oman is expected to launch a similar process for a 200-megawatt project.
On Slide 12, we highlight the areas we are focusing on to drive predictable long-term growth to make Solar affordable. We have made progress in achieving multi-year visibility through our North American pipeline, contract and developed markets and by developing new markets. Although individual market performance may vary from time to time, our diversification strategy will enable us to maintain flexibility to respond to these changes.
We are focused on minimizing LCOE, optimizing project returns and enabling the fastest lead time to generation to drive towards great parity in the markets we serve. This will be accomplished by reducing our proprietary film module cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 by 2014 an increasing version efficiency to 13.5% to 14% by 2014. We are on plan to achieve this and have the lowest module cost in the industry today by 30% or 40%. These improvements, along with continued execution of our balance and systems roadmap, should allow us to drive pricing to great parity. First Solar's project development pipeline and EPC capability are world class and we will leverage this to provide complete low-cost application solutions as we develop new business and segments.
Over the next 3 years, we plan to execute on our 2.4 gigawatt pipeline in North America and expand it further. We expect this pipeline to support our 1 gigawatt of annual builds starting in 2012. This gives visibility to a significant portion of our planned production for the next several years.
We are increasing our investment in new market development and technologies to grow our pipelines. This includes developing new channel partners in the United States, Asia and the Middle East by leveraging our experience and technology. We are developing technology and application solutions tailored to market segments to create favorable economics and drive the transition to affordable solar electricity. Our FiT Module technology will evolve to enable us to pursue new market segments with higher efficiencies and electricity yields and with lower costs. Our almost 3 gigawatt of production capacity by the end of 2012 will support this growth.
Finally, we plan to maintain financial discipline and deliver strong predictable returns as we pursue economically sustainable markets. Our goal is to deliver an EVA of 5 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital on our projects, technology and capital investments. Our strong balance sheet will continue to enable our growth in providing competitive advantage.
Before we discuss Slide 13, I want to take a moment and thank Sonifer for contributing to the development and operational success of First Solar. And to let you know he is leaving operations in very capable hands of executives like who has been running our manufacturing plants for about 15 months. has 26 years of semiconductor manufacturing experience at Intel and Newmont has been working closely with Bruce since joining First Solar.
Slide 13 shows that our end of year capacity is now 2.8 gigawatt in 2012. We continued to execute our factory expansion plans which remain on schedule with the exception of the 2 line French factory which is on indefinite hold and has been removed from our 2012 capacity plant. We are now projecting 44 lines in total by the end of 2012, down from 46 prior.
Note that with both Vietnam and Mesa facilities, we are implementing a new strategy that involved constructing more building space than required to meet our current capacity plan. For example, the Mesa expansion is a 4-line factory, but the building show infrastructure can accommodate 10 production lines and allow for future growth. With this new strategy, additional lines can be added with shorter lead times.
To summarize, European demand has been impacted by FiT changes and uncertainty, but we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive sell through of our 2011 production. We continued to invest to develop new markets that will drive solar PV industry growth in the future. We are making progress increasing visibility through our North American pipeline, our partnerships in developed markets and by developing new markets. We are focused on executing our systems pipeline, factory expansion and cost roadmaps, and we remain committed to our mission of driving Solar PV to sustainable economics.
Before we go to the financials, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank James Zhu for serving as our interim CFO over the past few months and enabling a smooth transition with Mark Widmar. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our future and quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the four",1583,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as reallocated Module system built to meet contracted delivery schedules. Revenue recognition is expected for those volumes later in the year. Additionally, we had 7 fewer days in Q1 resulting from our adoption of the calendar fiscal year in the fourth quarter of 2010. ASPs declined slightly due to a full quarter's impact of 2011 prices which we implemented in December of 2010. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effect of increased systems revenue recognition. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 5% of net sales in the fourth quarter to 8% of net sales in the first quarter. The blended exchange rate in the first quarter increased $0.01 sequentially to $1.34 per euro while the spot rate also increased $0.01 to $1.37 per euro. The stronger euro had a minor impact on net sales as we heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 407 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven by the ramp of our factory in Malaysia, KLM 5, which reached full production by the end of the quarter. We also improved our line throughput rate to 64.1-megawatt per year. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of 7 fewer days during the quarter.
Looking at our cost per watt, our Module cost per watt in the first quarter was $0.75, flat with the prior quarter. Our core manufacturing costs per watt was also flat at $0.73. The conversion efficiency improvement and material cost savings were offset by the decrease in the number of days and by the increase in the ramp penalty as we ramped KLM 5 and qualified KLM 6.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter gross margin was 45.8%, down 290 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of the mix shift to more systems sales, as well as lower average selling prices, partially offset by the non-repeat of the Q4 Module replacement program accrual and the improvements in conversion efficiencies. Our Module gross margin was 49.7% during the quarter, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Operating expenses were down $0.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower computation expenses driven in part by the non-repeat of our fourth quarter bonus accrual increase. Information Technology, travel and other expenses also contributed to this sequential decline. These items are mostly offset by increasing R&D investments.
Looking at Slide 20. Slide 20 shows net sales and operating income turns. Operating income for the first quarter was $129.4 million compared to $165.7 million in the fourth quarter due to the decrease in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 27.2% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin relative timing of both systems revenue recognition and operating expenses. First quarter net income was $116 million or $1.33 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Looking at cash flows, in the first quarter, operating cash flow was negative $43.8 million and free cash flow was negative $275.5 million. We spent $169 million for capital expenditures and depreciation was $47.1 million. We also funded $53 million to our end-of-life recycling program for which we set aside cash once per year in the first quarter. First quarter cash flow follow the same seasonal pattern as in prior years and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, the annual bonus payout and the end-of-life recycling funding. Project assets inventories and deferred revenue grew on more construction in progress in our systems business.
Also, we invested about $15 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2010. Due to the timing of revenue, net revenue recognition for our Systems bill, we expect to consume cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of 2011. Looking at our balance sheet, overall, our balance sheet remains strong. During the first quarter, we used $401 million of cash. In addition to the items mentioned earlier, we also paid down our revolving line of credit by $100 million, bundled our recycling program as mentioned earlier, paid for our track for acquisition and increased components inventory, including strategic raw material. Debt decreased by a $106 million and our debt to equity ratio improved to 4%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We increased our spot exchange rate assumption from $1.30 to $1.35 per euro. For the second quarter, we are fully hedged at a rate of $1.34 per euro. For the full year, about 63% of our net sales and 84% of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the dollar euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $3 million and our net income guidance by about $1 million. Our Module pricing reflects expected European FiT changes in 2011 and is intended to enable sellthrough economics. We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of systems projects in North America, up from 400 megawatts in prior guidance. We retain the flexibility to increase this amount to 600 megawatts should demand in other markets fell short of current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We began shipping from Malaysia Plant 5 in the first quarter and it ramps to full production by the end of Q1. We are ramping plant 6 in the second quarter, followed by the ramp of our second German factory in the third quarter. Our capital expenditures is primarily driven by capacity expansions in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam and the U.S..
Page 24 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $15 million and the factory start up expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million, $10 million below prior guidance due to the investment hold of our French factory. Stock based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold, that is in line with the prior guidance.
GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $970 million which is slightly below our prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. We estimate the year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share to range from $9.25 to $9.75, in line with prior guidance. Capital expenditures for the year is expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D investments. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT, systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion. This is slightly below our prior guidance primarily due the timing of system related milestone payments received during the year. The annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost to capital by 5 percentage points.
Finally, Slide 25 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating income dollars through 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 on each chart, the sum of all the quarters is 100%. Note that the second quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 16% of our full year revenue guidance and approximately 9% of our full year operating income guidance. The profile is driven by the following assumptions. First, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter. The commencement of revenue recognition for Agua is one quarter later than in prior guidance, impacting the quarterly profile. This is due to the continued delays in the DOE funding. Second, factory capacity is ramping throughout 2011. Third, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Fourth, the pattern of operating expenses is lumpy. In particular, during Q2, we expect an increase in research and development associated with process improvements that will have a positive cost to impact in the mid- to long-term. We also expect an increase in SG&A as we invest in market development and due to one-time severance expense. 
Additionally, start up expenses spiked to approximately $18 million to $20 million in Q2 before moderating back to Q1 levels in the second half of 2011. Finally, we continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenue. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and we open the call for questions. Operator?"

With a lot of the changes our pending cases that are out there especially Italy, the market started out really slow in 2011 and so there's some build in channel inventory. Due to that build and the uncertainty, there's pressure on average selling prices. So I think the prices are moving faster than people expect it. So additionally, it's not just that, but it's also the financing costs are rising in Germany and elsewhere that's impacting the project economics overall. So our outlook in terms of year carries some of that lower as to the assumption and that's embedded in our guidance which is as Mark described partially offset by the FX and what we're seeing. And as we've discussed, we are going to look at what we have in our Cap to pipeline in our planning to build 450-megawatt versus the 400 we talked about before. So I would tell you that the market has been delayed, and as we said, relative to Italy, especially we saw something came up today as we were just joining the conference. We haven't had a chance to review that. But the impact of Italy has created a challenge and a delay that'll take another quarter or two, I think, to sort out once they tell us what the rules are."

So we talked about any of -- we feel we're very pleased about that opportunity. We see some opportunity in Saudi Arabia. We talked a little bit about. We didn't highlight any significant detail over the call as we went through a lot of things during the call. We feel good about Australia and what's happening there. Some of the comments that came out of China recently would reflect that there maybe good opportunities to put together a commercial business that's a viable, that's been our challenge there. So I would say that those are the differences and as we look to the market and we assess it and find there are challenges that are impacting us, we can always modify our plants on a go forward basis. So our plan is to create flexibility with our capacity."

So though each of those contracts has some range in it in terms of what you blend in terms of milestone commitments in terms of total. So that's where we can do part of that upside. In addition, there are unannounced customer projects. So customer developed projects where we would provide PPC and Module installation in total. And then also, we can -- because of our focus and effort and cycle time, we've increased our ability to put megawatts in the ground. So that also provides the flexibility and opportunity to meet customer demands and drive it that way. So I think that, that's where that range comes from and what we try to do is moderate it with the external Module demand. So we view the external Module demand as perishable. So when we want to be able to serve that demand with our customers and ensure that they can develop their applications and this gives us a buffer some of these fluctuations to take place. So that's where that comes from. And the second part of your question, can you restate?"

Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 mi",778,"Great. Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 million. The first quarter net income was $116 million or 20.4% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.33. Return on net assets was 17% on a 4-quarter rolling basis, representing an EVA of approximately 5% in line with our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance is $713 million, decreased $400 million sequentially, as we invested in CapEx and new factories, paid down $100 million of debt and began construction at several systems and system projects, as well as funded our recycling program.
The Q1 production was 407 megawatts, up 26% versus the prior year. And up 3% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by the production ramp of the KLM 5 factory and improved by conversion efficiency, partially offset by 7 fewer calendar days than in the fourth quarter. The annual capacity per line increased by 1.5-megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 64.1-megawatt. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year and in line with our roadmap. As a result of continuous improvement in efficiency and process, we recently released our series 3 85-watt module for higher efficiency applications. The module manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75 which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of increased efficiency and material cost reductions were offset by factory ramp costs and fewer calendar days. Core costs which excludes the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation was $0.73 per watt, down 9% year-over-year in line with our cost reduction roadmap.
To summarize our capacity build out, in March, we announced Mesa, Arizona as the location of our previously announced 4-line manufacturing plant in the United States with expected production ramp in the third quarter of 2012. Construction of our Vietnam site is progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012. Malaysia 5 reached full production by the end of the first quarter and Malaysia 6 is ramping in Q2 of 2011. Frankfurt Oder 2 remains on plan for third quarter ramp this year. Our 2-line factory in France remains on indefinite hold, so we have removed it from our 20 [ph] capacity plan, pending further clarity on the tender process for projects in France.
Moving to Page 7. In market development, we are focused on executing our North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. We are expanding market diversity, growing pipelines and maintaining our technology leadership and business model flexibility to increase our visibility in 2011 and beyond. In North America, we began to execute on the 450-megawatt DCs of planned 2011 systems builds, including Agua Caliente, several projects in Ontario, as well as Santa Teresa, PNM and Paloma. The Agua Caliente DOE loan guarantee is progressing, and we expect the financing to close in late Q2 or early Q3. Topaz received its final environmental impact report, and the Bureau of Land Management issued the final environmental impact statement for desert site sunlight in April.
In Europe, we're managing through a market uncertainty due to FiT and policy changes. Ambiguity about the magnitude of Germany's midyear FiT digression, lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process and Italy's delayed implementation of the new decree, all created uncertainties about project economics and financing. Industry channels are adversely impacted by the lack of transparency around pending policy revisions or contemplated FiT changes. 
We're making progress in developing the Indian, Australian and Chinese markets. Our pipeline in India has the potential to drive more than 100 megawatts of shipments in 2011, up from 10 megawatts in 2010. In China, we are discussing additional agreements with leading Chinese generating companies. We also announced that we will begin to offer our modules for installation as small as 10 kilowatts in response to customer demand, having previously limited availability to 30 kilowatt systems. About a third of our modules are currently installed on rooftops around the world and this expands our offering in this growing market segment, giving our current customers more flexibility and provides access to a new range of customers, which should further diversify our sales mix.
During Q1, we've hired a new CFO, Mark Widmar. Mark joined us in early April, and he's proving to be a quick study. Mark brings nearly 25 years of experience in finance and accounting to First Solar, his broad technology and industrial background will be an asset as we continue to scale. Mark, please say a few words"

The 20-megawatt Santa Teresa project is under construction and is our first project resulting in the conversion of a CSP site to PV, and the first to employ trackers to increase energy yield.
The next slide lists the projects in our contracted pipeline in North America. We highlighted the projects in green for which execution has begun in 2011. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts AC of PPA, EPC, on Ontario RESOP contracted projects. We plan to execute on about 450-megawatt DC with contributions from a dozen projects in 2011, up from 3 in 2010. And we currently have the flexibility to build to up to 600 megawatt DC in 2011. We expect to sign new EPC agreements to continue adding to our contracted pipeline developed by First Solar and your partners. Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for our utility scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, execution record and attractive financial profile.
Turning to Slide 11. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how this relates to First Solar's growth strategy and our investments. In Europe, Germany, France and Italy are implementing changes to their feed-in tariff structures, market caps and tender processes. The industry will require a period of adjustment and understanding of the changes, since some of the implementation details have not been finalized. In addition, the Italian government's decision-making process resulted in a market pause and excess channel inventories. Rise in European interest rates are also applying pressure to project economics. These factors create a demand, oversupply and price risks, and highlight the importance of a global market development and project pipelines, which are strengths for First Solar.
Tighter industry economics are expected in the second half of 2011, which we believe are largely reflected in our guidance. Overall, First Solar supports consistent and predictable policies because it is critical to achieving sustainable markets. Reductions in subsidies are necessary to reduce speculation and to drive progress toward affordable solar electricity generation. We look forward to clarification of the policy uncertainties to be more specific. Earlier this year, the German government adopted a partial July and September pull-in of the January 2012 FiT digression. The changes in trends suggest the market of about 4 gigawatt in 2011. There is potential that nuclear energy concerns may influence due to renewable policies and targets, but it's really too soon to assess the impact.
In France, the government revised the FiT program and implemented a 500-megawatt cap on the annual market size and introduced the tender system for large projects. We are disappointed that the new decree does not provide sufficient multi-year visibility, and certainty for a sizable French PV market. The government has sailed to take into account the needs of investors in existing projects. We're now waiting for details about the tender system before making a decision about the long-term viability of the market, and our French factory remains on indefinite hold. Because of grandfather projects, the French market should exceed the cap in 2011 and range from 500 to 800 megawatt this year. Italy remains unclear with regards to both an extension of the current program, CE 3, and the timing and terms of the new program, CE 4. It is clear, however, that the existing delay in FiT clarity will require a quarter or more to reach our project financing and development. Further delay in FiT details will continue to impact project realization, as well as future project planning and development. We are actively engaging in the FIT policy discussions and monitoring the situation.
As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect the European industry demand to go through a period of adjustment in the second and third quarters. However, a number of our strategies will help us mitigate these risks. First, we continue to adapt our third party module offering to levels we anticipate to drive sell through. We're extending into this 10 to 30 kilowatt European commercial rooftop segment to further diversify our business. This is enabled by our Series 3 technology and will be executed with current and new customers.
As we have in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4 gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our approximately 450 megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half, and we have the flexibility to build additional 150 megawatt of systems if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline. We continue to diversify geographically and invest in market development in North America, India, Australia, the Middle East and China. We are also continuing to invest to drive for minimum LCOE and maximum energy yield.
In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to increase the RPS requirements to 33% by 2020 with compliance milestones, which establishes California as the national leader in renewable energy. We believe that California IOUs are on their way to fulfilling those 33% RPS requirements, but the final realization rate is yet to be determined, which we see as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also continuing to encourage policy in those states to support the development of sustainable PV markets, and we are starting to see project opportunity in other states. The DOE loan guarantee program funding was preserved in the 2011 budget negotiations and existing applications were grandfathered. It is unclear if there will be need to be -- there will be a need to additional appropriations for lending authorities and the coveted credit subsidy fee to fund all of the existing applications. The program is important because it helps establish the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the ability to place long-term un-guaranteed project bonds into U.S. institutional market.
In China, the government has recently increased its commitment to developing the solar market. As part of the 12 5-year development plan, China has set a goal to install 5 gigawatt of solar by 2015, and is considering increasing this goal to 10 gigawatt on its way to achieving that at least 20 gigawatt by 2020. In addition, the government increased its surcharge that the grid company can apply when selling power to the end consumer, which should help fund renewable programs. However, systems providers, including First Solar, need sustainable economics to drives growth and we are hopeful that a transparent and appropriately set national market support structure will be implemented. First Solar is focusing on the execution of the Ordos project, and is actively pursuing several other potential solar project opportunities in China.
We continue to see momentum in India, driven by the National Solar Mission objective of 22 gigawatt by 2020, as well as by robust programs and states by Gujarat. Over 1 gigawatt of PPAs had been assigned, but the high cost of capital and immature margin finance markets are possible constraints to realization. We are increasing investment in India to help the market realize its potential. We are working with a number of customers and our pipeline could result in more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to 500 to 600 megawatts in 2012.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state FiTs are growing market growth. The preferred bidders for the 400-megawatt first phase of the Solar Flagship's program are expected to be announced in Q2. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including 2 of the 4 shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program. The Australian market offers emerging segments such as large-scale off-grid PV installations that could replace the high cost existing diesel generation that's there.
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other countries are exploring the introduction of utility scale solar into their energy mix. The Saudi government announced the $100 billion plan to meet rising electricity demand and cut its dependence on oil, which could increase from 3 million barrels per day today to 8 million barrels by 2030. Policy details are expected in the third quarter. Other Gulf countries are also putting in place support mechanisms. For example, UAE recently launched a prequalification procedure for our 100-megawatt project, and Oman is expected to launch a similar process for a 200-megawatt project.
On Slide 12, we highlight the areas we are focusing on to drive predictable long-term growth to make Solar affordable. We have made progress in achieving multi-year visibility through our North American pipeline, contracts in developed markets and by developing new markets. Although individual market performance may vary from time to time, our diversification strategy will enable us to maintain flexibility to respond to these changes.
We are focused on minimizing LCOE, optimizing project returns and enabling the fastest lead time to generation to drive towards grid parity in the markets we serve. This will be accomplished by reducing our proprietary thin film module cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 by 2014, and increasing version efficiency to 13 1/2% to 14% by 2014. We are on plan to achieve this and have the lowest module costs in the industry today by 30% to 40%. These improvements, along with continued execution of our balance and systems roadmap, should allow us to drive pricing to grid parity. First Solar's project development pipeline and EPC capability are world class, and we will leverage this to provide complete low-cost application solutions as we develop new business and segments.
Over the next few years, we plan to execute on our 2.4 gigawatt pipeline in North America and expand it further. We expect this pipeline to support our 1 gigawatt of annual builds starting in 2012. This gives visibility to a significant portion of our planned production for the next several years.
We are increasing our investment in new market development and technologies to grow our pipelines. This includes developing new channel partners in the United States, Asia and the Middle East by leveraging our experience and technology. We are developing technology and application solutions tailored to market segments to create favorable economics and drive the transition to affordable solar electricity. Our thin film module technology will evolve to enable us to pursue new market segments with higher efficiencies and electricity yields and with lower costs. Our almost 3 gigawatt of production capacity by the end of 2012 will support this growth.
Finally, we plan to maintain financial discipline and deliver strong predictable returns as we pursue economically sustainable markets. Our goal is to deliver EVA of 5 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital on our projects, technology and capital investments. Our strong balance sheet will continue to enable our growth and provide a competitive advantage.
Before we discuss Slide 13, I want to take a moment and thank Bruce Sohn for contributing to the development and operational success of First Solar, and to let you know he is leaving operations in the very capable hands of executives like Tymen DeJong who has been running our manufacturing plants for about 15 months. Tymen has 26 years of semiconductor manufacturing experience at Intel and Numonyx and has been working closely with Bruce since joining First Solar.
Slide 13 shows that our end-of-year capacity is now 2.8 gigawatt in 2012. We continue to execute our factory expansion plans which remain on schedule, with the exception of the 2-line French factory which is on indefinite hold and has been removed from our 2012 capacity plant. We are now projecting 44 lines in total by the end of 2012, down from 46 prior.
Note that with both the Vietnam and Mesa facilities, we are implementing a new strategy that involves constructing more building space than required to meet our current capacity plan. For example, the Mesa expansion is a 4-line factory, but the buildings show an infrastructure can accommodate 10 production lines and allow for future growth. With this new strategy, additional lines can be added with shorter lead times.
To summarize, European demand has been impacted by FiT changes and uncertainty, but we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive sell-through of our 2011 production. We continue to invest to develop new markets and will drive solar PV industry growth in the future. We are making progress increasing visibility through our North American pipeline, our partnerships in developed markets and by developing new markets. We're focused on executing our systems pipeline, factory expansion and cost roadmaps, and we remain committed to our mission of driving Solar PV to sustainable economics.
Before we go to the financials, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank James Zhu for serving as our interim CFO over the past few months and enabling a smooth transition with Mark Widmar. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our future eand quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the four",1592,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as we allocated modules to system builds to meet contracted delivery schedules. Revenue recognition is expected for those volumes later in the year. Additionally, we had 7 fewer days in Q1 resulting from our adoption of a calendar fiscal year in the fourth quarter of 2010. ASPs declined slightly due to a full quarter's impact of 2011 prices which we implemented in December of 2010. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effect of increased systems revenue recognition. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 5% of net sales in the fourth quarter to 8% of net sales in the first quarter. The blended exchange rate in the first quarter increased $0.01 sequentially to $1.34 per euro, while the spot rate also increased $0.01 to $1.37 per euro. The stronger euro had a minor impact on net sales as we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 407 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven by the ramp of our FiT factory in Malaysia, KLM 5, which reached full production by the end of the quarter. We also improved our line throughput rate to 64.1 megawatt per year. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of 7 fewer days during the quarter.
Looking at our cost per watt, our module cost per watt in the first quarter was $0.75, flat with the prior quarter. Our core manufacturing costs per watt was also flat at $0.73. The conversion efficiency improvement and material cost savings were offset by the decrease in the number of days and by the increase in the ramp penalty as we ramped KLM 5 and qualified KLM 6.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter gross margin was 45.8%, down 290 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of the mix shift to more systems sales, as well as lower average selling prices, partially offset by the non-repeat of the Q4 module replacement program accrual and the improvements in the conversion efficiencies. Our Module gross margin was 49.7% during the quarter, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Operating expenses were down $0.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower computation expenses driven in part by the non-repeat of our fourth quarter bonus accrual increase. Information Technology, Travel and other expenses also contributed to this sequential decline. These items are mostly offset by increasing R&D investments.
Looking at Slide 20. Slide 20 shows net sales and operating income turns. Operating income for the first quarter was $129.4 million compared to $165.7 million in the fourth quarter due to the decrease in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 27.2% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of both systems revenue recognition and operating expenses. First quarter net income was $116 million or $1.33 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Looking at cash flows. In the first quarter, operating cash flow was negative $43.8 million and free cash flow was negative $275.5 million. We spent $169 million for capital expenditures and depreciation was $47.1 million. We also funded $53 million to our end-of-life recycling program for which we set aside cash once per year in the first quarter. First quarter cash flow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years, and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, the annual bonus payout and the end-of-life recycling funding. Project assets inventories and deferred revenue grew on more construction in progress in our systems business.
Also, we invested about $15 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2010. Due to the timing of revenue, net revenue recognition for our systems build, we expect to consume cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of 2011. Looking at our balance sheet. Overall, our balance sheet remains strong. During the first quarter, we used $401 million of cash. In addition to the items mentioned earlier, we also paid down our revolving line of credit by $100 million, funded our recycling program as mentioned earlier, paid for our RayTracker acquisition and increased components inventory, including strategic raw material. Net debt -- excuse me, debt decreased by a $106 million and our debt to equity ratio improved to 4%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We increased our spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.35 per euro. For the second quarter, we are fully hedged at a rate of $1.34 per euro. For the full year, about 63% of our net sales and 84% of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the dollar-euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $3 million, and our net income guidance by about $1 million. Our module pricing reflect expected European FiT changes in 2011 and is intended to enable sell-through economics. We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of systems projects in North America, up from 400 megawatts in prior guidance. We retain the flexibility to increase this amount to 600 megawatts should demand in other markets fall short of current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We began shipping for Malaysia plant 5 in the first quarter and it ramped to full production by the end of Q1. We are ramping plant 6 in the second quarter, followed by the ramp of our second German factory in the third quarter. Our capital expenditures is primarily driven by capacity expansions in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam and the U.S..
Page 24 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $15 million and the factory start-up expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million, $10 million below prior guidance due to the indefinite hold of our French factory. Stock based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold that is in line with prior guidance.
GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $970 million which is slightly below prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. We estimate the year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share to range from $9.25 to $9.75, in line with prior guidance. Capital expenditures for the year is expected between -- expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion, and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D investments. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT, systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion. This is slightly below our prior guidance, primarily due to the timing of system-related milestone payments received during the year. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost to capital by 5 percentage points.
Finally, Slide 25 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating income dollars through 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 in each chart, the sum of all the quarters is 100%. Note that the second quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 16% of our full year revenue guidance and approximately 9% of our full year operating income guidance. The profile is driven by the following assumptions: First, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter. The commencement of revenue recognition for Agua is one quarter later than in prior guidance, impacting the quarterly profile. This is due to the continued delays in the DOE funding. Second, factory capacity is ramping throughout 2011. Third, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Fourth, the pattern of operating expenses is lumpy. In particular, during Q2, we expect an increase in research and development associated with process improvements that will have a positive cost-per-watt impact in the mid- to long-term. We also expect an increase in SG&A as we invest in market development and due to one-time severance expense. 
Additionally, start-up expenses spiked to approximately $18 million to $20 million in Q2 before moderating back to Q1 levels in the second half of 2011. Finally, we continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenue. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and we open the call for questions. Operator?"

I mean, with a lot of the changes or pending changes that are out there especially Italy, the market started out really slow in 2011, and so there's some build in channel inventory. Due to that build and the uncertainty, there's pressure on average selling prices. So I think prices are moving faster than people expect it. So additionally there is -- that's not just that, but it's also the financing costs are rising in Germany and elsewhere that's impacting the project economics overall. So our outlook in terms of a year carries some of that lower ASP assumption, and that's embedded in our guidance, which as Mark described partially offset by the FX and what we're seeing. And as we've discussed, we're going to look at what we have in our cap at pipeline and now are planning to build 450 megawatt versus the 400 we've talked about before. So I would tell you that the market has been delayed, and as we said, relative to Italy, especially we saw something came out today as we were just joining the conference.

And then starting in 2012, we have 1 gigawatt of installations planned on a go-forward basis on our own captive pipeline. So in general, that's a significant change for us. And then our investment in developing the new markets that we've talked about versus the traditional agreements that we have in place in developed areas of the world. So we talked about India, we feel we're very pleased about that opportunity. We see some opportunity in Saudi Arabia we talked a little bit about. We didn't highlight any significant detail over the call as we went through a lot of things during the call. We feel good about Australia and what's happening there. Some of the comments that came out of China recently would reflect that there maybe good opportunities to put together a commercial business that's viable, that's been our challenge there.

In addition, there are unannounced customer projects. So they're customer developed projects where we would provide PPC and module installation in total. And then also, we can -- because of our focus and effort in cycle time, we've increased our ability to put megawatts on the ground. So that also provides the flexibility and opportunity to meet customer demands and drive it that way. So I think that, that's where that range comes from, and what we try to do is moderate it with the external module demand. So we view the external module demand as perishable.

Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance.

We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 million. The first quarter net income was $116 million or 20.4% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.33. Return on net assets was 17% on a 4-quarter rolling basis, representing an EVA of approximately 5% in line with our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance is $713 million, decreased $400 million sequentially, as we invested in CapEx and new factories, paid down $100 million of debt and began construction at several systems and system projects, as well as funded our recycling program.
The Q1 production was 407 megawatts, up 26% versus the prior year. And up 3% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by the production ramp of the KLM 5 factory and improved by conversion efficiency, partially offset by 7 fewer calendar days than in the fourth quarter. The annual capacity per line increased by 1.5-megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 64.1-megawatt. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year and in line with our roadmap. As a result of continuous improvement in efficiency and process, we recently released our series 3, 85-watt module for higher efficiency applications. The module manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75 which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of increased efficiency and material cost reductions were offset by factory ramp costs and fewer calendar days. Core costs which excludes the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation was $0.73 per watt, down 9% year-over-year in line with our cost reduction roadmap.
To summarize our capacity build out, in March, we announced Mesa, Arizona as the location for our previously announced 4-line manufacturing plant in the United States with expected production ramp in the third quarter of 2012. Construction of our Vietnam site is progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012. Malaysia 5 reached full production by the end of the first quarter and Malaysia 6 is ramping in Q2 of 2011. Frankfurt Oder 2 remains on plan for third quarter ramp this year. Our 2-line factory in France remains on indefinite hold, so we have removed it from our 20 [ph] capacity plan, pending further clarity on the tender process for projects in France.
Moving to Page 7. In market development, we are focused on executing our North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. We are expanding market diversity, growing pipelines and maintaining our technology leadership and business model flexibility to increase our visibility in 2011 and beyond. In North America, we began to execute on the 450-megawatt DC of planned 2011 systems builds, including Agua Caliente, several projects in Ontario, as well as Santa Teresa, PNM and Paloma. The Agua Caliente DOE loan guarantee is progressing, and we expect the financing to close in late Q2 or early Q3. Topaz received its final environmental impact report, and the Bureau of Land Management issued the final environmental impact statement for desert site sunlight in April.
In Europe, we're managing through a market uncertainty due to FiT and policy changes. Ambiguity about the magnitude of Germany's midyear FiT digression, lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process and Italy's delayed implementation of the new decree, all created uncertainties about project economics and financing. Industry channels are adversely impacted by the lack of transparency around pending policy revisions or contemplated FiT changes. 
We're making progress in developing the Indian, Australian and Chinese markets. Our pipeline in India has the potential to drive more than 100 megawatts of shipments in 2011, up from 10 megawatts in 2010. In China, we are discussing additional agreements with leading Chinese generating companies. We also announced that we will begin to offer our modules for installations as small as 10 kilowatts in response to customer demand, having previously limited availability to 30 kilowatt systems. About a third of our modules are currently installed on rooftops around the world and this expands our offering in this growing market segment, giving our current customers more flexibility and provides access to a new range of customers, which should further diversify our sales mix.
During Q1, we've hired a new CFO, Mark Widmar. Mark joined us in early April, and he's proving to be a quick study. Mark brings nearly 25 years of experience in finance and accounting to First Solar. His broad technology and industrial background will be an asset as we continue to scale. Mark, please say a few words"

On Page 9, you can see some of the project type activity in the first quarter. We delivered the 5-megawatt Tilbury site to Enbridge and completed the 2-megawatt Greece [ph] project for PNM in the first quarter. Greece [ph] is the first of 5 we are building for PNM. We continued site work on Agua Caliente and we expect to begin module installation in the third quarter. The 20-megawatt Santa Teresa project is under construction and is our first project resulting in the conversion of a CSP site to PV, and the first to employ trackers to increase energy yield.
The next slide lists the projects in our contracted pipeline in North America. We highlighted the projects in green for which execution has begun in 2011. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts AC of PPA, EPC, on Ontario RESOP contracted projects. We plan to execute on about 450-megawatt DC with contributions from a dozen projects in 2011, up from 3 in 2010. And we currently have the flexibility to build to up to 600 megawatt DC in 2011. We expect to sign new EPC agreements to continue adding to our contracted pipeline developed by First Solar and our partners. Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for our utility scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, execution record and attractive financial profile.
Turning to Slide 11. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how this relates to First Solar's growth strategy and our investments. In Europe, Germany, France and Italy are implementing changes to their feed-in tariff structures, market caps and tender processes. The industry will require a period of adjustment and understanding of the changes, since some of the implementation details have not been finalized. In addition, the Italian government's decision-making process resulted in a market pause and excess channel inventories. Rise in European interest rates are also applying pressure to project economics. These factors create a demand, oversupply and price risks, and highlight the importance of a global market development and project pipelines, which are strengths for First Solar.
Tighter industry economics are expected in the second half of 2011, which we believe are largely reflected in our guidance. Overall, First Solar supports consistent and predictable policies because it is critical to achieving sustainable markets. Reductions in subsidies are necessary to reduce speculation and to drive progress toward affordable solar electricity generation. We look forward to clarification of the policy uncertainties to be more specific. Earlier this year, the German government adopted a partial July and September pull-in of the January 2012 FiT digression. The changes in trends suggest the market of about 4 gigawatt in 2011. There is potential that nuclear energy concerns may influence due to renewable policies and targets, but it's really too soon to assess the impact.
In France, the government revised the FiT program and implemented a 500-megawatt cap on the annual market size and introduced the tender system for large projects. We are disappointed that the new decree does not provide sufficient multi-year visibility and certainty for a sizable French PV market. The government has failed to take into account the needs of investors in existing projects. We're now waiting for details about the tender system before making a decision about the long-term viability of the market, and our French factory remains on indefinite hold. Because of grandfather projects, the French market should exceed the cap in 2011 and range from 500 to 800 megawatt this year. Italy remains unclear with regards to both an extension of the current program, CE 3, and the timing and terms of the new program, CE 4. It is clear, however, that the existing delay in FiT clarity will require a quarter or more to reach our project financing and development. Further delay in FiT details will continue to impact project realization, as well as future project planning and development. We are actively engaging in the FiT policy discussions and monitoring the situation.
As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect the European industry demand to go through a period of adjustment in the second and third quarters. However, a number of our strategies will help us mitigate these risks. First, we continue to adapt our third party module offering to levels we anticipate to drive sell through. We're extending into this 10 to 30 kilowatt European commercial rooftop segment to further diversify our business. This is enabled by our Series 3 technology and will be executed with current and new customers.
As we have in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4 gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our approximately 450 megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half, and we have the flexibility to build additional 150 megawatt of systems if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline. We continue to diversify geographically and invest in market development in North America, India, Australia, the Middle East and China. We are also continuing to invest to drive for minimum LCOE and maximum energy yield.
In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to increase the RPS requirements to 33% by 2020 with compliance milestones, which establishes California as the national leader in renewable energy. We believe that California IOUs are on their way to fulfilling their 33% RPS requirements, but the final realization rate is yet to be determined, which we see as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also continuing to encourage policy in those states to support the development of sustainable PV markets, and we are starting to see project opportunity in other states. The DOE loan guarantee program funding was preserved in the 2011 budget negotiations and existing applications were grandfathered. It is unclear if there will be a need to additional appropriations for lending authorities and the coveted credit subsidy fee to fund all of the existing applications. The program is important because it helps establish the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the ability to place long-term un-guaranteed project bonds into U.S. institutional market.
In China, the government has recently increased its commitment to developing the solar market. As part of the 12 5-year development plan, China has set a goal to install 5 gigawatt of solar by 2015, and is considering increasing this goal to 10 gigawatt on its way to achieving at least 20 gigawatt by 2020. In addition, the government increased its surcharge that the grid company can apply when selling power to the end consumer, which should help fund renewable programs. However, systems providers, including First Solar, need sustainable economics to drive growth and we are hopeful that a transparent and appropriately set national market support structure will be implemented. First Solar is focusing on the execution of the Ordos project, and is actively pursuing several other potential solar project opportunities in China.
We continue to see momentum in India, driven by the National Solar Mission objective of 22 gigawatt by 2020, as well as by robust programs in states like Gujarat. Over 1 gigawatt of PPAs have been assigned, but the high cost of capital and immature margin finance markets are possible constraints to realization. We are increasing investment in India to help the market realize its potential. We are working with a number of customers and our pipeline could result in more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to 500 to 600 megawatts in 2012.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state FiTs are promoting growing market growth. The preferred bidders for the 400-megawatt first phase of the Solar Flagship's program are expected to be announced in Q2. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including 2 of the 4 shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program. The Australian market offers emerging segments such as large-scale off-grid PV installations that could replace the high cost existing diesel generation that's there.
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other countries are exploring the introduction of utility scale solar into their energy mix. The Saudi government announced the $100 billion plan to meet rising electricity demand and cut its dependence on oil, which could increase from 3 million barrels per day today to 8 million barrels by 2030. Policy details are expected in the third quarter. Other Gulf countries are also putting in place support mechanisms. For example, UAE recently launched a prequalification procedure for a 100-megawatt project, and Oman is expected to launch a similar process for a 200-megawatt project.
On Slide 12, we highlight the areas we are focusing on to drive predictable long-term growth to make Solar affordable. We have made progress in achieving multi-year visibility through our North American pipeline, contracts in developed markets and by developing new markets. Although individual market performance may vary from time to time, our diversification strategy will enable us to maintain flexibility to respond to these changes.
We are focused on minimizing LCOE, optimizing project returns and enabling the fastest lead time to generation to drive towards grid parity in the markets we serve. This will be accomplished by reducing our proprietary thin film module cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 by 2014, and increasing version efficiency to 13 1/2% to 14% by 2014. We are on plan to achieve this and have the lowest module costs in the industry today by 30% to 40%. These improvements, along with continued execution of our balance and systems roadmap, should allow us to drive pricing to grid parity. First Solar's project development pipeline and EPC capability are world class, and we will leverage this to provide complete low-cost application solutions as we develop new business and segments.
Over the next few years, we plan to execute on our 2.4 gigawatt pipeline in North America and expand it further. We expect this pipeline to support our 1 gigawatt of annual builds starting in 2012. This gives visibility to a significant portion of our planned production for the next several years.
We are increasing our investment in new market development and technologies to grow our pipelines. This includes developing new channel partners in the United States, Asia and the Middle East by leveraging our experience and technology. We are developing technology and application solutions tailored to market segments to create favorable economics and drive the transition to affordable solar electricity. Our thin film module technology will evolve to enable us to pursue new market segments with higher efficiencies and electricity yields and with lower costs. Our almost 3 gigawatt of production capacity by the end of 2012 will support this growth.
Finally, we plan to maintain financial discipline and deliver strong predictable returns as we pursue economically sustainable markets. Our goal is to deliver an EVA of 5 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital on our projects, technology and capital investments. Our strong balance sheet will continue to enable our growth and provide a competitive advantage.
Before we discuss Slide 13, I want to take a moment and thank Bruce Sohn for contributing to the development and operational success of First Solar, and to let you know he is leaving operations in the very capable hands of executives like Tymen DeJong who has been running our manufacturing plants for about 15 months. Tymen has 26 years of semiconductor manufacturing experience at Intel and Numonyx and has been working closely with Bruce since joining First Solar.
Slide 13 shows that our end-of-year capacity is now 2.8 gigawatt in 2012. We continue to execute our factory expansion plans which remain on schedule, with the exception of the 2-line French factory which is on indefinite hold and has been removed from our 2012 capacity plant. We are now projecting 44 lines in total by the end of 2012, down from 46 prior.
Note that with both the Vietnam and Mesa facilities, we are implementing a new strategy that involves constructing more building space than required to meet our current capacity plan. For example, the Mesa expansion is a 4-line factory, but the buildings show an infrastructure can accommodate 10 production lines and allow for future growth. With this new strategy, additional lines can be added with shorter lead times.
To summarize, European demand has been impacted by FiT changes and uncertainty, but we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive sell-through of our 2011 production. We continue to invest to develop new markets and will drive solar PV industry growth in the future. We are making progress increasing visibility through our North American pipeline, our partnerships in developed markets and by developing new markets. We're focused on executing our systems pipeline, factory expansion and cost roadmaps, and we remain committed to our mission of driving Solar PV to sustainable economics.
Before we go to the financials, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank James Zhu for serving as our interim CFO over the past few months and enabling a smooth transition to Mark Widmar. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our future quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the four",1589,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as we allocated modules to system builds to meet contracted delivery schedules. Revenue recognition is expected for those volumes later in the year. Additionally, we had 7 fewer days in Q1 resulting from our adoption of a calendar fiscal year in the fourth quarter of 2010. ASPs declined slightly due to a full quarter's impact of 2011 prices which we implemented in December of 2010. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effect of increased systems revenue recognition. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 5% of net sales in the fourth quarter to 8% of net sales in the first quarter. The blended exchange rate in the first quarter increased $0.01 sequentially to $1.34 per euro, while the spot rate also increased $0.01 to $1.37 per euro. The stronger euro had a minor impact on net sales as we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 407 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven by the ramp of our FiT factory in Malaysia, KLM 5, which reached full production by the end of the quarter. We also improved our line throughput rate to 64.1 megawatt per year. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of 7 fewer days during the quarter.
Looking at our cost per watt, our module cost per watt in the first quarter was $0.75, flat with the prior quarter. Our core manufacturing costs per watt was also flat at $0.73. The conversion efficiency improvement and material cost savings were offset by the decrease in the number of days and by the increase in the ramp penalty as we ramped KLM 5 and qualified KLM 6.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter gross margin was 45.8%, down 290 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of the mix shift to more systems sales, as well as lower average selling prices, partially offset by the non-repeat of the Q4 module replacement program accrual and the improvements in the conversion efficiencies. Our Module gross margin was 49.7% during the quarter, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Operating expenses were down $0.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower compensation expenses driven in part by the non-repeat of our fourth quarter bonus accrual increase. Information Technology, Travel and other expenses also contributed to this sequential decline. These items are mostly offset by increasing R&D investments.
Looking at Slide 20. Slide 20 shows net sales and operating income churns. Operating income for the first quarter was $129.4 million compared to $165.7 million in the fourth quarter due to the decrease in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 27.2% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of both systems revenue recognition and operating expenses. First quarter net income was $116 million or $1.33 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Looking at cash flows. In the first quarter, operating cash flow was negative $43.8 million and free cash flow was negative $275.5 million. We spent $169 million for capital expenditures and depreciation was $47.1 million. We also funded $63 million to our end-of-life recycling program for which we set aside cash once per year in the first quarter. First quarter cash flow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years, and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, the annual bonus payout and the end-of-life recycling funding. Project assets inventories and deferred revenue grew on more construction in progress in our systems business.
Also, we invested about $50 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2010. Due to the timing of revenue, net revenue recognition for our systems build, we expect to consume cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of 2011. Looking at our balance sheet. Overall, our balance sheet remains strong. During the first quarter, we used $401 million of cash. In addition to the items mentioned earlier, we also paid down our revolving line of credit by $100 million, funded our recycling program as mentioned earlier, paid for our RayTracker acquisition and increased components inventory, including strategic raw material. Net debt -- excuse me, debt decreased by a $106 million and our debt to equity ratio improved to 4%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We increased our spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.35 per euro. For the second quarter, we are fully hedged at a rate of $1.34 per euro. For the full year, about 63% of our net sales and 84% of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the dollar-euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $3 million, and our net income guidance by about $1 million. Our module pricing reflect expected European FiT changes in 2011 and is intended to enable sell-through economics. We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of systems projects in North America, up from 400 megawatts in prior guidance. We retain the flexibility to increase this amount to 600 megawatts should demand in other markets fall short of current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We began shipping from Malaysia plant 5 in the first quarter and it ramped to full production by the end of Q1. We are ramping plant 6 in the second quarter, followed by the ramp of our second German factory in the third quarter. Our capital expenditures is primarily driven by capacity expansions in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam and the U.S.
Page 24 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $15 million and the factory start-up expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million, $10 million below prior guidance due to the indefinite hold of our French factory. Stock based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold. That is in line with prior guidance.
GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $970 million which is slightly below prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. We estimate the year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share to range from $9.25 to $9.75, in line with prior guidance. Capital expenditures for the year is expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion, and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D investments. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT, systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion. This is slightly below our prior guidance, primarily due to the timing of system-related milestone payments received during the year. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost to capital by 5 percentage points.
Finally, Slide 25 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating income dollars through 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 in each chart, the sum of all the quarters is 100%. Note that the second quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 16% of our full year revenue guidance and approximately 9% of our full year operating income guidance. The profile is driven by the following assumptions: First, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter. The commencement of revenue recognition for Agua is one quarter later than in prior guidance, impacting the quarterly profile. This is due to the continued delays in the DOE funding. Second, factory capacity is ramping throughout 2011. Third, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Fourth, the pattern of operating expenses is lumpy. In particular, during Q2, we expect an increase in research and development associated with process improvements that will have a positive cost-per-watt impact in the mid- to long-term. We also expect an increase in SG&A as we invest in market development and due to one-time severance expense. 
Additionally, start-up expenses spiked to approximately $18 million to $20 million in Q2 before moderating back to Q1 levels in the second half of 2011. Finally, we continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenue. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and we open the call for questions. Operator?"

We saw a inventory build there during the quarter which about almost 1/2 -- a little over 1/2 of the related in the systems business. We did see a little bit of inventory build, though, as well as we were ramping up KLM and our plants in Germany, which drove a little bit of additional inventory, as well as we increased our investment in strategic inventory that we currently are carrying on the book. The systems-related business will obviously follow the revenue recognition, so I would not anticipate a dramatic change in the inventory profile until we see the second half of the year."

As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but on our execution service well in and we're positioned for a significant and better second half.Startin",2570,"Thanks, Larry. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but on our execution service well in and we're positioned for a significant and better second half.
Starting with Slide 6. Q2 net sales of $533 million, that's about 6% lower than last quarter, primarily due to lower average selling prices. Solar PV power uncertainties in Italy, Germany and France adversely impacted demand in the second quarter. Net sales are also impacted as the reallocated modules for systems business which we did not recognize as revenue within the quarter.
Second quarter net income was $61 million or 11.5% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.70. Return on net assets was 13.1% on a 4-quarter rolling basis representing an EVA of about 1.1%. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $515 million declined $198 million sequentially as we invested CapEx for new factories and continued construction of several systems projects.
In addition, shipments were weighted to the end of the quarter as customers delayed orders until the European policy changes were better understood.
Despite the challenging European market in the first half of the year, our 2011 outlook remains solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. We expect significantly better performance in the remainder of 2011 as we build project from our systems pipeline, developed promising new markets and execute our cost and efficiency roadmaps. As a result, our updated 2011 EPS guidance is $9 to $9.50 for fully diluted share which includes 450 megawatts of system sales and some updated assumptions which Mark will discuss later.
Significant drivers in the change of the 2% increase in the effective tax rate were about $0.20 per share reduction, driven by the increased of profits in the U.S.
Moving on now to operations. Q2 production was 483 megawatts, up 40% versus the prior year and up 19% quarter-over-quarter. It's sequential increase is driven by the production ramp of the KLM 6 factory and early start up of Frankfurt/Oder 2. Module revenue shipments were up 6% quarter-over-quarter which partially offset the decline in average selling prices. A portion of the incremental production also went into systems project construction for which revenue was not has not yet been recognized. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.5 percentage points year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Module manufacturing and cost per watt was $0.75, which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of our modules from low-cost manufacturing sites was offset by FX, lower line throughput, higher spending and factory ramp costs. Coal costs which included the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, were $0.73 per watt. And we're very pleased to announce that our Malaysian plant have achieved a new core cost milestone of $0.69 per watt.
Annual capacity per line decreased by 2 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.1-megawatt per line. Line throughput and cost per watt were both impacted this quarter as we decided to take advantage of softer industry demand with scheduled downtime and begin to implement conversion efficiency improvements which we expect will have a meaningful impact by the end of the year.
We also reached a milestone with our standard utility-scale balance of systems by achieving a cost level of $0.99 per watt. BoS is down 29% from the second quarter of 2009. We are now also close to our 2014 target for standard BoS of $0.91 to $0.98 per watt and can improve further as our plan Module efficiencies increase from 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. This major accomplishment is the result of our experienced investment in engineering and R&D and cycles of learning from almost 400 megawatts of DC of projects built to date.
To summarize our manufacturing capacity addition, Malaysia 5 and 6 are at full production; order 2 begin ramping a month early and is expected to be at full production by the end of the third quarter. Construction of our Mesa, Arizona and Vietnam sites are progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving now to Page 7. Despite the recent market turbulence, our growth strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on our mission of making solar affordable and sustainable to gain access to the multi-terawatt peak electricity generation market. We are currently in the transition phase as fits and other government policies are progressing towards parity and market diversification continues. First Solar has made significant progress reducing a levelized cost of electricity, diversifying geographically, and we expect price declines to continue to drive demand elasticity.
On the next page, you can see we've made significant progress in lowering our total systems caused by 30% in 3 years. We can reduce debt by another 19%, we believe that we can provide turnkey utility-scale systems that generate power at an LCOE of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour and higher ratings those like the U.S. Southwest, India, China, Australia, the Middle East, Spain and Italy. This is what will drive our participation in the peak electricity generation market.
Now turning to Page 9. Our Module manufacturing cost a steadily declined since 2008 and improvements to our year-end 2014 target are primarily driven by conversion efficiency growth, 13.5% to 14.5% efficiency and annual line throughput improvements to 80-megawatt per line. We are committed to our long-term Module conversion efficiency roadmap and we invest heavily in technology to achieve this end. Our investments in technology are not focused on hero cells. We emphasize track improvements with the low-cost pathways to implementation and production. However, it is nice to see that when we integrate several of these improvements, we are able to deliver a device that does exceed that has exceeded prior world record. We recently received confirmation from an Roe that first solar cells achieved a record 17.3% efficiency for CDT udenafil which breaks the previous record of 16.7% which was set in 2001.
Unlike other sell records, the cell was constructed using only full-scale manufacturing processes and commercial materials. Therefore, we believe they can be reproduced economically. This is an important milestone because it validates our technology capabilities and significantly through CDT thin film efficiencies and it provides confidence and improvements to the flat over the next 2 years. Our achievement is a direct result of our industry-leading annual investment in research and development, and the efforts of the committed team that you see here. We are considering approaches to accelerate Module efficiency quicker than our prime roadmap of the 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014 to support rooftop and other high-efficiency applications.
The next page shows how we have been steadily diversifying geographically and investing in market development. Our North American business has grown from 17% to 25% of megawatt shift and is expected to be our number 1 market in 2012. In India, supportive policies and new local partners are driving strong growth and we expect India to account for more than 10% of our megawatts this year. Our North American pipeline and new markets like India are helping to offset European market uncertainties and both are expected to be multi-gigawatt sustainable markets.
In the second quarter, North America and India combined represented almost 50% of our revenues.
Moving to Page 11. The market development we're focused on executing on North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. In North America, we made progress executing on the 450-megawatt DC of plant 2011 systems built and have flexibility to build up to 500 megawatts. Agua Caliente now has a significant portion of the BoS completed and we have begun installing modules. The sale of Agua Caliente to NRG and the closing of the debt financing including the BOE loan guarantee are expected soon. All major steps have been completed and we are in the funding stage. We will begin to recognize the revenue for the construction of this 290-megawatt AC system in Q3. When completed, it will be more than 3x larger than any PV power plant currently operating.
We are focused on adding to our systems pipeline on a global basis through new RPs, EPC agreements and acquisitions. For example, we recently added 150-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with Sanford Generation for the Copper Mountain 2 in Boulder Citi, Nevada. This growth to our systems pipelines about 2.6 gigawatts. Sunlight, Topaz and AVSR1 achieved $4.5 billion of DOE loans, conditional commitments in Q2. Topaz received its conditional use permit and is in the legal appeal period. AVSR is expected to begin construction in the third quarter. In Europe, we are managing through market uncertainty due to feed-in tariff and policy changes. The delayed implementation of a new decree in Italy, the slow start to Germany after January FiT reductions and lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process contributed to excess channel inventories for the industry.
During the second quarter, we work with customers to enable discrete project realization and we increased rebates to enable distributors to sell-through. In France, First Solar and our partners are realizing 250 megawatts of projects in 2011. Now we have a clearer picture in Italy, Germany, France and the U.K., but the new policies have created a more challenging operating environment.
We are making progress in developing new markets. Our 2011 plant shipments in India have now grown to more than 200 megawatts, which is up from 100 megawatts in Q1 and 10-megawatt sold in 2010. We recently signed 4 new Module customers in India and have contracted more than 250 megawatts year-to-date for deliveries in 2011 and into 2012. We are seeing an increasing number of tenders as well in the Middle East for 2012 and beyond.
On Page 12, this is the latest analyst consensus forecast of global PV market demand. On average, the FiT analyst included in the survey estimates that the 2011 market will grow to 19.8 gigawatts, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America, Italy, India and China. The analyst estimates estimate a compound growth rate of 12% from 2010  to 2013 as the markets diversified in North America, India, China, Japan, the Middle East and the rest of the world beyond Europe. Government policies, lower pricing, stellar resource and economics are driving market diversification and demand elasticity. These markets have transitioned into stable markets as we anticipated in our growth strategy.
In general, we believe demand in the major markets will improve in the second half of 2011 after a difficult first half. We see a significant growth opportunities long-term as new markets are emerging and we advance towards good parity. The German market is recovering from a slow start and appears to be ramping towards around 4 to 5 gigawatt in 2011. The recent EEG decision provides good long-term visibility and we our well-positioned at the german manufacturer.
In Italy, the market is adjusting to the new CE4 published in May is recovering from a power interruption in the first half. Demand is improving and is expected to be 2 to 3 gigawatts in 2011. Stable and reliable regular utility frameworks will be the key elements for long-term sustainable development of the Italian market. First Solar technology and Europe manufacturing expansion will help to position us for success in the Italian market.
France's policy does not provide sufficient long-term visibility at the moment while we continue to be optimistic about the longer-term opportunity. In the short-term, due to building grandfather projects, the French market should range from 500 to 800 megawatts. Our 2 line facility at Blanquefort remains on indefinite hold.
The North American market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California, over 1 gigawatt of RFOs were issued for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. Overtime, the requirement for government subsidies may decline as ROEs or early adopters do the same.
In China, the government is in the process of developing a longer-term plan for the market. With the potential to increase their 2020 goal from 20 to 50 gigawatts. China recently announced the new national FiT with the potential to provide sustainable economics by 1.15 RMB per kilowatthour. We continued to see strong momentum in India, the market is expected to grow to about 500 megawatts in 2011.
Now Australia, we were unfortunately, not selected for the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program but remained well-positioned for the second phase. Solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced National Carbon legislation, which has committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind large scale renewables and to the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility-scale projects.
In Southeast Asia, we see encouraging signs of early-stage development in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we see great potential in the Middle East. There are challenges facing oil supporting countries with the rapid growth in domestic energy needs, tenders for utility-scale projects are underway and we expect to achieve more robust renewable policies that could drive several hundred megawatt markets in just a few years.
On the next page, you can see how we've grown our systems pipeline over time. We signed a 150-megawatt AC EPC agreement with Sanford Generation for the expansion of Copper Mountain in Boulder Citi, Nevada. This site was originally developed by First Solar and sold to Sempra, which is ion PPA with PG&E for the electricity generated at Copper Mountain 2. Our goal is to continue to replace current year construction with new PPA or EPC agreements to continue to grow our pipeline.
The orange line shows our increasing project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008, to the plan 450 megawatts in 2011, and we expect to build 1 gigawatt in 2012. The slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of our Utility Systems customer base, including IPPs, utilities, and financial investors. In the back of this presentation, Slide 23 shows the details of the North American contracted project we are executing and have under development.
On Page 14, you can see some of the project activity in the second quarter. We now have completed a significant portion of the Mott’s instruction on Agua Caliente and have begun Module installation. and The Santa Teresa projects are nearly completed, and Paloma and PNM projects are ahead of schedule.
To summarize, we continued to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market and remain focused on achieving our mission. Our visibility is improving for the second half of the year, an increasing portion of our revenues and profits are under our control as we construct our systems pipeline and continue to diversify geographically. Our LCOE is approaching grid parity which should drive elasticity and demand and a growth of sustainable markets. We are investing for growth in the United States, India, the Middle East, Australia and China. We are executing a systems pipeline and we are adding to it. We continue to expand our factories and drive our product roadmaps. We achieved a major BoS and Module efficiency and also as a result of our investment in R&D in our continuous improvement processes and we have the financial strength to continue investing in the long-term future of our business.
Finally, our 2011 guidance is solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Looking at Slide 17, our net sales for the second quarter were $533 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs which were down 13% quarter-over-quarter as the reduce",1271,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking at Slide 17, our net sales for the second quarter were $533 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs which were down 13% quarter-over-quarter as the reduce prices to sell-throughs. As Rob said earlier, the quarter started slowly due to the European policy uncertainties which adversely impacted demand for the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effects of increased systems revenue recognition driven by Santa Teresa, Paloma and PMA. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 8% of total net sales in the first quarter through 11% of net sales in the second quarter. We also increased the Module allocation for the systems business during the quarter and contracted delivery schedules which resulted in revenue recognition of the second half of the year.
The early increase from Q2 to Q1, however, the stronger euro had a minor negative impact on net sales as were significant hedged in line with our long-term strategy. Gross margin was 36.6%, down 9.2 percentage points from the prior quarter. The decline was the result of the ASPs decreases, a mix shift both geographically and to more system sales and an unfavorable OpEx impact. Module gross margin was 40.2%, down 9.5 percentage points from the prior quarter. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter. Slightly higher R&D expenses associated with efficiency improvements were offset by lower production start up costs as Frankfurt/Oder and Malaysia ramped. SG&A was flat quarter-over-quarter. We saw managing an expense growth to help partially offset lower gross margin.
Operating income was $65 million compared to $129 million in the first quarter. The decline was due to the decrease in total net sales and gross margins. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.1% compared to 22.8% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of the systems revenue recognition. Second quarter net income was $61 million or $0.70 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate grows 2.2 percentage points to 15% due to the mixed shift of profits to higher tax jurisdictions which lowered EPS by $0.02 in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were down quarter-over-quarter with $515 million. Accounts receivable trade balance rose quarter-over-quarter due to the nominal shipments as policy changes in Europe pushed our customers orders to the back half of the quarter. Accounts receivable non-build increased because of growth in North America business and the timing of project billing cycle providing customer contracts. Inventories increased as we increase production from a KLM 6 and FFO2 and due to more Module balance systems materials in transit EPC installations in the third quarter. Project assets rose as we continue to develop North America project sites. We continue to invest to increase our factory capacity and we have the long-term bits to help finance Malaysia and German expansions.
Operating cash flow was negative $203 million and free cash flow was negative $408 million. We spent $221 million of capital expenditures and depreciation was $54 million. Cash flow was impacted by accounts receivable linearity, growth in project assets and inventory and deferred revenue growth on more construction in progress in our systems business. Also, we invested about $52 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2011.
As expected, we consumed cash in the first half of the year and planned to generate cash in the second half of 2011 as we complete the sales projects in our systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to equity ratio of 10%. This brings to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. Our stock exchange rate assumption of $1.40 per euro. For the third quarter, about 69% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged in an average rate of $1.34 per euro. For the balance of the year, about 72% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged in an average rate of $1.35 per euro. As of today, a 1 cent change in the euro dollar stock exchange rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and will not change our net income guidance since we are fully hedged for 2011. Our Module pricing reflects European FiT changes in 2011 it is embedded to enable sell-through economics and is based on our estimate of the current competitive market.
We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of systems projects in North America. We have the flexibility to increase this amount to 500-megawatt should the demand in other markets fell short of our current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progressed through the year.
We plan to minimize our expense growth in the second half of 2011. Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 are fully ramped and we are ramping that flow-through in Q3. Our capital expenditures is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam and the U.S..
Page 20 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. The new factory ramp cost of goods sold will range from $8 million to $10 million. And the factory start up expenses will range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be $115 million to $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to the cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $960 million which is slightly below our prior guidance at the high end of the range. Our revised effective tax rate will be 13% to 15% as more profit is recognized in higher tax locations. The 2% increase from prior guidance reduces EPS by about $0.20. Year-end 2011 fully diluted share count is expected to be 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to range from $9 to $9.50, $0.25 lower than prior guidance as we reflect the higher tax rate and a more aggressive pricing environment. We offset a portion of this by holding expenses flat. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $800 million to $900 million. Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $500 million to $600 million. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 5%.
Finally, Slide 21 is an updated of the expected quarterly profile of revenue and operating income dollars throughout 2011. Please note that as you read it horizontally from Q1 to Q4 on each chart, that sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that the third quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 28% of our full year revenue and approximately 30% of our operating income guidance. The profile was driven by the following assumption.
First, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter. Second, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting showed revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Third, we have significant operating expense leverage in the second half. There's both and expenses but we'll continue to focus on R&D and market development. Additionally, start up expenses declined to about $8 million per quarter for Mesa and Vietnam. Finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator?"

SBC, testing ramp, insurance another production costs and things like that. So ballpark on a comparative basis if you look at our cost per watt on the same basis it's about $0.68 in that range would be the equivalent comparison. And one of the things that I don't know maybe didn't come out during the presentation as well is, that we this year have changed somewhat how implement some of the changes with manufacturing team and we made the decision based on megawatts produced on a full year basis on line to take lines down for more extended periods. So say a week at a time whereas before would've done it piece to keep the lines up and running. And the reason we did that was twofold. So one is, the market conditions and the challenges in volume created an opportunity for it. And 2, we feel like for the total year, off of the same lines, we'll able to produce more megawatts. So it's kind of back to where we were I think last year, about this time where we talked about with all these lines we have and the Copy Smart approach, how do we change and make the changes appropriately and continue to bring the cost down? So we have a more of a stair step type of approach versus the incremental change quarter-over-quarter and that's really what we've been working on a part of what you're seeing. So it's still down year-over-year, but it's something that it takes more significant effort with all the lines that we have and some of the changes that we're making these we'll see the benefits of the change and effort we've made in Q4 of this year, both in the inefficiencies and line run rate.

We don't talk specifically about ASP  because we try to manage our customers and position in the market by providing and driving sellthroughs. So we want our customers to develop captive projects in the pipeline so we need to have some visibility about a year or so to do that. So what happened in Q2 and really in the first half is, that a lot of excess inventory in the system with the demand kind of stalling because of all the things we talked about earlier in the presentation. And when that happens, it puts a lot of pressure on the price aside and we work for rebate system with our customers to fund them and support them so the price pressure in external market is high from a third-party sales standpoint and that's part of what impacted our Q2 results. So we continue to manage and monitor that. We still feel confident in the concept and our approach to being able to buffer some of those fluctuations with our captive pipeline. And as we get near and nearer having those things finalized and funded especially here in the second half, as you said, Agua will start to recognize revenue on in Q3.

As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but our business model and our execution served us well and we're positioned for a significant and be",2584,"Great. Thanks, Larry. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but our business model and our execution served us well and we're positioned for a significant and better second half.
Starting with Slide 6. Q2 net sales of $533 million, that is about 6% lower than last quarter, primarily due to lower average selling prices. Solar PV's policy incentives in Italy, Germany and France adversely impacted demand in the second quarter. Net sales are also impacted as we reallocated modules to the systems business which we did not recognize as revenue within the quarter.
Second quarter net income was $61 million or 11.5% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.70. Return on net assets was 13.1% on a 4-quarter rolling basis representing an EVA of about 1.1%. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $515 million declined $198 million sequentially as we invested CapEx for new factories and continued construction in several systems projects.
In addition, shipments were weighted to the end of the quarter as customers delayed orders until the European policy changes were better understood.
Despite the challenging European market in the first half of the year, our 2011 outlook remains solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. We expect significantly better performance in the remainder of 2011 as we build projects from our systems pipeline, develop promising new markets and execute our cost and efficiency roadmaps. As a result, our updated 2011 EPS guidance is $9 to $9.50 for fully diluted share which includes 450 megawatts of system sales and some updated assumptions which Mark will discuss later. Significant drivers in the change is the 2% increase in the effective tax rate or about $0.20 per share reduction, driven by the increased portion of profits in the U.S.
Moving on now to operations. Q2 production was 483 megawatts, up 40% versus the prior year and up 19% quarter-over-quarter. This sequential increase is driven by the production ramp of the KLM 6 factory and early start up of Frankfurt-Oder 2. Module revenue shipments were up 6% quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in average selling prices. A portion of its incremental production also went to systems project construction for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.5 percentage points year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Module manufacturing and cost per watt was $0.75, which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of our modules from low-cost manufacturing sites was offset by FX, lower line throughput, higher spending and factory ramp costs. Core cost which excluded the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, were $0.73 per watt. And we're very pleased to announce that our Malaysian plant have achieved a new core cost milestone of $0.69 per watt.
Annual capacity per line decreased by 2 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.1-megawatt per line. Line throughput and cost per watt were both impacted this quarter as we decided to take advantage of softer industry demand, scheduled downtime and begin to implement conversion efficiency improvements which we expect will have a meaningful impact by the end of the year.
We also reached a milestone with our standard utility-scale Balance of Systems by achieving a cost level of $0.99 per watt. BoS is down 29% from the second quarter of 2009. We are now also close to our 2014 target for standard BoS of $0.91 to $0.98 per watt and can improve further as our planned module efficiencies increase from 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. This major accomplishment is the result of our experience in positioning, investment in engineering and R&D, and cycles of learning from almost 400 megawatts of DC of projects built to-date.
To summarize our manufacturing capacity addition, Malaysia 5 and 6 are at full production; Frankfurt-Oder 2 began ramping a month early and is expected to be at full production by the end of the third quarter. Construction of our Mesa, Arizona and Vietnam sites are progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving now to Page 7. Despite the recent market turbulence, our growth strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on our mission of making solar affordable and sustainable to gain access to the multi-terawatt peak electricity generation market. We are currently in the transition phase as FiTs and other government policies are progressing towards a parity and market diversification continues. First Solar has made significant progress reducing a levelized cost of electricity, diversifying geographically, and we expect price declines to continue to drive demand elasticity.
On the next page, you can see we've made significant progress in lowering our total systems cuts by 30% in 3 years. We can reduce that by another 19%, we believe that we can provide turnkey utility-scale systems that generate power at an LCOE of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour in high radiant zones like the U.S. Southwest, India, China, Australia, the Middle East, Spain and Italy. This is what will drive our participation in the peak electricity generation market.
Now turning to Page 9. Our Module manufacturing cost, as you noticed, steadily declined since 2008 and future improvements to our year-end 2014 target are primarily driven by conversion efficiency growth, 13.5% to 14.5% efficiency and annual line throughput improvements to 80-megawatt per line. We are committed to our long-term Module conversion efficiency roadmap and we invest heavily in technology to achieve this end. Our investments in technology are not focused on hero cells. We emphasize practical improvements with the low-cost pathways to implementation and production. However, it is nice to see that when we integrate several of these improvements, we are able to deliver a device that does exceed the prior world record. We recently received a confirmation from NREL that First Solar's cells achieved a record 17.3% efficiency for CdTe thin-film cell which breaks the previous record of 16.7% which was set in 2001.
Unlike other cell records, this cell was constructed using only full-scale manufacturing processes and commercial materials. Therefore, we believe they can be reproduced economically. This is an important milestone because it validates our technology capabilities and significantly improves CdTe thin-film efficiencies and it provides confidence in the improvements we have planned over the next few years. Our achievement is a direct result of our industry-leading annual investment in research and development, and the efforts of the committed team that you see here. We are considering approaches to accelerate Module efficiency quicker than our curent roadmap of the 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014 to support rooftop and other high-efficiency applications.
The next page shows how we have been steadily diversifying geographically and investing in market development. Our North American business has grown from 17% to 25% of megawatt shift and is expected to be our number 1 market in 2012. In India, supportive policies and new local partners are driving strong growth and we expect India to account for more than 10% of our megawatts this year. Our North American pipeline and new markets like India are helping to offset European market uncertainties and both are expected to be multi-gigawatt sustainable markets. In the second quarter, North America and India combined, represented almost 50% of our revenues.
Moving to Page 11. The market development we're focused on executing on North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. In North America, we made progress executing on the 450-megawatt DC of plant 2011 systems build and have flexibility to build up to 500 megawatts. Agua Caliente now has a significant portion of the BoS completed and we have begun installing modules. The sale of Agua Caliente to NRG and the closing of the debt financing including the DOE loan guarantee are expected soon. All major steps have been completed and we are in the funding stage. We will begin to recognize the revenue for the construction of this 290-megawatt AC system in Q3. When completed, it will be more than 3x larger than any PV power plant currently operating.
We are focused on adding to our systems pipeline on a global basis through new RFPs, EPC agreements and acquisitions. For example, we recently added 150-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with Sempra Generation for Copper Mountain 2 in Boulder City, Nevada. This growth to our systems pipelines is about 2.6 gigawatts. Sunlight, Topaz and AVSR1 achieved $4.5 billion of DOE loans, conditional commitments in Q2. Topaz received its conditional use permit and is in the legal appeal period. AVSR is expected to begin construction in the third quarter. In Europe, we are managing through market uncertainty due to feed-in tariff and policy changes. The delayed implementation of a new decree in Italy, the slow start to Germany after January FiT reductions and lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process contributed to excess channel inventories for the industry.
During the second quarter, we worked with customers to enable discrete project realization and we increased rebates to enable distributors to sell-through. In France, First Solar and our partners are realizing 250 megawatts of projects in 2011. Now we have a clearer picture in Italy, Germany, France and the U.K., but the new policies have created a more challenging operating environment.
We are making progress in developing new markets. Our 2011 plant shipments in India have now grown to more than 200 megawatts, which is up from 100 megawatts in Q1 and 10 megawatts sold in 2010. We recently signed 4 new Module customers in India and have contracted more than 250 megawatts year-to-date for deliveries in 2011 and into 2012. We are seeing an increasing number of tenders as well in the Middle East for 2012 and beyond.
On Page 12, this is the latest analyst consensus forecast of global PV market demand. On average, the 15 analysts included in this survey estimate that the 2011 market will grow to 19.8 gigawatts, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America, Italy, India and China. The analysts estimates estimate a compound growth rate of 12% from 2010  to 2013 as the markets diversified in North America, India, China, Japan, the Middle East and the rest of the world beyond Europe. Government policies, lower pricing, stellar resource and economics are driving market diversification and demand elasticity. These markets are transitioned into sustainable markets as we anticipated in our growth strategy.
In general, we believe demand in the major solar markets will improve in the second half of 2011 after a difficult first half. We see significant growth opportunities long-term as new markets are emerging and we advance towards group parity. The German market is recovering from a slow start and appears to be ramping towards around 4 to 5 gigawatt in 2011. The recent EEG decision provides good long-term visibility and we our well positioned as at the German manufacturer.
In Italy, the market is adjusting to the new CE4 [ph] published in May and is recovering from the policy interruption in the first half. Demand is improving and is expected to be 2 to 3 gigawatts in 2011. Stable and reliable regular utility frameworks will be the key elements for long-term sustainable development of the Italian market. First Solar technology and Europe manufacturing expansion will help to position us for success in the Italian market.
France's policy does not provide sufficient long-term visibility at the moment while we continue to be optimistic about the longer-term opportunity. In the short-term, due to building grandfather projects, the French market should range from 500 to 800 megawatts. Our 2-line facility planned for Blanquefort remains on indefinite hold.
The North American market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California, over 1 gigawatt of RFOs were issued for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. Overtime, the requirement for government subsidies may decline as ROEs or early adopters do the same.
In China, the government is in the process of developing a longer-term plan for the market. With the potential to increase their 2020 goal from 20 to 50 gigawatts. China recently announced the new national FiT with the potential to provide sustainable economics at 1.15 RMB per kilowatt hour. We continue to see strong momentum in India, the market is expected to grow to about 500 megawatts in 2011.
In Australia, we were unfortunately, not selected for the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program but remained well-positioned for the second phase. Solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced national carbon legislation, which has committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind large scale renewables and to the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility-scale projects.
In Southeast Asia, we see encouraging signs of early-stage development in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we see great potential in the Middle East. There are challenges facing oil-exporting countries with the rapid growth in domestic energy needs, tam tenders for utility-scale projects are underway and we expect to see more robust renewable policies that could drive a several-hundred-megawatt market in just a few years.
On the next page, you can see how we've grown our systems pipeline over time. We signed a 150-megawatt AC EPC agreement with Sempra Generation for the expansion of Copper Mountain in Boulder City, Nevada. This site was originally developed by First Solar and sold to Sempra, which has signed a PPA with PG&E for the electricity generated at Copper Mountain 2. Our goal is to continue to replace current year construction with new PPA or EPC agreements to continue to grow our pipeline.
The orange line shows our increasing project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008, to the planned 450 megawatts in 2011, and we expect to build 1 gigawatt in 2012. The slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of our Utility Systems customer base, including IPPs, utilities, and financial investors. In the back of this presentation, Slide 23, shows the details of the North American contracted projects we are executing and have under development.
On Page 14, you can see some of the project activity in the second quarter. We now have completed a significant portion of the mounting instructions on Agua Caliente and have begun module installation. The Amherstburg 2 and Santa Teresa projects are nearly completed, and Paloma and PNM projects are ahead of schedule.
To summarize, we continued to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market and remained focused on achieving our mission. Our visibility is improving for the second half of the year, an increasing portion of our revenues and profits are under our control as we construct our systems pipeline and continue to diversify geographically. Our LCOE is approaching grid parity which should drive elasticity and demand and a growth of sustainable markets. We are investing for growth in the United States, India, the Middle East, Australia and China. We are executing a systems pipeline and we're adding to it. We continue to expand our factories and drive our products roadmaps. We achieved a major BoS in module efficiency milestone as a result of our investment in R&D and our continuous improvement processes, and we have the financial strength to continue investing in the long-term future of our business.
Finally, our 2011 guidance is solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"
4593731,138429703,152903,"First Solar, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 17, our net sales for the second quarter were $533 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs which were down 13% quarter-over-quarter as we reduce prices to",1285,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 17, our net sales for the second quarter were $533 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs which were down 13% quarter-over-quarter as we reduce prices to sell-through such is our geographic mix. As Rob said earlier, the quarter started slowly due to the European policy uncertainties which adversely impacted demand for the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effects of increased systems revenue recognition driven by Santa Teresa, Paloma and PNM. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 8% of total net sales from the first quarter to 11% of net sales in the second quarter. We also increased the module allocation for the systems business during the quarter and to make contract auxiliary schedules which will result in revenue recognition of the second half of the year.
The early increase from Q2 to Q1, however, the stronger euro had a minor negative impact on net sales as we were significant hedged in line with our long-term strategy. Gross margin was 36.6%, down 9.2 percentage points from the prior quarter. The decline was the result of the ASPs decreases, a mix shift both geographically and to more system sales and an unfavorable FX impact. Module gross margin was 40.2%, down 9.5 percentage points from the prior quarter. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter. Slightly higher R&D expenses associated with efficiency improvements were offset by lower production start up costs as Frankfurt-Oder and Malaysia ramped. SG&A was flat quarter-over-quarter. We focused on managing our expense growth to help partially offset lower gross margin.
Operating income was $65 million compared to $129 million in the first quarter. The decline was due to the decrease in total net sales and gross margins. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.1% compared to 22.8% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of the systems revenue recognition. Second quarter net income was $61 million or $0.70 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate grows 2.2 percentage points to 15% due to the mixed shift of profits to higher tax jurisdictions which lowered EPS by $0.02 in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were down quarter-over-quarter with $515 million. Accounts receivable trade balance rose quarter-over-quarter due to the nominal shipments as policy changes in Europe pushed our customers orders to the back half of the quarter. Accounts receivable non-build increased because of growth in North America business and the timing of project billing cycle as specified in customer contracts. Inventories increased as we increase production from a KLM 6 and FFO2 and due to more module and balance systems materials in transit for EPC installations in the third quarter. Project assets rose as we continue to develop North America project sites. We continue to invest to increase our factory capacity and we have the long-term bits to help finance Malaysia and German expansions.
Operating cash flow was negative $203 million and free cash flow was negative $408 million. We spent $221 million for capital expenditures and depreciation was $54 million. Cash flow was impacted by accounts receivable linearity, growth in project assets and inventory and deferred revenue growth on more construction in progress in our systems business. Also, we invested about $52 million more on capital expenditures when compared to the first quarter of 2011.
As expected, we consumed cash in the first half of the year and planned to generate cash in the second half of 2011 as we complete the sales projects in our systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10%. This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. Our stock exchange rate assumption is $1.40 per euro. For the third quarter, about 69% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged in an average rate of $1.34 per euro. For the balance of the year, about 72% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged in an average rate of $1.35 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the euro-dollar slot exchange rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and will not change our net income guidance since we are fully hedged for 2011. Our Module pricing reflects European FiT changes in 2011 it is embedded to enable sell-through economics and is based on our estimate of the current competitive market.
We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of system projects in North America. We have the flexibility to increase this amount to 500 megawatts should the demand in other markets fall short of our current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We plan to minimize our expense growth in the second half of 2011. Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 are fully ramped and we are ramping FFO2 in Q3. Our capital expenditures is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam and the U.S..
Page 20 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. The new factory ramp 
penalty and profitable sale will range from $8 million to $10 million. And the factory start-up expenses will range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be $115 million to $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to the cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $960 million which is slightly below our prior guidance at the high end of the range. Our revised effective tax rate will be 13% to 15% as more profit is recognized in higher tax locations. The 2% increase from prior guidance reduces EPS by about $0.20. Year-end 2011 fully diluted share count is expected to be 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to range from $9 to $9.50, $0.25 lower than prior guidance as we reflect a higher tax rate and a more aggressive pricing environment. We offset a portion of this by holding expenses flat. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $800 million to $900 million. Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $500 million to $600 million. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 5%.
Finally, Slide 21 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue and operating income dollars throughout 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 on each chart, the sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that at third quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 28% of our full year revenue and approximately 30% of our operating income guidance. The profile was driven by the following assumption: first, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter; second, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter; third, we have significant operating expense leverage in the second half. We are slow in the growth rate in expenses but we'll continue to focus on R&D and market development. Additionally, start-up expenses declined to about $8 million per quarter for Mesa and Vietnam. Finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator?"

SBC, testing ramp, insurance and other production costs and things like that. So ballpark on a comparative basis if you look at our cost per watt on the same basis it's about $0.68 in that range would be the equivalent comparison. And one of the things that I don't know maybe didn't come out during the presentation as well is, that we, this year, have changed somewhat how we implement some of the changes with the manufacturing team and we made the decision based on megawatts produced on a full year basis on line to take lines down for more extended periods. So say a week at a time whereas before would've done it a piece mail more to keep the lines up and running. And the reason we did that was twofold. So one is, the market conditions and the challenges in volume created an opportunity for it. And two, we feel like for the total year, off of the same lines, we'll able to produce more megawatts. So it's kind of back to where we were I think last year, about this time where we talked about with all these lines we have and the Copy Smart approach, how do we change and make the changes appropriately and continue to bring the cost down? So we have a more of a stair-step type of approach versus the incremental change quarter-over-quarter and that's really what we've been working on a part of what you're seeing. So it's still down year-over-year, but it's something that it takes more significant effort with all the lines that we have and some of the changes that we're making. So you'll see the benefits of the change and effort we've made in Q4 of this year, both in the inefficiencies and line run rate. So a little bit lumpier than our past."

So that's, right now, what we are sorting through, but we see it as positive and I think that you should start to see more volume in China and especially that I mentioned -- I've heard the mentioned of increasing the targets for 2015 and you heard the mention of the range from 20 to 50 gigawatts by 2020. So they're obviously huge goals in the process and we've been waiting for the clarity on something that make sense from a sustainable standpoint. And this tariff seems to and now you've got to get through the process of an approval to make sure that your project gets in the pipeline. So that's what we are working on."

And then there is the productivity element, the speed with which we get the generation and that's a big part of the economics and the equation. So that's really the 3 ways. And I think last quarter, we talked a little bit about some inflation pressures which all I get to do is look at the commodities out there whether it's your copper and all of the things, we get pressure there, but we work through it from the other 2 means, so design and productivity in terms of how we get things installed.

So what happened in Q2 and really in the first half is, that a lot of excess inventory in the system with the demand kind of stalling because of all the things we talked about earlier in the presentation. And when that happens, it puts a lot of pressure on the price side and we work for rebate system with our customers to fund them and support them so the price pressure in the external market is high from a third-party sales standpoint and that's part of what impacted our Q2 results. So we're continuing to manage and monitor that. We still feel confident in the concept and our approach to being able to buffer some of those fluctuations with our captive pipeline. And as we get near and nearer to having those things finalized and funded, especially here in the second half, as you said, Agua will start to recognize revenue on in Q3.

As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but our business model and our execution served us well, and we're positioned for a significant and b",2587,"Great. Thanks, Larry. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. As all of you know, it was a challenging quarter for the solar PV industry, including First Solar, but our business model and our execution served us well, and we're positioned for a significant and better second half.
Starting with Slide 6. Q2 net sales of $533 million, that's about 6% lower than last quarter, primarily due to lower average selling prices. Solar PV' policy uncertainties in Italy, Germany and France adversely impacted demand in the second quarter. Net sales were also impacted as we allocated modules to the Systems business which we did not recognize as revenue within the quarter.
Second quarter net income was $61 million or 11.5% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.70. Return on net assets was 13.1% on a 4-quarter rolling basis representing an EVA [ph] of about 1.1%. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $515 million declined $198 million sequentially as we invested CapEx for new factories and continued construction in several systems projects.
In addition, shipments were weighted to the end of the quarter as customers delayed orders until  European policy changes were better understood.
Despite the challenging European market in the first half of the year, our 2011 outlook remains solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. We expect significantly better performance in the remainder of 2011 as we build projects from our systems pipeline, develop promising new markets and execute our cost and efficiency roadmaps. As a result, our updated 2011 EPS guidance is $9 to $9.50 per fully diluted share, which includes 450 megawatts at system sales, and some updated assumptions which Mark will discuss later. Significant drivers in the change is a 2% increase in the effective tax rate or about $0.20 per share reduction, driven by the increased portion of profits in the U.S.
Moving on now to operations. Q2 production was 483 megawatts, up 40% versus the prior year and up 19% quarter-over-quarter. This sequential increase was driven by the production ramp of the KLM 6 factory and early startup of Frankfurt-Oder 2. Module revenue shipments were up 6% quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in average selling prices. A portion of this incremental production also went to systems project construction for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.5 percentage points year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Module manufacturing and cost per watt was $0.75, which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of our modules from low-cost manufacturing sites was offset by FX, lower line throughput, higher spending and factory ramp costs. Core costs, which excluded the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, was $0.73 per watt. And we're very pleased to announce that our Malaysian plants have achieved a new core cost milestone of $0.69 per watt.
Annual capacity per line decreased by 2 megawatts quarter-over-quarter to 62.1-megawatt per line. Line throughput and cost per watt were both impacted this quarter as we decided to take advantage of softer industry demand to schedule downtime and begin to implement conversion efficiency improvements which we expect will have a meaningful impact by the end of the year.
We also reached a milestone with our standard utility-scale Balance of Systems by achieving a cost level of $0.99 per watt. BoS is down 29% from the second quarter of 2009. We are now also close to our 2014 target for standard BoS of $0.91 to $0.98 per watt and can improve further as our planned module efficiencies increase to 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. This major accomplishment is the result of our experience in team teaching [ph], investment in engineering and R&D, and cycles of learning from almost 400 megawatts of DC of projects built to date.
To summarize our manufacturing capacity addition. Malaysia 5 and 6 are at full production. Frankfurt-Oder 2 began ramping a month early and is expected to be at full production by the end of the third quarter. Construction of our Mesa, Arizona, and Vietnam sites are progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012.
Moving now to Page 7. Despite the recent market turbulence, our growth strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on our mission of making solar affordable and sustainable to gain access to the multi-terawatt peak electricity generation market. We are currently in a transition phase as FiTs and other government policies are progressing towards parity and market diversification continues. First Solar has made significant progress reducing a levelized cost of electricity, diversifying geographically, and we expect price declines to continue to drive demand elasticity.
On the next page, you can see we've made significant progress in lowering our total systems costs by 30% in 3 years. If we can reduce that by another 19%, we believe that we can provide turnkey utility-scale systems that generate power at an LCOE of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour in high-radiant zones like the U.S. Southwest, India, China, Australia, the Middle East, Spain and Italy. This is what will drive our participation in the peak electricity generation market.
Now turning to Page 9. Our module manufacturing cost, as you know, has steadily declined since 2008.  And future improvements to our year-end 2014 target are primarily driven by conversion efficiency growth, 13.5% to 14.5% efficiency and annual line throughput improvements to 80 megawatt per line. We are committed to our long-term module conversion efficiency roadmap, and we invest heavily in technology to achieve this end. Our investments in technology are not focused on hero cells. We emphasize practical improvements with a low-cost pathway to implementation and production. However, it is nice to see that when we integrate several of these improvements, we are able to deliver a device that does exceed the prior world record. We recently received confirmation from NREL that First Solar's cells achieved a record 17.3% efficiency for CdTe thin-film, which breaks the previous record of 16.7% which was set in 2001.
Unlike other cell records, this cell was constructed using only full-scale manufacturing processes and commercial materials. Therefore, we believe they can be reproduced economically. This is an important milestone because it validates our technology capabilities and significantly improves CdTe thin-film efficiencies and it provides confidence in the improvements we have planned over the next few years. Our achievement is a direct result of our industry-leading annual investment in research and development and the efforts of the committed team that you see here. We are considering approaches to accelerate module efficiency quicker than our current roadmap of the 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014 to support rooftop and other high-efficiency applications.
The next page shows how we have been steadily diversifying geographically and investing in market development. Our North American business has grown from 17% to 25% of megawatt shift and is expected to be our #1 market in 2012. In India, supportive policies and new local partners are driving strong growth, and we expect India to account for more than 10% of our megawatts this year. Our North American pipeline and new markets like India are helping to offset European market uncertainties, and both are expected to be multi-gigawatt, sustainable markets. In the second quarter, North America and India combined represented almost 50% of our revenues.
Moving to Page 11. In market development we're focused on executing our North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. In North America, we made progress executing on the 450-megawatt DC of planned 2011 systems build and have flexibility to build up to 500 megawatts. Agua Caliente now has a significant portion of the BoS completed and we have begun installing modules. The sale of Agua Caliente to NRG and the closing of the debt financing including the DOE loan guarantee are expected soon. All major steps have been completed, and we are in the funding stage. We will begin to recognize the revenue for the construction of this 290-megawatt AC system in Q3. When completed, it will be more than 3x larger than any PV power plant currently operating.
We are focused on adding to our systems pipeline on a global basis through new RFPs, EPC agreements and acquisitions. For example, we recently added 150-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with Sempra Generation for Copper Mountain 2 in Boulder City, Nevada. This grows our systems pipelines to about 2.6 gigawatts. Sunlight, Topaz and AVSR1 achieved $4.5 billion of DOE loans and conditional commitments in Q2. Topaz received its conditional use permit and is in the legal appeal period. AVSR is expected to begin construction in the third quarter. In Europe, we are managing through market uncertainty due to feed-in tariff and policy changes. The delayed implementation of a new decree in Italy, the slow start to Germany after January's FiT reductions and lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process contributed to excess channel inventories for the industry.
During the second quarter, we worked with customers to enable discrete project realization, and we increased rebates to enable distributors to sell through. In France, First Solar and our partners are realizing 250 megawatts of projects in 2011. Now we have a clearer picture in Italy, Germany, France and the U.K., but the new policies have created a more challenging operating environment.
We are making progress in developing new markets. Our 2011 planned shipments in India have now grown to more than 200 megawatts, which is up from 100 megawatts in Q1 and 10 megawatts sold in 2010. We recently signed 4 new module customers in India and have contracted more than 250 megawatts year-to-date for deliveries in 2011 and into 2012. We are seeing an increasing number of tenders as well in the Middle East for 2012 and beyond.
On Page 12 is the latest analyst consensus forecast of global PV market demand. On average, the 15 analysts included in this survey estimate that the 2011 market will grow to 19.8 gigawatts, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America, Italy, India and China. The analysts' estimates -- estimate a compound growth rate of 12% from 2010  to 2013 as the markets diversify to North America, India, China, Japan, the Middle East and the rest of the world beyond Europe. Government policies, lower pricing, solar [ph] resource and economics are driving market diversification and demand elasticity. These markets are transitioning to sustainable markets as we anticipated in our growth strategy.
In general, we believe demand in the major solar markets will improve in the second half of 2011 after a difficult first half. We see significant growth opportunities long term as new markets are emerging and we advance towards group parity. The German market is recovering from a slow start and appears to be ramping towards around 4 to 5 gigawatt in 2011. The recent EEG decision provides good long-term visibility, and we are well-positioned as at the German manufacturer.
In Italy, the market is adjusting to the new CE4 [ph] published in May and is recovering from a policy interruption in the first half. Demand is improving and is expected to be 2 to 3 gigawatts in 2011. Stable and reliable regular utility frameworks will be the key elements for long-term sustainable development of the Italian market. First Solar technology and Europe manufacturing expansion will help to position us for success in the Italian market.
France's policy does not provide sufficient long-term visibility at the moment, while we continue to be optimistic about the longer-term opportunity. In the short-term, due to building grandfathered projects, the French market should range from 500 to 800 megawatts. Our 2-line facility planned for Blanquefort remains on indefinite hold.
The North American market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California, over 1 gigawatt of RFOs were issued for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. Over time, the requirement for government subsidies may decline as ROEs or early adopters do the same.
In China, the government is in the process of developing a longer-term plan for the market, with the potential to increase their 2020 goal from 20 to 50 gigawatts. China recently announced the new national FiT with the potential to provide sustainable economics at 1.15 RMB per kilowatt hour. We continue to see strong momentum in India.  The market is expected to grow to about 500 megawatts in 2011.
In Australia, we were unfortunately not selected for the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program but remain well-positioned for the second phase. Solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced national carbon legislation, which has committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind large-scale renewables and to the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility-scale projects.
In Southeast Asia, we see encouraging signs of early-stage development in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we see great potential in the Middle East. There are challenges facing oil-exporting countries with  rapid growth in domestic energy needs, tongue [ph] tenders for utility-scale projects are underway and we expect to see more robust renewable policies that could drive a several-hundred-megawatt market in just a few years.
On the next page, you can see how we've grown our systems pipeline over time. We signed a 150-megawatt AC EPC agreement with Sempra Generation for the expansion of Copper Mountain in Boulder City, Nevada. This site was originally developed by First Solar and sold to Sempra, which has signed a PPA with PG&E for the electricity generated at Copper Mountain 2. Our goal is to continue to replace current year construction with new PPA or EPC agreements to continue to grow our pipeline.
The orange line shows our increase in project construction from 12 megawatts in 2008 to the planned 450 megawatts in 2011, and we expect to build 1 gigawatt in 2012. The slide also illustrates the expansion and diversification of our utility systems customer base, including IPPs, utilities, and financial investors. In the back of this presentation, Slide 23 shows the details of the North American contracted project we are executing and have under development.
On Page 14, you can see some of the project activity in the second quarter. We now have completed a significant portion of the mounting structures on Agua Caliente and have begun module installation. The Amherstburg 2 and Santa Teresa projects are nearly completed, and Paloma and PNM projects are ahead of schedule.
To summarize, we continued to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market and remained focused on achieving our mission. Our visibility is improving for the second half of the year. An increasing portion of our revenues and profits are under our control as we construct our systems pipeline and continue to diversify geographically. Our LCOE is approaching grid parity, which should drive elasticity and demand and a growth of sustainable markets. We are investing for growth in the United States, India, the Middle East, Australia and China. We are executing a systems pipeline and we're adding to it. We continue to expand our factories and drive our products' roadmaps. We achieved a major BoS in module efficiency milestones as a result of our investment in R&D and our continuous improvement processes, and we have the financial strength to continue investing in the long-term future of our business.
Finally, our 2011 guidance is solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Net sales for the second quarter were $533 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs, which were down 13% quarter-over-quarter as the reduced prices to sell-through shifted our geographic mix. As Rob said earlier, the quarter started slowly due to the European policy uncertainties, which adversely impacted demand for the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effects of increased systems revenue recognition driven by Santa Teresa, Paloma and PNM. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 8% of total net sales in the first quarter to 11% of net sales in the second quarter. We also increased the module allocation for the System business during the quarter to meet contract auxiliary schedules, which will result in revenue recognition in the second half of the year.
The euro increased from Q1. However, the stronger euro had a minor negative impact on net sales as we were significantly hedged, in line with our long-term strategy. Gross margin was 36.6%, down 9.2 percentage points from the prior quarter. The decline was the result of the ASP's decreases, a mix shift both geographically and to more system sales and an unfavorable FX impact. Module gross margin was 40.2%, down 9.5 percentage points from the prior quarter. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter. Slightly higher R&D expenses associated with efficiency improvements were offset by lower production startup costs as Frankfurt-Oder and Malaysia ramped. SG&A was flat quarter-over-quarter. We focused on managing our expense growth to help partially offset lower gross margins.
Operating income was $65 million compared to $129 million in the first quarter. The decline was due to the decrease in total net sales and gross margins. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.1% compared to 22.8% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of the systems revenue recognition. Second quarter net income was $61 million or $0.70 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate rose 2.2 percentage points to 15% due to the mix shift of profits in the higher tax jurisdictions, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were down quarter-over-quarter to $515 million. Accounts receivable trade balance rose quarter-over-quarter due to the non-linear shipments as policy changes in Europe pushed our customers' orders to the back half of the quarter. Accounts receivable non-billed increased because of growth in North America business and the timing of project billing cycles as specified in customer contracts. Inventories increased as we increased production from a KLM 6 and FFO2 and due to more module and balance systems materials in transit for EPC installations in the third quarter. Project assets rose as we continued to develop North America project sites. We continue to invest to increase our factory capacity, and we have the long-term bids [ph]  To help finance Malaysia and Germany expansions.
Operating cash flow was negative $203 million, and free cash flow was negative $408 million. We spent $221 million for capital expenditures, and depreciation was $54 million. Cash flow was impacted by accounts receivable linearity, growth in project assets and inventory and deferred revenue growth on more construction in progress in our systems business. Also, we invested about $52 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2011.
As expected, we consumed cash in the first half of the year and plan to generate cash in the second half of 2011 as we complete the sales projects in our Systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. Our spot exchange rate assumption is $1.40 per euro. For the third quarter, about 69% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. For the balance of the year, about 72% of our net sales and all of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.35 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the euro-dollar spot exchange rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and will not change our net income guidance since we are fully hedged for 2011. Our module pricing reflects European FiT changes in 2011.  It is intended to enable sell-through economics and is based on our estimate of the current competitive market.
We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of system projects in North America. We have the flexibility to increase this amount to 500 megawatt should the demand in other markets fall short of our current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We plan to minimize our expense growth in the second half of 2011. Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 are fully ramped, and we are ramping FFO2 in Q3. Our capital expenditures is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam and the U.S.
Page 20 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. The new factory ramp 
penalty and cost of goods sold will range from $8 million to $10 million. And the factory startup expenses will range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be $115 million to $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to the cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $960 million, which is slightly below our prior guidance at the high end of the range. Our revised effective tax rate will be 13% to 15% as more profit is recognized in higher tax locations. The 2% increase from prior guidance reduces EPS by about $0.20. Year-end 2011 fully diluted share count is expected to be 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to range from $9 to $9.50, $0.25 lower than prior guidance as we reflect a higher tax rate and a more aggressive pricing environment. We offset a portion of this by holding expenses flat. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $800 million to $900 million. Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $500 million to $600 million. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by 5%.
Finally, Slide 21 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue and operating income dollars throughout 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 on each chart, the sum of all quarters is 100%. Note that  third quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 28% of our full year revenue and approximately 30% of our operating income guidance. The profile was driven by the following assumptions: first, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter; second, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter; third, we have significant operating expense leverage in the second half. We are slowing the growth rate in expenses but will continue to focus on R&D and market development. Additionally, startup expenses declined to about $8 million per quarter for Mesa and Vietnam. Finally, we will continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator?"

Well, yes, we -- usually we don't talk about it, but from what I know in our analysis, what the competitors do is they exclude things like shipping, warranty, recycling, obviously, SBC, capacity ramp, insurance and other production costs and things like that. So ballpark on a comparative basis if you looked at our cost per watt on the same basis, about $0.68 in that range would be the equivalent comparison. And one of the things that, I don't know, maybe didn't come out during the presentation as well is that we, this year, have changed somewhat how we implement some of the changes with the manufacturing team. And we made the decision based on megawatts produced on a full year basis on line to take lines down for more an extended period. So say a week at a time whereas before we would've done it piecemeal more to keep the lines up and running. And the reason we did that was twofold. So one is the market conditions and challenges in volume created an opportunity for it. And two, we feel like for the total year, off of the same lines, we'll able to produce more megawatts. So it's kind of back to where we were I think last year, about this time where we talked about with all these lines we have and the Copy Smart approach, how do we change and make the changes appropriately and continue to bring the cost down? So it will come in more of a stair-step type of approach versus the incremental change quarter-over-quarter, and that's really what we've been working on and part of what you've seen. So it's still down year-over-year, but it's something that takes more significant effort with all the lines that we have and some of the changes that we're making. So you'll see the benefits of the change and effort we've made in Q4 of this year, both in efficiencies and line run rate. So it'll be a little bit lumpier than our past."

And that's a big part of the economics and the equation. So that's really the 3 ways. And I think last quarter, we talked a little bit about some inflation pressures, which all you got to do is look at some of the commodities out there, whether it's your [ph] copper or other things, or all this [ph].  We get pressure there, but we work through it from the other 2 means, so design and productivity in terms of how we get things installed.

We don't talk specifically about ASP because we try to manage our customers and position in the market by providing and driving sell-through. So we want our customers to develop captive projects in the pipeline, so they need to have some visibility out about a year or so to do that. So what happened in Q2 and really in the first half is that a lot of excess inventory in the system with the demand kind of stalling because of all the things we talked about earlier in the presentation. And when that happens, it puts a lot of pressure on the price side.  And we work through a rebate system with our customers to fund them and support them so the price pressure in the external market is high from a third-party sales standpoint and that's part of what impacted our Q2 results. So we're continuing to manage and monitor that. We still feel confident in the concept and our approach to being able to buffer some of those fluctuations with our captive pipeline. And as we get nearer and nearer to having those things finalized and funded, especially here in the second half, as we said, Agua will start to recognize revenue on in Q3. That will become something that is very viable for us to do, is to balance those 2 things together.

I'd like to start by briefly addressing the CEO transition we announced last week. The board felt a leadership change was necessary in order for the company to navigate through the current market conditions and achieve its full potential. When hiring decisions do not work out, it's usually the result of a FiT between the employee and the position not being right as opposed to some particular shortcoming in the employee. And in this case, it was the FiT that wasn't right, that's ultimately determined by the Board and as the person who strongly influenced the hiring decision, I take responsibility for the choice we make. I know there's been a lot of speculation about whether it was some type of fraud or legal action, under government investigation or a major operational problem behind the move, and I can tell you none of these things were part of the board deliberations. This was simply a question of FiT. 
Now I'd like to move on and talk about the business. The team and I are working to our annual planning process now. In early December, we plan to discuss our 2012 annual operating plan and our updated strategy, more specifics at that time but in the meantime, let me provide you with an overview of how we're generally viewing the business. 
When we started First Solar in 1999, our mission was to make solar electricity a meaningful part of the electricity supply worldwide and to lead a whole new industry that would be self-sustaining both economically and environmentally. To accomplish that, we felt we must as a midterm goal the supply plan for success and we defined that platform that included first, the ability to profitably deliver solar electricity at a price as low as $100 a megawatt hour, which we believe would make solar economical almost everywhere in the world. Second, a global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale in order to deliver meaningful quantities of solar to mass markets. And third, a close engagement with policymakers, regulators and customers worldwide to identify needs we could solve with solar power and drive a robust flow of innovative solutions to meet their needs. Today, much of this platform has been built, we have reduced Module manufacturing cost per watt from $1.59 in 2005 which is our first full year of production, to $0.74 this past quarter. We are executing a plan to further reduce cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 a watt and increase conversion efficiencies from 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. We've also built a superior EPC capability where innovative designs and practices combined with scale has enabled us to reduce standard Balance of System cost from $1.56 per watt in 2008 to below $1 per watt today. And it's provided us with unique insights into the optimization of large power plant performance and reliability. Over the past year alone, we've reduced our time to build and represented 50 megawatts solar generation plant from 10 months to 7 months, and we're continuing to execute plans to reduce Balance of System cost and cycle times to define targets through 2014. Now these cost reduction and conversion efficiency improvement plans are not without risk, but the plans are reasonable and the targets are feasible. And achieving these goals would enable us to price solar electricity for as low as $100 to $120 a megawatt hour which makes solar electricity affordable in many parts of the world. We are also well on our way to building the second plank of the platform in global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale. Our module production capacity in North America, Europe and Asia enables us to produce and install multi-gigawatt of solar every year. We are continuing to localize our supply chain and to expand it beyond modules to balance the system components in order to continuously improve economics, speed and flexibility. And finally, we've innovated beyond the solar Module to develop a diverse first toolbox of solutions for our customers, including engineered systems, constructed systems, O&M services, project financing and end-of-life recycling. And we are developing additional solutions that will enable us to meet customer needs and open new markets. Underlying these accomplishments are a superior process technology and a strong culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement which will allow us to continue the strong trajectory of innovation improvement that have been demonstrated in the past. 
In summary, the platform we set up to build when we started First Solar in 1999 largely exists today, so we're uniquely positioned to move into that space in mid-subsidy markets where we've operated in the past to becoming a part of the mainstream electricity markets worldwide, which has always been our goal and the reason we formed this company. As we look to the future, we see significant opportunities to meet global energy needs with solar power. In the U.S. alone, the 300 gigawatt plus coal generation fleet is aging, over 2/3 of that fleet is more than 30 years old and much of it lacks meaningful environmental controls. We do not believe this generation will be replaced by new coal generation nor do we think most utilities, regulators or project financiers believe this will occur. Instead, the U.S. electricity generation mix will likely shift toward lower carbon solutions which will include some combinations of natural gas, renewable energy, and possibly, nuclear power in some communities. The opportunities to integrate affordable, reliable solar power solutions into this new energy infrastructure will be significant. In Europe, the mandate in Germany to shut our nuclear plants by 2022 and the EU objective of 20% renewables by 2020 will continue to drive demand for renewable energy including solar power. And we believe these programs will expand well beyond 2020. 
We also believe solar power has an integral role to play in addressing India's massive energy needs. Peak electricity generation capacity in India currently lag demand and demand continues to grow robustly. Roughly 35% to 40% of the population in India lacks access to electricity and much of the electrified population depends on expensive diesel generation. India's high can be harnessed to help meet a significant part of these energy needs. We believe China will satisfy a meaningful amount of its massive future electricity demand for renewable energy sources, trading large demand for solar power. 
And as we look out into the future, we also see a number of other geographic markets where solar power can play an important role including developing countries where roughly 2 billion people currently operate without access to electricity. So in summary, our operating platform and the tremendous global need for solar power give us confidence that our mission to create enduring value by enabling the world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity is not only vital but more obtainable today than it has ever been. 
So in spite of these future prospects, the fact is that today, we operate a subsidized markets with a short-term prospects are not as attractive. The European countries that subsidize demand to enable the solar industry to scale into its present level have been reducing their subsidies. In the U.S., there have been no significant new state-level solar programs in several years. But with solar industries feeding off of legacy subsidies in California. At the same time, supply chain entry barriers for silicon have evaporated, leading to massive capacity buildup. Excess supply relative to demand has led to pricing and margin reduction because demand in the short-term is inelastic, and by that, I mean any lower prices might enable the company to take more share with the declining subsidy pool, but they will increase aggregate demand. Because of that, returns on capital have also declined. 
So for First Solar the central catch is to transition from these less attractive markets towards the market that will drive the future and to do so in a manner that will offer operational and financial stability. 
Now specifically, we must do the following things. First, go where we can solve pressing problems, that means places like India, Middle East, North Africa and China, it also means building teams on the ground and engaging deeply with local customers and communities to identify and address their needs. Second, develop innovative solutions anchored by our module, but extended beyond that to new technologies, system applications and offerings that are needed to solve real customer needs in ways that are both unique and compelling. Third, formed deep working relationships with the policymakers and regulators in these key geographic markets in order to develop market frameworks that will enable large-scale solar deployment. And fourth, price to levels required to drive demand without the need for significant solar subsidies. It's easy to talk about these things, executing them with the sense of urgency will be more difficult. These actions will cost money, they will take time and they will not yield massive results overnight. But this is the time for First Solar to move to the future and we are uniquely positioned to do this now. We have an extremely capable executive team, talented and committed associates and a highly supportive board and we're ready to move. As I think about why have we made more progress to date and expanding the beyond traditional subsidized markets, I believe there are 3 things principally that have been holding us back. The first is inertia. The normal operating rhythm and comfort level of the organization has caused that to continue to allocate most of our resources to the legacy markets that by declining subsidy pool. So now we need to make hard shifts to the future and develop new markets. The second is short-term fixation with earnings per share. Operating to maximize GAAP EPS in the short term despite declining subsidy pulls and massive oversupply is not a good strategy when it leads to suboptimizing investment in the future. Our decision-making is to be guided the creation of long-term fundamental economic value rather than short-term financial metrics that depend on shrinking subsidy programs. The third is confusing factory expansion with growth. When we grow by identifying customers with pressing needs and serving them in ways that are compelling and unique. Building more factories absent this type of demand creation does not lead to growth. It presents us from focusing on the right things to do. Our emphasis needs right now to be on creating new markets. So we'll provide more detail in December as we complete our 2012 strategic and operating plan, but directionally, you can expect these things. And emphasis on identifying and serving new customers a new geographic markets; deeper global engagement with policy makers, regulators and utilities to develop market frameworks that enable large-scale solar power; resource allocation that enables us to fund important growth programs while maintaining financial soundness despite declining price levels; and finally, a slowdown in new factory expansion until new sustainable market demand develops. And in that regard, we decided to postpone commissioning of Vietnam and we continued to study the rest of our capacity planning to ensure that it is in line with our demand. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to review our operational and financial results, and then update guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets has continued to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe",2917,"Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. 
Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets has continued to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe remains aggressive as modest supply feeds demand. During the third quarter, we worked with our customers to enable them to realize this great projects and adjusted our pricing to best position distributors to sell through in a challenging demand environment. 
In Q4, we are revising our framework contract pricing approach to eliminate the complexities of rebates and help enhance our customers liquidity. Specific countries and geographies, first, Germany. The German market has seen a slowdown in demand, well into the third quarter and appears to be trending towards around 4 to 5 gigawatts in 2011. The reason e decisions provides good long-term visibility and we are well-positioned as the German manufacturer. In Italy, the market is adjusting to renew see for published in May and recovering from a policy interruption in the first half. Demand has been improving as an expected to be about 4 to 5 gigawatts by the end of the year. Second half demand impacted by monthly feed-in tariffs and the upcoming restrictions on land-use. In addition, we are seeing project financing constraining the sales channel. France has published details on tender mechanisms for large systems and the future incentive schemes for small installations which provides sufficient long-term opportunity. In the short term, due to building grandfather projects, the French market should range from 1 to 1.4 gigawatts in 2011. 
As a reminder, as previously announced, our two-line factory facility planned in France remains an investment hold. It's Spain, the regulatory environment is very stable and provides good visibility. We expect that market will remain at about 500 megawatts in 2011. The North America market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California over 1 gigawatts of RFOs were issued in it for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. And our vertical integrated model continues to position us well in North America. In China, growth in the market is driven by the national feed-in tariff of 1.15 renminbi per kilowatt for projects completed before the end of the year and 1 RMD per kilowatt hour for projects completed after. We are focused on executing demonstration projects and building our diverse commercial relationships with the leading generation companies. In Australia, solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced National Carbon legislation, which is committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind large-scale renewables and the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility scale projects. We signed an agreement with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial services to provide First Solar EPC capabilities to build Australia's first utility scale project PV. 
Mike highlighted optimism on the market in India. The optimism is supported by our recently announced 100-megawatt Module supply of industry alliance, one of India's leading independent producers. In southeast Asia, we're seeing encouraging signs of early-stage developments in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we have seen great potential in the Middle East. We have submitted some bits for early tenders for utility scale projects and we expect to see more robust renewable policies that can drive a sizable market in a few years. 
Now moving on to operations on Slide 7. In Q3, our production was 551 megawatts, up 58% versus the prior year, and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by a fold of the from our new KLM 6 in Frankfurt-Oder 2 factories. A portion of this incremental production went to systems project construction but which revenue had not yet been recognized. Annual capacity per line increased by 1 megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 63.1 megawatt. Our throughput increased as downtime was less than last quarter and we've begun to benefit from planned efficiency increases. Our average Module efficiency was 11.8%, which is up 0.5 percentage point year-over-year and 10th of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter. Our best lines were operating net in that 12.4% efficiency in Q3, which is up 4 tenths of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter. So far, for the fourth quarter, our platform is averaging 12%, which is 2 tenths of a percentage point greater the last quarter. This gives us strong confidence we can continue increase our efficiency over the short and long-term. We also recently introduced 87 lot Module into the market. Module manufacturing costs per watt was $0.74, which is down $0.01 quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher conversion efficiency. Cost which excludes the ramp penalty and stock -based compensation was $0.73 per watt. We expect to drive our Module costs down to the mid- '60s by the end of 2012 as accelerate our efficiency roadmap by 8 technology from the record 17.3% highlighted in our Q2 earnings call. 
Now moving to Slide 8. As we improve our operational capabilities we have also strengthened our Systems business. Year-to-date, we have added 654-megawatt ACE of contracts our pipeline, including 222 megawatts AC in the third quarter. Recent additions were 130-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with NASCO, a 66-megawatt EPC agreement with Energy and a 16-megawatt agreement with Constellation Energy, and 10-megawatt for Our first utility scale project in Australia with verve energy and GE Energy Financial Services. As our pipeline additions exceeded our megawatts installed, we have grown our pipeline to 2.7 gigawatts. In addition to adding our pipeline, we are making progress in moving forward with existing projects on our pipeline. At Wachovia and say, we closed the sale of 2 energy and the legal guarantee. We have now completed over 35% of the BeOS installed over 1.4 million modules in Agua Caliente. We see the daily loan guarantee and we sold to repeat customers GE and NextEra. AVSR1 also read receive a daily loan guarantee and was holding to a new customer, Exelon energy. As you know we ran out of time on Topaz to complete the daily negotiations but what we're investing which uses with the buyer and expect to include the sale over the next few months. This past few we are doing well in improving metrics we can control, increasing efficiency, reducing costs, increasing throughput and growing our systems pipeline. However, these products the fully offset a sluggish demand and aggressive pricing environment. Therefore, we have decided to slowdown factory expansions, which we'll discuss on Slide 9. 
Looking at Slide 9. You have seen this slide versions of this slide in the past. There are 2 differences between the slide and the 1 presented last you. One, the new slide no longer includes Vietnam as we have posted commission being until new sustainable market development market demand develops. Two, we have increased throughput estimates for 2012 in response to Module efficiency increases and other manufacturing improvements. We anticipate achieving capacity per line as of 70 megawatts by the end of 2012. Regarding Mesa, we currently are on schedule for initial shipments in the third quarter of 2012. 
As you would anticipate, we will continue to study our 2011 demand need to ensure an alliance -- 2012 alliance capacity needs to ensure that it alliance with our demand. 
Moving on from financial portion of the presentation on Slide 10. Net sales for the second quarter were just over $1 billion, operating $533 million from last quarter. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of North American systems business which was highlighted by significant construction projects at Agua Caliente. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 11% of total net sales in the second quarter so 39% of net sales in the third quarter. Our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems business increased from 20% in the second quarter to 65% in the third quarter. Overall, ASP's increased 17% quarter-over-quarter due to a mix shift to more modules for systems which were more offset by an ASP decline of 8% quarter-over-quarter for third-party modules sales. Gross margin was 37.7%, up 1.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily to higher ASPs partially offset by increased manufacturing and accruals. During the quarter we incurred $22.1 million of additional cost related to the manufacturing excursion that occurred from June 2008 to June of 2009. We have substantially concluded our remediation the associated with this manufacturing excursion. In addition, we accrued $16.2 million of expenses for Module replacement and related efforts primarily for modules that have been subject to certain installation and maintenance procedures by our customers outside of our recommended procedures. 
Module gross margin was 41.4%, up from Q2 2011 Module gross margin of 40.2%. Operating expenses were $26.1 million quarter-over-quarter. R&D was up $5.1 million quarter-over-quarter, representing a 15% growth as we increased investment efficiency improvements. SG&A was up $25.8 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to 2 charges. One was a $10.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts due to recent developments concerning the collectibility of past-due accounts receivables for our certain customer. The other one was $8.6 million for estimated sales expenses related to the previously mentioned manufacturing excursion. It is important to note that we did not take these charges because our estimate of percentage of modules with the defects from the manufacturing excursion has changed. The remains less than 4% of the models produced from June 2008 to June 2009. Rather these charges represent a higher than originally anticipated remediation costs and to support our value proposition and to increase customer satisfaction. Part of operating expenses production start up which declined by $4.8 million quarter-over-quarter mainly because Frankfurt-Oder 2 has completed start up. 
Operating income was $223 million, up $65 million from the second quarter. Driven by an increase modules sales into the Systems business. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 12.1% in the second quarter. Third quarter net income was $197 million or $2.25 per share on a fully diluted basis. This includes the $57.4 million of charges or $0.58 per share in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 11.8%. 
Now turning to Slide 11, I'll review the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and marketable securities were $795 million, up from $515 million at the end of the last quarter, as we received payments for several systems projects. Accounts receivable balance declined quarter-over-quarter as shipments were more linear this quarter than last. Our unbilled receivable increased primarily do significant growth in the North American Systems business and the timing of the project billing cycle has specified in those customer contracts. We attempt start of the contract and execute construction to align billing cycles, revenue recognition and cash flow. However, there may at times be nonalignment in these metrics primarily due to the application of various accounting rules which govern revenue recognition on system projects as the appeal in the public filings. Inventories increased for 3 main reasons. One, our increased EPC activity led to a higher level of modules and Balance of System it materials on-site. Two, finished goods inventory not associated with the systems business increased as we did not completely sell through our production during the quarter. And 3, our capacity expansion led to a higher level of raw materials and working process inventories. As we saw pipeline. As a reminder, when we sell a project, the project assets turn into either revenue for differed project costs. Depending on whether the applicable revenue recognition criteria has been met. Our debt levels increased to fund our plant expansions in Malaysia, in Germany and working capital for our Systems business. Operating cash flow was $203 million and free cash flow was positive $42 million. We spent $224 million for capital expenditures, up $47 million from last quarter. was $61 million, up slightly from last quarter. While cash flow was impacted by higher build accounts receivable, an increase inventory and higher higher CapEx, free cash flow was still positive, thanks to progress payments in our Systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to equity ratio of 15%. 
Moving to Slide 12. The project businesses and will continue to be a significant source of growth for First Solar. As the Project business typically involves real estate development, without it be helpful to summarize briefly some of the key real estate accounting revenue recognition criteria under current U.S. GAAP. There are 4 primary criteria which must be met to recognize revenue when a solar project may First Solar includes the transfer of real estate. First, conference consummation of the sales; second sufficient initial cash and cash equivalents season assurance of ongoing cash receipts. Third, of the usual risk or words of ownership; and finally, ability to estimate progress and costs to complete construction. 
As it relates to major projects, we have recently sold satisfied all of these criteria therefore recognize revenue via percentage of completion accounting principles and received cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. For ADSR 1, the ability has not get funded the loan because not all of the funding conditions have been satisfied. This is described in more detail in our 8-K filed September 30 of this year. We expect to begin revenue recognition at the initial BOE funding has occurred. This is a leg down expect revenue recognition until substantial completion mainly because we have not completed transferred all of the risk and rewards of ownership to the buyer as defined under real estate accounting rules. We have received cash payments and we will continue to receive cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. 
Slide 13, this brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several assumptions underlying our guidance. First, the spot exchange rate assumption is $1.40 per euro. As of today, a $0.1 change in the dollar U.S. spot rates but if that our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and our net income guidance by about $0.5 million. 
Our Module pricing is based in our estimate of the current competitive pricing environment. We plan to install a proxy 450-megawatt of DC systems projects in North America for the year. AVSR1 is not included in our financial guidance as the DOE has not yet closed the loan. Our capital spending is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam, in the U.S. while, we decided to postpone the commission of the Vietnam plant, we will still be spending capital at the plant in the fourth quarter to complete construction of the building. Slide 14 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to range from $3 billion to $3.4 billion. The new wrap cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $12 million, the pig factory set up real range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between $110 million and $120 million with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $650 million to $760 million. We expect to provide revised tax rate to be between 13% and 14% and our year-end 2011 fully diluted share count me 87 million shares to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to be in the range of $6.60 to %7.50. At the midpoint of the annual EPS range has been reduced by $2.20, $2.25 from prior guidance for several reasons. First, we no longer including a ABS 1 in our guidance. We expect third-party sales to be lower Q4 than we anticipated three months ago. Third, systems projects have slipped out of 2011 into the first quarter of 2012. And the new guidance includes the $57.4 million of charges that were incurred in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of $850 million, %850 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be a use of $200 million to break even. The decrease from prior guidance is primarily due to expected delays to system projects, cash actions and the timing of project completions which had moved out of the year into the first quarter of 2012. Also, lower Module price assumptions have reduced our operating cash flows. 
We are planning to hold our formal guidance for 2012 in December. While it's too early to provide much detail on 2012, we are basing our business plan on continued aggressive pricing by our competitors. That said, we are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for Module efficiency in cost improvements will enhance our competitive position in very challenging market. 
Last slide Now to summarize, we continue to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market and we remain focused on achieving our long-term mission while managing through a near-term risk in challenges. We are well-positioned to read future growth of the solar industry we are improving Module efficiency and costs to increase competitive advantages improving profitability and capital efficiency and developing new market opportunities. We are continuing to add to our systems pipeline, so the projects and execute in our 2.7 gigawatt ACE pipeline. We are investing in growth in the U.S., India, Middle East, Australia, South America and China. We're reallocating overhead into reducing CapEx to fund increased investment in market development, sales, R&D, and to improve operating margins. And our guidance reflects the more aggressive competitive environment partially offset by differentiated business model. With that said, we have completed our prepared remarks and I open the call for questions. Operator?"

But if you just step back for a second and say directionally, where are those markets going, Italy, well, it started with Spain, the Czech Republic, France, I think Italy and then Germany sort of the shock absorber. They're moving downward in terms of subsidies and overall market size, not upward.

That's not -- we wouldn't it go that business on an expectation that that's going to reverse itself or even stayed steady. I think it's going to go down. If you said, well, is that in the first half of '12 or could push out to '13? I can't. It's hard to handicap that from a timing point of view. But I just think what are the underlying forces that are driving change? They're pointing to downward pressure and subsidized markets. So what has to happen, yes, part of it is, new demand certainly has to be created. But if you're doing that without a feed-in tariff type program, which subsidizes the economics and creates a built-in customer, if you think about it, there's no marketing required at all. I mean, it's work but it's not marketing. If you're going to replace that, then you actually go find customers that have a need and you have to have a solution that's more fullsome than a panel or even a solar generating system. And it has to be priced at a level that will pull through wherever that might be. And so I think there's some heavy lifting to do here on new market creation. The second thing that has to happen is, at some point, market forces have to take effect and restrain supply. I mean, that's another one that's hard to handicap from a timing point of view. But I think we all believe it's economically not feasible to think this condition can last forever.

I continue to believe, to be optimistic about that and other projects in China based on the fact that there's a huge energy need there. The Chinese government is committed to building out a low carbon energy infrastructure. I really believe that and there is also a desire to move upstream on the technology curve. And I believe deep down and understanding that polysilicon simply does not scale at a level that will be relevant as an energy solution in a place like China. So we have something that's very useful to solve, to addressing needs in that market and those 2 things can be brought together. It just takes time and effort. But the short answer is, I'm still as optimistic now as I was when we started that work, we just need to really get after it."

I'd like to start by briefly addressing the CEO transition we announced last week. The board felt a leadership change was necessary in order for the company to navigate through the current market conditions and achieve its full potential. When hiring decisions do not work out, it's usually the result of the fit  between the employee and the position not being right as opposed to some particular shortcoming in the employee. And in this case, it was the fit that wasn't right, that's ultimately determined by the board and as the person who strongly influenced the hiring decision, I take responsibility for the choice we made. I know there's been a lot of speculation about whether it was some type of fraud or legal action, or government investigation or major operational problem behind the move, and I can tell you none of these things were part of the board deliberations. This was simply a question of fit. 
Now I'd like to move on and talk about the business. The team and I are working to our annual planning process now. In early December, we plan to discuss our 2012 annual operating plan and our updated strategy, we'll have specifics at that time. But in the meantime, let me provide you with an overview of how we're generally viewing the business. 
When we started First Solar in 1999, our mission was to make solar electricity a meaningful part of the electricity supply worldwide and to lead a whole new industry that would be self-sustaining both economically and environmentally. To accomplish that, we felt we must as a midterm goal established a platform for success and we defined that platform to include: First, the ability to profitably deliver solar electricity at a price as low as $100 a megawatt hour, which we believe would make solar economical almost everywhere in the world; second, a global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale in order to deliver meaningful quantities of solar to mass markets; and third, a close engagement with policymakers, regulators and customers worldwide to identify needs we could solve with solar power and drive a robust flow of innovative solutions to meet their needs. 
Today, much of this platform has been built. We have reduced module manufacturing cost per watt from $1.59 in 2005, which is our first full year of production, to $0.74 this past quarter. We're executing a plan to further reduce cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 a watt and increase conversion efficiencies from 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. We've also built a superior EPC capability where innovative designs and practices combined with scale has enabled us to reduce standard Balance of System cost from $1.56 per watt in 2008 to below $1 per watt today. And it's provided us with unique insights into the optimization of large power plant performance and reliability. Over the past year alone, we've reduced our time to build a representative 50 megawatts solar generation plant from 10 months to 7 months, and we're continuing to execute plans to reduce Balance of System cost and cycle times to defined targets through 2014. 
Now these cost reduction and conversion efficiency improvement plans are not without risk, but the plans are reasonable and the targets are feasible. And achieving these goals would enable us to price solar electricity for as low as $100 to $120 a megawatt hour, which makes solar electricity affordable in many parts of the world. We're also on -- we're on our way to building the second plank of the platform with global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale. Our module production capacity in North America, Europe and Asia enables us to produce and install multi-gigawatt of solar every year. We're continuing to localize our supply chain and to expand it beyond modules to balance the system components in order to continuously improve economics, speed and flexibility. 
And finally, we've innovated beyond the solar module to develop a diverse toolbox of solutions for our customers, including engineered systems, constructed systems, O&M services, project financing and end-of-life recycling. And we are developing additional solutions that will enable us to meet customer needs and open new markets. Underlying these accomplishments are a superior process technology and a strong culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement, which will allow us to continue the strong trajectory of innovation improvement that have been demonstrated in the past. 
In summary, the platform we set out to build when we started First Solar in 1999 largely exists today. So we're uniquely positioned to move into the next phase from mid-subsidy markets where we've operated in the past to becoming part of the mainstream electricity markets worldwide, which has always been our goal and the reason we formed this company. As we look to the future, we see significant opportunities to meet global energy needs with solar power. In the U.S. alone, the 300 gigawatt plus coal generation fleet is aging, over 2/3 of that fleet is more than 30 years old and much of it lacks meaningful environmental controls. We do not believe this generation will be replaced by new coal generation nor do we think most utilities, regulators or project financiers believe this will occur. Instead, the U.S. electricity generation mix will likely shift toward lower carbon solutions which will include some combinations of natural gas, renewable energy, and possibly, nuclear power in some communities. The opportunities to integrate affordable, reliable solar power solutions into this new energy infrastructure will be significant. In Europe, the mandate in Germany to shut all nuclear plants by 2022 and the EU objective of 20% renewables by 2020 will continue to drive demand for renewable energy including solar power. And we believe these programs will expand well beyond 2020. 
We also believe solar power has an integral role to play in addressing India's massive energy needs. Peak electricity generation capacity in India currently lag the demand and demand continues to grow robustly. Roughly 35% to 40% of the population in India lacks access to electricity and much of the electrified population depends on expensive diesel generation. India's high annual irradiance can be harnessed to help meet a significant part of these energy needs. We believe China will satisfy a meaningful amount of its massive future electricity demand from renewable energy sources, trading large demand for solar power. And as we look out into the future, we also see a number of other geographic markets where solar power can play an important role including developing countries, where roughly 2 billion people currently operate without access to electricity. 
So in summary, our operating platform and the tremendous global need for solar power give us confidence that our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity is not only vital but more attainable today than it has ever been. 
So in spite of these future prospects, the fact is that today, we operate in subsidized markets where the short-term prospects are not as attractive. The European countries that subsidize demand to enable the solar industry to scale to present level have been reducing their subsidies. In the U.S., there have been no significant new state-level solar programs in several years. And with solar industries feeding mostly off of legacy subsidies in California. At the same time, supply chain entry barriers for silicon have evaporated, leading to massive capacity buildup. Excess supply relative to demand has led to pricing and margin reduction because demand in the short-term is inelastic, and by that, I mean lower prices might enable a company to take more share with declining subsidy pool, but they won't increase aggregate demand. Because of that, returns on capital have also declined. 
So for First Solar the central task is to transition from these less attractive markets towards the market that will drive the future, and to do so in a manner that will allow for operational and financial stability. 
Now specifically, we must do the following things: First, go where we can solve pressing problems, that means places like India, the Middle East, North Africa and China. It also means building teams on the ground and engaging deeply with local customers and communities to identify and address their needs; second, develop innovative solutions anchored by our module, but extended beyond that to new technologies, system applications and offerings that are needed to solve real customer needs in ways that are both unique and compelling; third, form deep working relationships with the policymakers and regulators in these key geographic markets in order to develop market frameworks that will enable large-scale solar deployment. And fourth, price to levels that are required to drive demand without the need for significant solar subsidies. 
It's easy to talk about these things, executing them with a sense of urgency will be more difficult. These actions will cost money, they will take time and they will not yield massive results overnight. But this is the time for First Solar to move to the future and we're uniquely positioned to do this now. We have an extremely capable executive team, talented and committed associates and a highly supportive board and we're ready to move. As I think about why haven't we made more progress to date in expanding beyond traditional subsidized markets, I believe there are 3 things principally that have been holding us back. The first is inertia. The normal operating rhythm and comfort level of the organization has caused us to continue to allocate most of our resources to the legacy markets fed by a declining subsidy pool. So now we need to make hard shifts to the future and develop new markets. The second is short-term fixation with earnings per share. Operating to maximize GAAP EPS in the short term despite declining subsidy pools and massive oversupply is not a good strategy when it leads to suboptimizing investment in the future. Our decision-making needs to be guided by creation of long-term fundamental economic value rather than short-term financial metrics that depend on shrinking subsidy programs. The third is confusing factory expansion with growth. And we grow by identifying customers with pressing needs and serving them in ways that are compelling and unique. Building more factories absent this type of demand creation does not lead to growth. It prevents us from focusing on the right things to do. Our emphasis needs right now to be on creating new markets. 
So we'll provide more detail in December as we complete our 2012 strategic and operating plan. But directionally, you can expect these things. An emphasis on identifying and serving new customers in new geographic markets; deeper global engagement with policy makers, regulators and utilities to develop market frameworks that enable large-scale solar power; resource allocation that enables us to fund important growth programs, while maintaining financial soundness despite declining price levels; and finally, a slowdown in new factory expansion until new sustainable market demand develops. And in that regard, we've decided to postpone commissioning of Vietnam and we'll continue to study the rest of our capacity planning to ensure that it is in line with our demand. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to review our operational and financial results, and then update guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets is continuing to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe",2968,"Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. 
Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets is continuing to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe remains aggressive as module supply exceeds demand. During the third quarter, we worked with our customers to enable them to realize these great projects and adjusted our pricing to best position distributors to sell through in a challenging demand environment. In Q4, we are revising our framework contract pricing approach to eliminate the complexities of rebates and help enhance our customers' liquidity. 
Digging deeper into specific countries and geographies. First, Germany. The German market has seen a slowdown in demand, well into the third quarter and appears to be trending towards around 4 to 5 gigawatts in 2011. The recent EEG decision provides good long-term visibility and we are well positioned as the German manufacturer. In Italy, the market is adjusting to the new CE4 published in May and recovering from a policy interruption in the first half. Demand has been improving and is expected to be about 4 to 5 gigawatts by the end of the year. Second half demand is impacted by monthly digressions in feed-in tariffs and the upcoming restrictions on land use. In addition, we are seeing project financing constraining the sales channel. France has published details on tender mechanisms for large systems and the future incentive schemes for small installations, which provides sufficient long-term opportunity. In the short term, due to building grandfather projects, the French market should range from 1 to 1.4 gigawatts in 2011. 
As a reminder, as previously announced, our 2-line factory facility planned in France remains on indefinite hold. In Spain, the regulatory environment is very stable and provides good visibility. We expect that market will remain at about 500 megawatts in 2011. The North America market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California, over 1 gigawatts of RFOs were issued in it for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. And our vertical integrated model continues to position us well in North America. In China, growth in the market is driven by the national feed-in tariff of RMB 1.15 per kilowatt for projects completed before the end of the year and RMB 1 per kilowatt hour for projects completed after. We are focused on executing demonstration projects and building out diverse commercial relationships with the leading generation companies. In Australia, solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced National Carbon legislation, which is committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind, large-scale renewables and the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility scale projects. We had signed an agreement with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services to provide First Solar EPC capabilities to build Australia's first utility scale project PV. 
Mike highlighted our optimism on the market in India. The optimism is supported by our recently announced 100-megawatt module supply agreement with Reliance, one of India's leading independent producers. In Southeast Asia, we are seeing encouraging signs of early-stage developments in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we have seen great potential in the Middle East. We have submitted some bids for early tenders for utility scale projects and we expect to see more robust renewable policies that could drive a sizable market in a few years. 
Now moving on to operations on Slide 7. In Q3, our production was 551 megawatts, up 58% versus the prior year, and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by a full production from our new KLM 6 in Frankfurt-Oder 2 factories. A portion of this incremental production went to systems project construction, for which revenue had not yet been recognized. Annual capacity per line increased by 1 megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 63.1 megawatt. Our throughput increased as downtime was less than last quarter and we've begun to benefit from planned efficiency increases. Our average module efficiency was 11.8%, which is up 0.5 percentage point year-over-year and 0.1% quarter-over-quarter. Our best lines were operating at 12.4% efficiency in Q3, which was up 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. So far, for the fourth quarter, our platform is averaging 12%, which is 0.2% greater than last quarter. This gives us strong confidence we can continue to increase our efficiency over the short and long term. We also recently introduced 87 watt module into the market. Module manufacturing costs per watt was $0.74, which is down $0.01 quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher conversion efficiency. Core cost which excludes the ramp penalty and stock -based compensation was $0.73 per watt. We expect to drive our module costs down to the mid- '60s by the end of 2012, as we accelerate our efficiency roadmap by implementing the technology from the record 17.3% sale highlighted in our Q2 earnings call. 
Now we're moving to Slide 8. As we improve our operational capabilities, we have also strengthened our Systems business. Year-to-date, we have added 654-megawatt AC of contracts to our pipeline, including 222 megawatts AC in the third quarter. Recent additions were 130-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with Tenaska, a 66-megawatt EPC agreement with NRG and a 16-megawatt agreement with Constellation Energy, and 10-megawatt for our first utility scale project in Australia with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services. As our pipeline additions exceeded our megawatts installed, we have grown our pipeline to 2.7 gigawatts. In addition to adding to our pipeline, we are making progress in moving forward with existing projects on our pipeline. At Agua Caliente, we closed the sale to NRG early in the third quarter in conjunction with finalizing a DOE loan guarantee. We have now completed over 35% of the BoS and had installed over 1.4 million modules in Agua Caliente. 
Desert Sunlight as you know received a DOE loan guarantee and was sold to repeat customers, GE and NextEra.  AVSR1 also received a DOE loan guarantee and was sold to a new customer, Exelon Energy. As you know we ran out of time on Topaz to complete the DOE negotiations but we're in advanced negotiations with a buyer and expect to complete the sale over the next few months. 
These past few slides have shown that we are doing well and improving metrics we can control: increasing efficiency, reducing costs, increasing throughput and growing our systems pipeline. However, these improvements do not fully offset the sluggish demand and aggressive pricing environment. Therefore, we have decided to slowdown factory expansions, which we'll discuss on Slide 9. 
Looking at Slide 9. You have seen this slide -- a version of this slide in the past. There are 2 differences between this slide and the one presented last quarter. One, the new slide no longer includes Vietnam as we have postponed commissioning until new sustainable market development -- market demand develops. Two, we have increased throughput estimates for 2012 in response to module efficiency increases and other manufacturing improvements. We anticipate achieving capacity per line of 70 megawatts by the end of 2012. Regarding Mesa, we currently are on schedule for initial shipments in the third quarter of 2012. As you would anticipate, we will continue to study our 2012 demand need to ensure it aligns -- excuse me, 2012 capacity needs to ensure it aligns with our demand. 
Moving on to the financial portion of the presentation on Slide 10. Net sales for the second quarter were just over $1 billion, up $533 million from last quarter. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of North American systems business, which was highlighted by significant construction progress at Agua Caliente. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 11% of total net sales in the second quarter to 39% of net sales in the third quarter. Our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems business increased from 20% in the second quarter to 65% in the third quarter. Overall, ASPs increased 17% quarter-over-quarter due to a mix shift to more modules for systems, which were more than offset by an ASP decline of 8% quarter-over-quarter for third-party modules sales. 
Gross margin was 37.7%, up 1.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by increased manufacturing excursion accruals. During the quarter we incurred $22.1 million of additional cost related to the manufacturing excursion that occurred from June 2008 to June 2009. We have substantially concluded the remediation programs associated with this manufacturing excursion. In addition, we accrued $16.2 million of expenses for module replacement and related efforts, primarily for modules that have been subject to certain installation and maintenance procedures by our customers outside of our recommended procedures. 
Module gross margin was 41.4%, up from Q2 2011 module gross margin of 40.2%. Operating expenses were $26.1 million quarter-over-quarter. R&D was up $5.1 million quarter-over-quarter, representing a 15% growth as we increased investment efficiency improvements. SG&A was up $25.8 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to 2 charges. One was a $10.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts due to recent developments concerning the collectibility of past-due accounts receivables for a certain customer. The other one was an $8.6 million for estimated post-sales expenses related to the previously mentioned manufacturing excursion. It is important to note that we did not take these charges because our estimate of the percentage of modules with defects from the manufacturing excursion has changed. There remains still less than 4% of the models produced from June 2008 to June 2009. Rather these charges represent a higher than originally anticipated remediation costs and to support our value proposition and to increase customer satisfaction. The final component of operating expenses is production startup, which declined by $4.8 million quarter-over-quarter mainly because Frankfurt-Oder 2 has completed startup. 
Operating income was $223 million, up $65 million from the second quarter. Driven by an increase in module sales into the Systems business. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 12.1% in the second quarter. Third quarter net income was $197 million or $2.25 per share on a fully diluted basis. This includes the $57.4 million of charges or $0.58 per share in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 11.8%. 
Now turning to Slide 11, I'll review the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and marketable securities were $795 million, up from $515 million at the end of the last quarter, as we received payments for several systems projects. Accounts receivable trade balance declined quarter-over-quarter as shipments were more linear this quarter than last. Our unbilled receivable increased primarily due to significant growth in the North American Systems business and the timing of the project billing cycle as specified in those customer contracts. We attempt to structure contracts and execute construction to align billing cycles, revenue recognition and cash flow. However, there may, at times be nonalignment in these metrics primarily due to the application of various accounting rules, which govern revenue recognition on system projects as DOTL [ph] in the public filings. 
Inventories increased for 3 main reasons. One, our increased EPC activity led to a higher level of modules and Balance of System materials on site. Two, finished goods inventory not associated with the Systems business increased as we did not completely sell through our production during the quarter. And 3, our capacity expansion led to a higher level of raw materials and working process inventories. Project assets declined as we sold some of our project pipeline. As a reminder, when we sell a project, the project assets turn into either revenue or deferred project costs, depending on whether the applicable revenue recognition criteria has been met. Our debt levels increased to fund our plant expansions in Malaysia, in Germany and working capital for our Systems business. Operating cash flow was $203 million and free cash flow was positive $42 million. We spent $224 million for capital expenditures, up $47 million from last quarter. 
[Audio Gap] 
was $61 million, up slightly from last quarter. While cash flow was impacted by higher unbilled accounts receivable, an increase in the inventory and higher CapEx, free cash flow was still positive, thanks to progress payments in our Systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to equity ratio of 15%. 
Moving to Slide 12. The Project business is and will continue to be a significant source of growth for First Solar. As the Project business typically involves real estate development, we thought it would be helpful to summarize briefly some of the key real estate accounting revenue recognition criteria under current U.S. GAAP. There are 4 primary criteria which must be met to recognize revenue when a sale of a project by First Solar includes the transfer of real estate. First, consummation of the sales; second sufficient initial cash receipts and assurance of ongoing cash receipts. Third, transfer of the usual risk and rewards of ownership; and finally, ability to estimate progress and costs to complete construction. 
As it relates to major projects we have recently sold, Agua has satisfied all of these criteria, therefore, we recognize revenue via percentage of completion accounting principles and received cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. For AVSR 1, the DOE has not yet funded the loan because not all of the funding conditions have been satisfied. This is described in more detail in our 8-K filed September 30 of this year. We expect to begin revenue recognition after the initial DOE funding has occurred. At Desert Sunlight, we do not expect revenue recognition until substantial completion, mainly because we have not completely transferred all of the risk and rewards of ownership to the buyer as defined under real estate accounting rules. We have received cash payments and we will continue to receive cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. 
Slide 13, this brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several assumptions underlying our guidance. First, the spot exchange rate assumption is $1.40 per euro. As of today, a $0.1 change in the dollar/euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and our net income guidance by about $0.5 million. 
Our Module pricing is based in our estimate of the current competitive pricing environment. We plan to install approximately 450 megawatt DC of systems projects in North America for the year. AVSR1 is not included in our financial guidance as the DOE has not yet closed the loan. Our capital spending is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam and the U.S. while we've decided to postpone the commissioning in the Vietnam plant, we will still be spending capital at the plant in the fourth quarter to complete construction of the building. 
Slide 14 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to range from $3 billion to $3.4 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $12 million. The factory start-up expense will range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between $110 million and $120 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $650 million to $760 million. We expect the revised effective tax rate to be between 13% and 14% and our year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $7.50. 
The midpoint of the annual EPS range has been reduced by $2.25 from prior guidance for several reasons. First, we no longer included AVSR1 in our guidance. We expect modulated piece [ph] for third-party sales to be lower in Q4 than we anticipated 3 months ago. Third, some systems projects have slipped out of 2011 into the first quarter of 2012. And the new guidance includes the $57.4 million of charges that were incurred in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of $800 million and $850 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be a use of $200 million to breakeven. The decrease from prior guidance is primarily due to expected delays at system project cash collections and the timing of project completions, which had moved out of the year into the first quarter of 2012. Also, lower Module price assumptions have reduced our operating cash flows. 
We are planning to hold our formal guidance for 2012 in December. While it's too early to provide much detail on 2012, we are basing our business plan on continued aggressive pricing by our competitors. That said, we are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for Module efficiency in cost improvements, which will enhance our competitive position in a very challenging market. 
Last slide now. To summarize, we continue to execute in the quarter despite a challenge in European market and we remain focused on achieving our long-term mission while managing through the near-term risk and challenges. We are well positioned to lead the future growth of the solar industry, we are improving Module efficiency and costs to increase competitive advantages, improving profitability and capital efficiency and developing new market opportunities. We are continuing to add to our Systems pipeline, cell projects and executing our 2.7 gigawatt AC pipeline. We are investing for growth in the U.S., India, Middle East, Australia, South America and China. We are reallocating overhead and reducing CapEx to fund increased investments in market development, sales, R&D and to improve operating margins. And our guidance reflects the more aggressive competitive environment, partially offset by a differentiated business model. With that said, we have completed our prepared remarks and I open the call for questions. Operator?"

But look, directionally, I think, the way we're thinking about this in various markets is we've got a toolbox that ranges from selling a module to something more along the lines of the Project business, and as subsidy levels diminish in margins for us, we've got to be more opportunistic in terms of how we reach into that toolbox. So there's a broader role for a project-type offering to play, not just in the U.S. but across markets, and we're really going to try to harmonize our thinking. Basically, think about this a little more holistically, as opposed to we've got a Project business and then we're selling panels, we're going to think more about what does it take in a given market to drive growth trajectories and reasonable economics and then we'll back into the right offering and business model. So that's -- so that may give you a little insight into the thinking and why we need to get a better bottoms-up look at some of these markets and plan it before we can give you an accurate range."

That's one. And on the coal cost per watt, that number has been flat for the last 4 quarters with $0.73 and even if I go back 7 quarters, it's down just a couple of pennies.

And then we communicated last quarter that our best line, I think, was actually sub $0.70, right? And so we know we have the ability within the platform. It's a matter of scaling the consistency across the platform, driving to the higher efficiency and the costs will come down, right? So when we do the math, and it's very predictable to do the math in understanding the improvement and the benefit of the efficiency gains have on the cost per watt, so we're very confident and, as we said in our release, we will exit 2012 with a cost per watt in the mid '60s, right? And we know we can get there with our efficiency. We've demonstrated our capability in our best line to getting the cost down to that level, so we're very comfortable with making that statement at this point in time. I think the other question you had was on Q4 and where crystalline silicon guys are pricing and how we're thinking about it. Yes, clearly, our ability to sell-through is always reflective of relative price position, and we will make sure that we are in price position to sell through. We will obviously have the advantage of our U.S. VG, our Systems pipeline. The activity in those projects is starting to ramp now, so we'll be able to absorb a significant amount of our Q4 production into our Systems business. So at this point in time, we will continue to run our operations at capacity because we have underlying demand. As we look forward, if we see any changes into that profile then we'll have to reassess but at this point in time, given the backlog we have with U.S. VG and demand we have on third-party Module sales, it requires a full capacity production."

But if you just step back for a second and see directionally where are those markets going, Italy -- well, it started with Spain, the Czech Republic, France, I think Italy and then Germany sort of have been the shock absorber.

I mean, there's not -- not in the short term -- I mean, not in a -- not as long as the market's created by subsidy programs. That's not -- we wouldn't build our business on an expectation that that's going to reverse itself or even stay at steady. I think it's going to go down. If you said, well, is that in the first half of '12 or could push out to '13? I can't -- it's hard to handicap that from a timing point of view, but I just think what's -- what are the underlying forces that are driving change, they're pointing to downward pressure and subsidized markets. So what has to happen yet, part of it is new demand certainly has to be created. But if you're doing that without a feed-in tariff-type program, which subsidizes the economics and creates a built-in customer, if you think about it, there's no marketing required at all. I mean, it's work but it's not marketing. If you're going to replace that, then you actually got to go find customers that have a need and you have to have a solution that's more full some than a panel or even a solar generating system. And it has to be priced at a level that will pull through wherever that might be. And so I think there's some heavy lifting to do here on new market creation. The second thing that has to happen is, at some point, market forces have to take effect and restrain supply. I mean, that's another one that's hard to handicap from a timing point of view, but I think we all believe it's economically not feasible to think this condition can last forever. And there will be a correction because there are debt and we just -- we need to be very vigilant about how to write through that situation and then build these new markets."

I'd like to start by briefly addressing the CEO transition we announced last week. The board felt a leadership change was necessary in order for the company to navigate through the current market conditions and achieve its full potential. When hiring decisions do not work out, it's usually the result of the fit between the employee and the position not being right as opposed to some particular shortcoming in the employee. And in this case, it was the fit that wasn't right, that's ultimately determined by the board and as the person who strongly influenced the hiring decision, I take responsibility for the choice we made. I know there's been a lot of speculation about whether it was some type of fraud or legal action, or government investigation or major operational problem behind the move, and I can tell you none of these things were part of the board deliberations. This was simply a question of fit. 
Now I'd like to move on and talk about the business. The team and I are working to our annual planning process now. In early December, we plan to discuss our 2012 annual operating plan and our updated strategy, we'll have specifics at that time. But in the meantime, let me provide you with an overview of how we're generally viewing the business. 
When we started First Solar in 1999, our mission was to make solar electricity a meaningful part of the electricity supply worldwide and to lead a whole new industry that would be self-sustaining both economically and environmentally. To accomplish that, we felt we must, as a midterm goal, establish a platform for success and we defined that platform to include: First, the ability to profitably deliver solar electricity at a price as low as $100 a megawatt hour, which we believe would make solar economical almost everywhere in the world; second, a global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale in order to deliver meaningful quantities of solar to mass markets; and third, a close engagement with policymakers, regulators and customers worldwide to identify needs we could solve with solar power and drive a robust flow of innovative solutions to meet their needs. 
Today, much of this platform has been built. We have reduced module manufacturing cost per watt from $1.59 in 2005, which is our first full year of production, to $0.74 this past quarter. We're executing a plan to further reduce cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 a watt and increase conversion efficiencies from 13.5% to 14.5% by the end of 2014. We've also built a superior EPC capability where innovative designs and practices combined with scale has enabled us to reduce standard Balance of System cost from $1.56 per watt in 2008 to below $1 per watt today. And it's provided us with unique insights into the optimization of large power plant performance and reliability. Over the past year alone, we've reduced our time to build a representative 50 megawatts solar generation plant from 10 months to 7 months, and we're continuing to execute plans to reduce Balance of System cost and cycle times to defined targets through 2014. 
Now these cost reduction and conversion efficiency improvement plans are not without risk, but the plans are reasonable and the targets are feasible. And achieving these goals would enable us to price solar electricity for as low as $100 to $120 a megawatt hour, which makes solar electricity affordable in many parts of the world. We're also on -- we're well on our way to building the second plank of the platform with global supply chain capable of operating at multi-gigawatt scale. Our module production capacity in North America, Europe and Asia enables us to produce and install multi-gigawatt of solar every year. We're continuing to localize our supply chain and to expand it beyond modules to balance the system components in order to continuously improve economics, speed and flexibility. 
And finally, we've innovated beyond the solar module to develop a diverse toolbox of solutions for our customers, including engineered systems, constructed systems, O&M services, project financing and end-of-life recycling. And we are developing additional solutions that will enable us to meet customer needs and open in new markets. Underlying these accomplishments are a superior process technology and a strong culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement, which will allow us to continue the strong trajectory of innovation improvement that have been demonstrated in the past. 
In summary, the platform we set out to build when we started First Solar in 1999 largely exists today. We’re uniquely positioned to move into the next phase from mid-subsidy markets where we've operated in the past to becoming part of the mainstream electricity markets worldwide, which has always been our goal and the reason we formed this company. As we look to the future, we see significant opportunities to meet global energy needs with solar power. In the U.S. alone, the 300 gigawatt plus coal generation fleet is aging, over 2/3 of that fleet is more than 30 years old and much of it lacks meaningful environmental controls. We do not believe this generation will be replaced by new coal generation, nor do we think most utilities, regulators or project financiers believe this will occur. Instead, the U.S. electricity generation mix will likely shift toward lower carbon solutions which will include some combinations of natural gas, renewable energy, and possibly, nuclear power in some communities. The opportunities to integrate affordable, reliable solar power solutions into this new energy infrastructure will be significant. In Europe, the mandate in Germany to shut all nuclear plants by 2022 and the EU objective of 20% renewables by 2020 will continue to drive demand for renewable energy including solar power. And we believe these programs will expand well beyond 2020. 
We also believe solar power has an integral role to play in addressing India's massive energy needs. Peak electricity generation capacity in India currently lag demand and demand continues to grow robustly. Roughly 35% to 40% of the population in India lacks access to electricity and much of the electrified population depends on expensive diesel generation. India's high annual irradiance can be harnessed to help meet a significant part of these energy needs. We believe China will satisfy a meaningful amount of its massive future electricity demand from renewable energy sources, trading large demand for solar power. And as we look out into the future, we also see a number of other geographic markets where solar power can play an important role including developing countries, where roughly 2 billion people currently operate without access to electricity. 
So in summary, our operating platform and the tremendous global need for solar power give us confidence that our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity is not only vital but more attainable today than it has ever been. 
So in spite of these future prospects, the fact is that today, we operate in subsidized markets where the short-term prospects are not as attractive. The European countries that subsidize demand to enable the solar industry to scale to present level have been reducing their subsidies. In the U.S., there have been no significant new state-level solar programs in several years. And with solar industries feeding mostly off of legacy subsidies in California. At the same time, supply chain entry barriers for silicon have evaporated, leading to massive capacity buildup. Excess supply relative to demand has led to pricing and margin reduction because demand in the short-term is inelastic, and by that, I mean lower prices might enable a company to take more share with declining subsidy pool, but they won't increase aggregate demand. Because of that, returns on capital have also declined. 
So for First Solar the central task is to transition from these less attractive markets towards the market that will drive the future, and to do so in a manner that will allow for operational and financial stability. 
Now specifically, we must do the following things: First, go where we can solve pressing problems, that means places like India, the Middle East, North Africa and China. It also means building teams on the ground and engaging deeply with local customers and communities to identify and address their needs; second, develop innovative solutions anchored by our module, but extended beyond that to new technologies, system applications and offerings that are needed to solve real customer needs in ways that are both unique and compelling; third, form deep working relationships with the policymakers and regulators in these key geographic markets in order to develop market frameworks that will enable large-scale solar deployment. And fourth, price to levels that are required to drive demand without the need for significant solar subsidies. 
It's easy to talk about these things, executing them with a sense of urgency will be more difficult. These actions will cost money, they will take time and they will not yield massive results overnight. But this is the time for First Solar to move to the future and we're uniquely positioned to do this now. We have an extremely capable executive team, talented and committed associates and a highly supportive board and we're ready to move. As I think about why haven't we made more progress to date in expanding beyond traditional subsidized markets, I believe there are 3 things principally that have been holding us back. The first is inertia. The normal operating rhythm and comfort level of the organization has caused us to continue to allocate most of our resources to the legacy markets fed by a declining subsidy pool. So now we need to make hard shifts to the future and develop new markets. The second is short-term fixation with earnings per share. Operating to maximize GAAP EPS in the short term despite declining subsidy pools and massive oversupply is not a good strategy when it leads to suboptimizing investment in the future. Our decision-making needs to be guided by creation of long-term fundamental economic value rather than short-term financial metrics that depend on shrinking subsidy programs. The third is confusing factory expansion with growth. And we grow by identifying customers with pressing needs and serving them in ways that are compelling and unique. Building more factories absent this type of demand creation does not lead to growth. It prevents us from focusing on the right things to do. Our emphasis needs right now to be on creating new markets. 
So we'll provide more detail in December as we complete our 2012 strategic and operating plan. But directionally, you can expect these things. An emphasis on identifying and serving new customers in new geographic markets; deeper global engagement with policy makers, regulators and utilities to develop market frameworks that enable large-scale solar power; resource allocation that enables us to fund important growth programs, while maintaining financial soundness despite declining price levels; and finally, a slowdown in new factory expansion until new sustainable market demand develops. And in that regard, we've decided to postpone commissioning of Vietnam and we continue to study the rest of our capacity planning to ensure that it is in line with our demand. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to review our operational and financial results, and then update guidance for 2011. Mark?"

Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets is continuing to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe",2969,"Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and I'm going to start with Slide 6 on the current market conditions. 
Overall in 2011, we believe demand in the major European solar markets is continuing to improve after a very weak first half. However, pricing in Europe remains aggressive as module supply exceeds demand. During the third quarter, we worked with our customers to enable them to realize these great projects and adjusted our pricing to best position distributors to sell through in a challenging demand environment. In Q4, we are revising our framework contract pricing approach to eliminate the complexities of rebates and help enhance our customers' liquidity. 
Digging deeper into specific countries and geographies. First, Germany. The German market has seen a slowdown in demand, well into the third quarter and appears to be trending towards around 4 to 5 gigawatts in 2011. The recent EEG decision provides good long-term visibility and we are well positioned as the German manufacturer. In Italy, the market is adjusting to the new CE4 published in May and recovering from a policy interruption in the first half. Demand has been improving and is expected to be about 4 to 5 gigawatts by the end of the year. Second half demand is impacted by monthly digressions in feed-in tariffs and the upcoming restrictions on land use. In addition, we are seeing project financing constraining the sales channel. France has published details on tender mechanisms for large systems and the future incentive schemes for small installations, which provides sufficient long-term opportunity. In the short term, due to building grandfather projects, the French market should range from 1 to 1.4 gigawatts in 2011. 
As a reminder, as previously announced, our 2-line factory facility planned in France remains on indefinite hold. In Spain, the regulatory environment is very stable and provides good visibility. We expect that market will remain at about 500 megawatts in 2011. The North America market should double to more than 2 gigawatts this year. In California, over 1 gigawatts of RFOs were issued in it for the 2011 cycle to comply with the 33% RPS requirement. And our vertical integrated model continues to position us well in North America. In China, growth in the market is driven by the national feed-in tariff of RMB 1.15 per kilowatt for projects completed before the end of the year, and RMB 1 per kilowatt hour for projects completed after. We are focused on executing demonstration projects and building out diverse commercial relationships with the leading generation companies. In Australia, solar growth will be strongly supported in the future by the recently announced National Carbon legislation, which is committed to invest $10 billion in non-wind, large-scale renewables and the implementation of state solar programs targeting utility scale projects. We had signed an agreement with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services to provide First Solar EPC capabilities to build Australia's first utility scale project PV. 
Mike highlighted our optimism on the market in India. The optimism is supported by our recently announced 100-megawatt module supply agreement with Reliance, one of India's leading independent producers. In Southeast Asia, we are seeing encouraging signs of early-stage developments in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Finally, we have seen great potential in the Middle East. We have submitted some bids for early tenders for utility scale projects and we expect to see more robust renewable policies that could drive a sizable market in a few years. 
Now moving on to operations on Slide 7. In Q3, our production was 551 megawatts, up 58% versus the prior year, and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by a full production from our new KLM 6 in Frankfurt-Oder 2 factories. A portion of this incremental production went to systems project construction, for which revenue had not yet been recognized. Annual capacity per line increased by 1 megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 63.1 megawatt. Our throughput increased as downtime was less than last quarter and we've begun to benefit from planned efficiency increases. Our average module efficiency was 11.8%, which is up 0.5 percentage point year-over-year and 0.1% quarter-over-quarter. Our best lines were operating at 12.4% efficiency in Q3, which was up 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. So far, for the fourth quarter, our platform is averaging 12%, which is 0.2% greater than last quarter. This gives us strong confidence we can continue to increase our efficiency over the short and long term. We also recently introduced 87 watt module into the market. Module manufacturing costs per watt was $0.74, which is down $0.01 quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher conversion efficiency. Core cost which excludes the ramp penalty and stock -based compensation was $0.73 per watt. We expect to drive our module costs down to the mid- '60s by the end of 2012, as we accelerate our efficiency roadmap by implementing the technology from the record 17.3% sale highlighted in our Q2 earnings call. 
Now we're moving to Slide 8. As we improve our operational capabilities, we have also strengthened our Systems business. Year-to-date, we have added 654-megawatt AC of contracts to our pipeline, including 222 megawatts AC in the third quarter. Recent additions were 130-megawatt AC, EPC agreement with Tenaska, a 66-megawatt EPC agreement with NRG and a 16-megawatt agreement with Constellation Energy, and 10-megawatt for our first utility scale project in Australia with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services. As our pipeline additions exceeded our megawatts installed, we have grown our pipeline to 2.7 gigawatts. In addition to adding to our pipeline, we are making progress in moving forward with existing projects in our pipeline. At Agua Caliente, we closed the sale to NRG early in the third quarter in conjunction with finalizing a DOE loan guarantee. We have now completed over 35% of the BoS and had installed over 1.4 million modules in Agua Caliente. 
Desert Sunlight as you know received a DOE loan guarantee and was sold to repeat customers, GE and NextEra.  AVSR1 also received a DOE loan guarantee and was sold to a new customer, Exelon Energy. As you know we ran out of time on Topaz to complete the DOE negotiations but we're in advanced negotiations with a buyer and expect to complete the sale over the next few months. 
These past few slides have shown that we are doing well and improving metrics we can control: increasing efficiency, reducing costs, increasing throughput and growing our systems pipeline. However, these improvements do not fully offset the sluggish demand and aggressive pricing environment. Therefore, we have decided to slowdown factory expansions, which we'll discuss on Slide 9. 
Looking at Slide 9. You have seen this slide -- a version of this slide in the past. There are 2 differences between this slide and the one presented last quarter. One, the new slide no longer includes Vietnam as we have postponed commissioning until new sustainable market development -- market demand develops. Two, we have increased throughput estimates for 2012 in response to module efficiency increases and other manufacturing improvements. We anticipate achieving capacity per line of 70 megawatts by the end of 2012. Regarding Mesa, we currently are on schedule for initial shipments in the third quarter of 2012. As you would anticipate, we will continue to study our 2012 demand need to ensure it aligns -- excuse me, 2012 capacity needs to ensure it aligns with our demand. 
Moving on to the financial portion of the presentation on Slide 10. Net sales for the second quarter were just over $1 billion, up $533 million from last quarter. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of North American systems business, which was highlighted by significant construction progress at Agua Caliente. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 11% of total net sales in the second quarter to 39% of net sales in the third quarter. Our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems business increased from 20% in the second quarter to 65% in the third quarter. Overall, ASPs increased 17% quarter-over-quarter due to a mix shift to more modules for systems, which were more than offset by an ASP decline of 8% quarter-over-quarter for third-party modules sales. 
Gross margin was 37.7%, up 1.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by increased manufacturing excursion accruals. During the quarter we incurred $22.1 million of additional cost related to the manufacturing excursion that occurred from June 2008 to June 2009. We have substantially concluded the remediation programs associated with this manufacturing excursion. In addition, we accrued $16.2 million of expenses for module replacement and related efforts, primarily for modules that have been subject to certain installation and maintenance procedures by our customers outside of our recommended procedures. 
Module gross margin was 41.4%, up from Q2 2011 module gross margin of 40.2%. Operating expenses were $26.1 million quarter-over-quarter. R&D was up $5.1 million quarter-over-quarter, representing a 15% growth as we increased investment efficiency improvements. SG&A was up $25.8 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to 2 charges. One was a $10.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts due to recent developments concerning the collectibility of past-due accounts receivables for a certain customer. The other one was an $8.6 million for estimated post-sales expenses related to the previously mentioned manufacturing excursion. It is important to note that we did not take these charges because our estimate of the percentage of modules with defects from the manufacturing excursion has changed. There remains still less than 4% of the models produced from June 2008 to June 2009. Rather these charges represent a higher than originally anticipated remediation costs and to support our value proposition and to increase customer satisfaction. The final component of operating expenses is production startup, which declined by $4.8 million quarter-over-quarter mainly because Frankfurt-Oder 2 has completed startup. 
Operating income was $223 million, up $65 million from the second quarter. Driven by an increase in module sales into the Systems business. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 12.1% in the second quarter. Third quarter net income was $197 million or $2.25 per share on a fully diluted basis. This includes the $57.4 million of charges or $0.58 per share in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 11.8%. 
Now turning to Slide 11, I'll review the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and marketable securities were $795 million, up from $515 million at the end of the last quarter, as we received payments for several systems projects. Accounts receivable trade balance declined quarter-over-quarter as shipments were more linear this quarter than last. Our unbilled receivable increased primarily due to significant growth in the North American Systems business and the timing of the project billing cycle as specified in those customer contracts. We attempt to structure contracts and execute construction to align billing cycles, revenue recognition and cash flow. However, there may, at times be nonalignment in these metrics primarily due to the application of various accounting rules, which govern revenue recognition on system projects as DOTL [ph] in the public filings. 
Inventories increased for 3 main reasons. One, our increased EPC activity led to a higher level of modules and Balance of System materials on site. Two, finished goods inventory not associated with the Systems business increased as we did not completely sell through our production during the quarter. And 3, our capacity expansion led to a higher level of raw materials and working process inventories. Project assets declined as we sold some of our project pipeline. As a reminder, when we sell a project, the project assets turn into either revenue or deferred project costs, depending on whether the applicable revenue recognition criteria has been met. Our debt levels increased to fund our plant expansions in Malaysia, in Germany and working capital for our Systems business. Operating cash flow was $203 million and free cash flow was positive $42 million. We spent $224 million for capital expenditures, up $47 million from last quarter. 
[Audio Gap] 
was $51 million, up slightly from last quarter. While cash flow was impacted by higher unbilled accounts receivable, an increase in the inventory and higher CapEx, free cash flow was still positive, thanks to progress payments in our Systems business. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to equity ratio of 15%. 
Moving to Slide 12. The Project business is and will continue to be a significant source of growth for First Solar. As the Project business typically involves real estate development, we thought it would be helpful to summarize briefly some of the key real estate accounting revenue recognition criteria under current U.S. GAAP. There are 4 primary criteria which must be met to recognize revenue when a sale of a project by First Solar includes the transfer of real estate. First, consummation of the sales; second sufficient initial cash receipts and assurance of ongoing cash receipts. Third, transfer of the usual risk and rewards of ownership; and finally, ability to estimate progress and costs to complete construction. 
As it relates to major projects we have recently sold, Agua has satisfied all of these criteria, therefore, we recognize revenue via percentage of completion accounting principles and received cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. For AVSR 1, the DOE has not yet funded the loan because not all of the funding conditions have been satisfied. This is described in more detail in our 8-K filed September 30 of this year. We expect to begin revenue recognition after the initial DOE funding has occurred. At Desert Sunlight, we do not expect revenue recognition until substantial completion, mainly because we have not completely transferred all of the risk and rewards of ownership to the buyer as defined under real estate accounting rules. We have received cash payments and we will continue to receive cash payments upon achieving contract milestones. 
Slide 13, this brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We have made several assumptions underlying our guidance. First, the spot exchange rate assumption is $1.40 per euro. As of today, a $0.1 change in the dollar/euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $1 million and our net income guidance by about $0.5 million. 
Our Module pricing is based in our estimate of the current competitive pricing environment. We plan to install approximately 450 megawatt DC of systems projects in North America for the year. AVSR1 is not included in our financial guidance as the DOE has not yet closed the loan. Our capital spending is primarily for capacity expansion in Vietnam and the U.S. while we've decided to postpone the commissioning in the Vietnam plant, we will still be spending capital at the plant in the fourth quarter to complete construction of the building. 
Slide 14 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to range from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $12 million. The factory start-up expense will range from $35 million to $40 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between $110 million and $120 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $650 million to $760 million. We expect the revised effective tax rate to be between 13% and 14% and our year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $7.50. 
The midpoint of the annual EPS range has been reduced by $2.25 from prior guidance for several reasons. First, we no longer are including AVSR1 in our guidance. We expect modulated piece [ph] for third-party sales to be lower in Q4 than we anticipated 3 months ago. Third, some systems projects have slipped out of 2011 into the first quarter of 2012. And the new guidance includes the $57.4 million of charges that were incurred in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of $800 million and $850 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be a use of $200 million to breakeven. The decrease from prior guidance is primarily due to expected delays at system project cash collections and the timing of project completions, which had moved out of the year into the first quarter of 2012. Also, lower Module price assumptions have reduced our operating cash flows. 
We are planning to hold our formal guidance for 2012 in December. While it's too early to provide much detail on 2012, we are basing our business plan on continued aggressive pricing by our competitors. That said, we are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for Module efficiency in cost improvements, which will enhance our competitive position in a very challenging market. 
Last slide now. To summarize, we continue to execute in the quarter despite a challenge in European market and we remain focused on achieving our long-term mission while managing through the near-term risk and challenges. We are well positioned to lead the future growth of the solar industry, we are improving Module efficiency and costs to increase competitive advantages, improving profitability and capital efficiency and developing new market opportunities. We are continuing to add to our Systems pipeline, cell projects and executing our 2.7 gigawatt AC pipeline. We are investing for growth in the U.S., India, Middle East, Australia, South America and China. We are reallocating overhead and reducing CapEx to fund increased investments in market development, sales, R&D and to improve operating margins. And our guidance reflects the more aggressive competitive environment, partially offset by a differentiated business model. With that said, we have completed our prepared remarks and I open the call for questions. Operator?"

But look, directionally, I think, the way we're thinking about this in various markets is we've got a toolbox that ranges from selling a module to something more along the lines of the Project business, and as subsidy levels diminish in margins for us, we've got to be more opportunistic in terms of how we reach into that toolbox. So there's a broader role for a project-type offering to play, not just in the U.S. but across markets, and we're really going to try to harmonize our thinking. Basically, think about this a little more holistically, as opposed to we've got a Project business and then we're selling panels, we're going to think more about what does it take in a given market to drive growth trajectories and reasonable economics and then we'll back into the right offering and business model. So that's -- so that may give you a little insight into the thinking and why we need to get a better bottoms-up look at some of these markets and plan it before we can give you an accurate range."

And then we communicated last quarter that our best line, I think, was actually sub $0.70, right? And so we know we have the ability within the platform. It's a matter of scaling the consistency across the platform, driving to the higher efficiency and the costs will come down, right? So when we do the math, and it's very predictable to do the math in understanding the improvement and the benefit of the efficiency gains have on the cost per watt, so we're very confident and, as we said in our release, we will exit 2012 with a cost per watt in the mid '60s, right? And we know we can get there with our efficiency. We've demonstrated our capability in our best line to getting the cost down to that level, so we're very comfortable with making that statement at this point in time. I think the other question you had was on Q4 and where crystalline silicon guys are pricing and how we're thinking about it. Yes, clearly, our ability to sell-through is always reflective of relative price position, and we will make sure that we are in price position to sell through. We will obviously have the advantage of our U.S. VG, our Systems pipeline. The activity in those projects is starting to ramp now, so we'll be able to absorb a significant amount of our Q4 production into our Systems business. So at this point in time, we will continue to run our operations at capacity because we have underlying demand. As we look forward, if we see any changes into that profile then we'll have to reassess but at this point in time, given the backlog we have with U.S. VG and demand we have on third-party Module sales, it requires a full capacity production."

But if you just step back for a second and see directionally where are those markets going, Italy -- well, it started with Spain, the Czech Republic, France, I think Italy and then Germany sort of have been the shock absorber. They're moving downward in terms of subsidies and overall market size, not upward, and I don't see that changing. I mean, there's not -- not in the short term -- I mean, not in a -- not as long as the market's created by subsidy programs. That's not -- we wouldn't build our business on an expectation that that's going to reverse itself or even stay at steady. I think it's going to go down. If you said, well, is that in the first half of '12 or could push out to '13? I can't -- it's hard to handicap that from a timing point of view, but I just think what's -- what are the underlying forces that are driving change, they're pointing to downward pressure and subsidized markets. So what has to happen yet, part of it is new demand certainly has to be created. But if you're doing that without a feed-in tariff-type program, which subsidizes the economics and creates a built-in customer, if you think about it, there's no marketing required at all. I mean, it's work but it's not marketing. If you're going to replace that, then you’ve actually got to go find customers that have a need and you have to have a solution that's more full some than a panel or even a solar generating system. And it has to be priced at a level that will pull through wherever that might be. And so I think there's some heavy lifting to do here on new market creation. The second thing that has to happen is, at some point, market forces have to take effect and restrain supply. I mean, that's another one that's hard to handicap from a timing point of view, but I think we all believe it's economically not feasible to think this condition can last forever. And there will be a correction because there are debt and we just -- we need to be very vigilant about how to ride through that situation and then build these new markets."

Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 mi",778,"Great. Thank you, Larry, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get into it here. We'll talk about the market, as well as our financial performance. So first, we had a solid quarter with net sales of $567 million. The first quarter net income was $116 million or 20.4% of net sales, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.33. Return on net assets was 17% on a 4-quarter rolling basis, representing an EVA of approximately 5% in line with our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance is $713 million, decreased $400 million sequentially, as we invested in CapEx and new factories, paid down $100 million of debt and began construction at several systems and system projects, as well as funded our recycling program.
The Q1 production was 407 megawatts, up 26% versus the prior year. And up 3% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by the production ramp of the KLM 5 factory and improved by conversion efficiency, partially offset by 7 fewer calendar days than in the fourth quarter. The annual capacity per line increased by 1.5-megawatt quarter-over-quarter to 64.1-megawatt. Our conversion efficiency was 11.7%, which is up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year and in line with our roadmap. As a result of continuous improvement in efficiency and process, we recently released our series 3, 85-watt module for higher efficiency applications. The module manufacturing cost per watt was $0.75 which is flat quarter-over-quarter. The benefit of increased efficiency and material cost reductions were offset by factory ramp costs and fewer calendar days. Core costs which excludes the ramp penalty and stock-based compensation was $0.73 per watt, down 9% year-over-year in line with our cost reduction roadmap.
To summarize our capacity build out, in March, we announced Mesa, Arizona as the location for our previously announced 4-line manufacturing plant in the United States with expected production ramp in the third quarter of 2012. Construction of our Vietnam site is progressing on schedule for shipments in the third quarter of 2012. Malaysia 5 reached full production by the end of the first quarter and Malaysia 6 is ramping in Q2 of 2011. Frankfurt Oder 2 remains on plan for third quarter ramp this year. Our 2-line factory in France remains on indefinite hold, so we have removed it from our 20 [ph] capacity plan, pending further clarity on the tender process for projects in France.
Moving to Page 7. In market development, we are focused on executing our North American systems pipeline, managing through European market uncertainty and developing new markets. We are expanding market diversity, growing pipelines and maintaining our technology leadership and business model flexibility to increase our visibility in 2011 and beyond. In North America, we began to execute on the 450-megawatt DC of planned 2011 systems builds, including Agua Caliente, several projects in Ontario, as well as Santa Teresa, PNM and Paloma. The Agua Caliente DOE loan guarantee is progressing, and we expect the financing to close in late Q2 or early Q3. Topaz received its final environmental impact report, and the Bureau of Land Management issued the final environmental impact statement for desert site sunlight in April.
In Europe, we're managing through a market uncertainty due to FiT and policy changes. Ambiguity about the magnitude of Germany's midyear FiT digression, lack of clarity with respect to France's tender process and Italy's delayed implementation of the new decree, all created uncertainties about project economics and financing. Industry channels are adversely impacted by the lack of transparency around pending policy revisions or contemplated FiT changes. 
We're making progress in developing the Indian, Australian and Chinese markets. Our pipeline in India has the potential to drive more than 100 megawatts of shipments in 2011, up from 10 megawatts in 2010. In China, we are discussing additional agreements with leading Chinese generating companies. We also announced that we will begin to offer our modules for installations as small as 10 kilowatts in response to customer demand, having previously limited availability to 30 kilowatt systems. About a third of our modules are currently installed on rooftops around the world and this expands our offering in this growing market segment, giving our current customers more flexibility and provides access to a new range of customers, which should further diversify our sales mix.
During Q1, we've hired a new CFO, Mark Widmar. Mark joined us in early April, and he's proving to be a quick study. Mark brings nearly 25 years of experience in finance and accounting to First Solar. His broad technology and industrial background will be an asset as we continue to scale. Mark, please say a few words"

On Page 9, you can see some of the project type activity in the first quarter. We delivered the 5-megawatt Tilbury site to Enbridge and completed the 2-megawatt Greece [ph] project for PNM in the first quarter",2230,"Great. Thanks, Mark, and welcome to the team. On Page 9, you can see some of the project type activity in the first quarter. We delivered the 5-megawatt Tilbury site to Enbridge and completed the 2-megawatt Greece [ph] project for PNM in the first quarter. Greece [ph] is the first of 5 we are building for PNM. We continued site work on Agua Caliente and we expect to begin module installation in the third quarter. The 20-megawatt Santa Teresa project is under construction and is our first project resulting in the conversion of a CSP site to PV, and the first to employ trackers to increase energy yield.
The next slide lists the projects in our contracted pipeline in North America. We highlighted the projects in green for which execution has begun in 2011. Our current North American pipeline is 2.4 gigawatts AC of PPA, EPC, on Ontario RESOP contracted projects. We plan to execute on about 450-megawatt DC with contributions from a dozen projects in 2011, up from 3 in 2010. And we currently have the flexibility to build to up to 600 megawatt DC in 2011. We expect to sign new EPC agreements to continue adding to our contracted pipeline developed by First Solar and our partners. Overall, we're experiencing strong buyer demand for our utility scale systems projects due to our proven systems performance, execution record and attractive financial profile.
Turning to Slide 11. I want to update you on how we see the key markets evolving and how this relates to First Solar's growth strategy and our investments. In Europe, Germany, France and Italy are implementing changes to their feed-in tariff structures, market caps and tender processes. The industry will require a period of adjustment and understanding of the changes, since some of the implementation details have not been finalized. In addition, the Italian government's decision-making process resulted in a market pause and excess channel inventories. Rise in European interest rates are also applying pressure to project economics. These factors create a demand, oversupply and price risks, and highlight the importance of a global market development and project pipelines, which are strengths for First Solar.
Tighter industry economics are expected in the second half of 2011, which we believe are largely reflected in our guidance. Overall, First Solar supports consistent and predictable policies because it is critical to achieving sustainable markets. Reductions in subsidies are necessary to reduce speculation and to drive progress toward affordable solar electricity generation. We look forward to clarification of the policy uncertainties to be more specific. Earlier this year, the German government adopted a partial July and September pull-in of the January 2012 FiT digression. The changes in trends suggest the market of about 4 gigawatt in 2011. There is potential that nuclear energy concerns may influence due to renewable policies and targets, but it's really too soon to assess the impact.
In France, the government revised the FiT program and implemented a 500-megawatt cap on the annual market size and introduced the tender system for large projects. We are disappointed that the new decree does not provide sufficient multi-year visibility and certainty for a sizable French PV market. The government has failed to take into account the needs of investors in existing projects. We're now waiting for details about the tender system before making a decision about the long-term viability of the market, and our French factory remains on indefinite hold. Because of grandfather projects, the French market should exceed the cap in 2011 and range from 500 to 800 megawatt this year. Italy remains unclear with regards to both an extension of the current program, CE 3, and the timing and terms of the new program, CE 4. It is clear, however, that the existing delay in FiT clarity will require a quarter or more to reach our project financing and development. Further delay in FiT details will continue to impact project realization, as well as future project planning and development. We are actively engaging in the FiT policy discussions and monitoring the situation.
As a result of these anticipated changes, we expect the European industry demand to go through a period of adjustment in the second and third quarters. However, a number of our strategies will help us mitigate these risks. First, we continue to adapt our third party module offering to levels we anticipate to drive sell through. We're extending into this 10 to 30 kilowatt European commercial rooftop segment to further diversify our business. This is enabled by our Series 3 technology and will be executed with current and new customers.
As we have in 2010, we plan to use our 2.4 gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. Most of our approximately 450 megawatt North American systems builds are planned for the second half, and we have the flexibility to build additional 150 megawatt of systems if needed. We expect to continue to add new EPC and PPA agreements in North America to increase our pipeline. We continue to diversify geographically and invest in market development in North America, India, Australia, the Middle East and China. We are also continuing to invest to drive for minimum LCOE and maximum energy yield.
In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law to increase the RPS requirements to 33% by 2020 with compliance milestones, which establishes California as the national leader in renewable energy. We believe that California IOUs are on their way to fulfilling their 33% RPS requirements, but the final realization rate is yet to be determined, which we see as an opportunity for First Solar. We are also continuing to encourage policy in those states to support the development of sustainable PV markets, and we are starting to see project opportunity in other states. The DOE loan guarantee program funding was preserved in the 2011 budget negotiations and existing applications were grandfathered. It is unclear if there will be a need to additional appropriations for lending authorities and the coveted credit subsidy fee to fund all of the existing applications. The program is important because it helps establish the capital markets and builds an investor base which we hope will support the ability to place long-term un-guaranteed project bonds into U.S. institutional market.
In China, the government has recently increased its commitment to developing the solar market. As part of the 12 5-year development plan, China has set a goal to install 5 gigawatt of solar by 2015, and is considering increasing this goal to 10 gigawatt on its way to achieving at least 20 gigawatt by 2020. In addition, the government increased its surcharge that the grid company can apply when selling power to the end consumer, which should help fund renewable programs. However, systems providers, including First Solar, need sustainable economics to drive growth and we are hopeful that a transparent and appropriately set national market support structure will be implemented. First Solar is focusing on the execution of the Ordos project, and is actively pursuing several other potential solar project opportunities in China.
We continue to see momentum in India, driven by the National Solar Mission objective of 22 gigawatt by 2020, as well as by robust programs in states like Gujarat. Over 1 gigawatt of PPAs have been assigned, but the high cost of capital and immature margin finance markets are possible constraints to realization. We are increasing investment in India to help the market realize its potential. We are working with a number of customers and our pipeline could result in more than 100 megawatts of projects in 2011. The market is expected to grow to 500 to 600 megawatts in 2012.
In Australia, the federal government's solar flagship program and state FiTs are promoting growing market growth. The preferred bidders for the 400-megawatt first phase of the Solar Flagship's program are expected to be announced in Q2. We are participating in a number of programs with local partners including 2 of the 4 shortlisted PV projects that are in the first phase of the Solar Flagship's program. The Australian market offers emerging segments such as large-scale off-grid PV installations that could replace the high cost existing diesel generation that's there.
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other countries are exploring the introduction of utility scale solar into their energy mix. The Saudi government announced the $100 billion plan to meet rising electricity demand and cut its dependence on oil, which could increase from 3 million barrels per day today to 8 million barrels by 2030. Policy details are expected in the third quarter. Other Gulf countries are also putting in place support mechanisms. For example, UAE recently launched a prequalification procedure for a 100-megawatt project, and Oman is expected to launch a similar process for a 200-megawatt project.
On Slide 12, we highlight the areas we are focusing on to drive predictable long-term growth to make Solar affordable. We have made progress in achieving multi-year visibility through our North American pipeline, contracts in developed markets and by developing new markets. Although individual market performance may vary from time to time, our diversification strategy will enable us to maintain flexibility to respond to these changes.
We are focused on minimizing LCOE, optimizing project returns and enabling the fastest lead time to generation to drive towards grid parity in the markets we serve. This will be accomplished by reducing our proprietary thin film module cost per watt to $0.52 to $0.63 by 2014, and increasing version efficiency to 13 1/2% to 14% by 2014. We are on plan to achieve this and have the lowest module costs in the industry today by 30% to 40%. These improvements, along with continued execution of our balance and systems roadmap, should allow us to drive pricing to grid parity. First Solar's project development pipeline and EPC capability are world class, and we will leverage this to provide complete low-cost application solutions as we develop new business and segments.
Over the next few years, we plan to execute on our 2.4 gigawatt pipeline in North America and expand it further. We expect this pipeline to support our 1 gigawatt of annual builds starting in 2012. This gives visibility to a significant portion of our planned production for the next several years.
We are increasing our investment in new market development and technologies to grow our pipelines. This includes developing new channel partners in the United States, Asia and the Middle East by leveraging our experience and technology. We are developing technology and application solutions tailored to market segments to create favorable economics and drive the transition to affordable solar electricity. Our thin film module technology will evolve to enable us to pursue new market segments with higher efficiencies and electricity yields and with lower costs. Our almost 3 gigawatt of production capacity by the end of 2012 will support this growth.
Finally, we plan to maintain financial discipline and deliver strong predictable returns as we pursue economically sustainable markets. Our goal is to deliver an EVA of 5 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital on our projects, technology and capital investments. Our strong balance sheet will continue to enable our growth and provide a competitive advantage.
Before we discuss Slide 13, I want to take a moment and thank Bruce Sohn for contributing to the development and operational success of First Solar, and to let you know he is leaving operations in the very capable hands of executives like Tymen DeJong who has been running our manufacturing plants for about 15 months. Tymen has 26 years of semiconductor manufacturing experience at Intel and Numonyx and has been working closely with Bruce since joining First Solar.
Slide 13 shows that our end-of-year capacity is now 2.8 gigawatt in 2012. We continue to execute our factory expansion plans which remain on schedule, with the exception of the 2-line French factory which is on indefinite hold and has been removed from our 2012 capacity plant. We are now projecting 44 lines in total by the end of 2012, down from 46 prior.
Note that with both the Vietnam and Mesa facilities, we are implementing a new strategy that involves constructing more building space than required to meet our current capacity plan. For example, the Mesa expansion is a 4-line factory, but the buildings show an infrastructure can accommodate 10 production lines and allow for future growth. With this new strategy, additional lines can be added with shorter lead times.
To summarize, European demand has been impacted by FiT changes and uncertainty, but we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive sell-through of our 2011 production. We continue to invest to develop new markets and will drive solar PV industry growth in the future. We are making progress increasing visibility through our North American pipeline, our partnerships in developed markets and by developing new markets. We're focused on executing our systems pipeline, factory expansion and cost roadmaps, and we remain committed to our mission of driving Solar PV to sustainable economics.
Before we go to the financials, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank James Zhu for serving as our interim CFO over the past few months and enabling a smooth transition to Mark Widmar. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our future quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2011. Mark?"
4593731,130501154,1757523,"First Solar, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 03, 2011",2011-05-03,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the four",1589,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. Looking at Slide 16, during the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in line with our full year guidance. Net sales for the first quarter were $567.3 million, down $42.5 million or 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as we allocated modules to system builds to meet contracted delivery schedules. Revenue recognition is expected for those volumes later in the year. Additionally, we had 7 fewer days in Q1 resulting from our adoption of a calendar fiscal year in the fourth quarter of 2010. ASPs declined slightly due to a full quarter's impact of 2011 prices which we implemented in December of 2010. These impacts were partially offset by the positive effect of increased systems revenue recognition. Our EPC revenue mix increased from 5% of net sales in the fourth quarter to 8% of net sales in the first quarter. The blended exchange rate in the first quarter increased $0.01 sequentially to $1.34 per euro, while the spot rate also increased $0.01 to $1.37 per euro. The stronger euro had a minor impact on net sales as we were heavily hedged in line with our long-term strategy.
We produced 407 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven by the ramp of our FiT factory in Malaysia, KLM 5, which reached full production by the end of the quarter. We also improved our line throughput rate to 64.1 megawatt per year. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of 7 fewer days during the quarter.
Looking at our cost per watt, our module cost per watt in the first quarter was $0.75, flat with the prior quarter. Our core manufacturing costs per watt was also flat at $0.73. The conversion efficiency improvement and material cost savings were offset by the decrease in the number of days and by the increase in the ramp penalty as we ramped KLM 5 and qualified KLM 6.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter gross margin was 45.8%, down 290 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of the mix shift to more systems sales, as well as lower average selling prices, partially offset by the non-repeat of the Q4 module replacement program accrual and the improvements in the conversion efficiencies. Our Module gross margin was 49.7% during the quarter, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Operating expenses were down $0.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower compensation expenses driven in part by the non-repeat of our fourth quarter bonus accrual increase. Information Technology, Travel and other expenses also contributed to this sequential decline. These items are mostly offset by increasing R&D investments.
Looking at Slide 20. Slide 20 shows net sales and operating income churns. Operating income for the first quarter was $129.4 million compared to $165.7 million in the fourth quarter due to the decrease in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 27.2% in the prior quarter. As we progress through the year, our operating margin is levered to the timing of both systems revenue recognition and operating expenses. First quarter net income was $116 million or $1.33 per share on a fully diluted basis. And the effective tax rate was 12.8%.
Looking at cash flows. In the first quarter, operating cash flow was negative $43.8 million and free cash flow was negative $275.5 million. We spent $169 million for capital expenditures and depreciation was $47.1 million. We also funded $63 million to our end-of-life recycling program for which we set aside cash once per year in the first quarter. First quarter cash flow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years, and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, the annual bonus payout and the end-of-life recycling funding. Project assets inventories and deferred revenue grew on more construction in progress in our systems business.
Also, we invested about $50 million more on capital expenditures compared to the first quarter of 2010. Due to the timing of revenue, net revenue recognition for our systems build, we expect to consume cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of 2011. Looking at our balance sheet. Overall, our balance sheet remains strong. During the first quarter, we used $401 million of cash. In addition to the items mentioned earlier, we also paid down our revolving line of credit by $100 million, funded our recycling program as mentioned earlier, paid for our RayTracker acquisition and increased components inventory, including strategic raw material. Net debt -- excuse me, debt decreased by a $106 million and our debt to equity ratio improved to 4%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2011. We made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We increased our spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.35 per euro. For the second quarter, we are fully hedged at a rate of $1.34 per euro. For the full year, about 63% of our net sales and 84% of our expected net income are hedged at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. As of today, a $0.01 change in the dollar-euro spot rate would impact our revenue guidance for the year by about $3 million, and our net income guidance by about $1 million. Our module pricing reflect expected European FiT changes in 2011 and is intended to enable sell-through economics. We plan to build approximately 450-megawatt DC of systems projects in North America, up from 400 megawatts in prior guidance. We retain the flexibility to increase this amount to 600 megawatts should demand in other markets fall short of current expectations. However, that flexibility has declined and will continue to decline as we progress through the year.
We began shipping from Malaysia plant 5 in the first quarter and it ramped to full production by the end of Q1. We are ramping plant 6 in the second quarter, followed by the ramp of our second German factory in the third quarter. Our capital expenditures is primarily driven by capacity expansions in Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam and the U.S.
Page 24 shows that based on these assumptions, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The new factory ramp penalty in cost of goods sold will range from $10 million to $15 million and the factory start-up expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million, $10 million below prior guidance due to the indefinite hold of our French factory. Stock based compensation is expected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold. That is in line with prior guidance.
GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $900 million to $970 million which is slightly below prior guidance. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. We estimate the year-end 2011 fully diluted share count to be in the range of 87 million to 88 million shares. Earnings per fully diluted share to range from $9.25 to $9.75, in line with prior guidance. Capital expenditures for the year is expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Approximately 75% of our capital budget in 2011 is for capacity expansion, and another 15% to 20% is for factory maintenance which includes productivity improvements and R&D investments. The remainder covers infrastructure spending for IT, systems, facilities and others.
Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion. This is slightly below our prior guidance, primarily due to the timing of system-related milestone payments received during the year. Annual return on net assets will be 17% to 18%, in line with our goal to deliver returns exceeding our weighted average cost to capital by 5 percentage points.
Finally, Slide 25 is an update of the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition and operating income dollars through 2011. Please note that as you read across horizontally from Q1 to Q4 in each chart, the sum of all the quarters is 100%. Note that the second quarter, we are expecting to recognize less than 16% of our full year revenue guidance and approximately 9% of our full year operating income guidance. The profile is driven by the following assumptions: First, Agua Caliente revenue recognition starts in the third quarter and accelerates into the fourth quarter. The commencement of revenue recognition for Agua is one quarter later than in prior guidance, impacting the quarterly profile. This is due to the continued delays in the DOE funding. Second, factory capacity is ramping throughout 2011. Third, Canadian projects under completed contract accounting show revenue recognition primarily in the fourth quarter. Fourth, the pattern of operating expenses is lumpy. In particular, during Q2, we expect an increase in research and development associated with process improvements that will have a positive cost-per-watt impact in the mid- to long-term. We also expect an increase in SG&A as we invest in market development and due to one-time severance expense. 
Additionally, start-up expenses spiked to approximately $18 million to $20 million in Q2 before moderating back to Q1 levels in the second half of 2011. Finally, we continue to use our systems pipeline as a buffer against European demand fluctuations, which could affect our balance of systems revenue. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and we open the call for questions. Operator?"

I mean, with a lot of the changes or pending changes that are out there especially Italy, the market started out really slow in 2011, and so there's some build in channel inventory. Due to that build and the uncertainty, there's pressure on average selling prices. So I think prices are moving faster than people expected. So additionally there is -- that's not just that, but it's also the financing costs are rising in Germany and elsewhere that's impacting the project economics overall. So our outlook in terms of a year carries some of that lower ASP assumption, and that's embedded in our guidance, which as Mark described is partially offset by the FX and what we're seeing. And as we've discussed, we're going to look at what we have in our cap at pipeline and now are planning to build 450 megawatt versus the 400 we've talked about before. So I would tell you that the market has been delayed, and as we said, relative to Italy, especially we saw something came out today as we were just joining the conference. We haven't had a chance to review that. But the impact of Italy has created a challenge and a delay that'll take another quarter or 2, I think, to sort out once they tell us what the rules are."

So each of those contracts has some range in it, in terms of what you build when and milestone commitments in terms of total. So that's where we can do part of that upside. In addition, there are unannounced customer projects. So they're customer developed projects where we would provide EPC and module installation in total. And then also, we can -- because of our focus and effort in cycle time, we've increased our ability to put megawatts on the ground. So that also provides the flexibility and opportunity to meet customer demands and drive it that way. So I think that, that's where that range comes from, and what we try to do is moderate it with the external module demand. So we view the external module demand as perishable. So when we want to be able to serve that demand with our customers and ensure that they can develop their applications, and this gives us a buffer to some of these fluctuations that take place. So that's where that comes from. And the second part of your question, can you restate? What's that?"

So I think I mentioned, despite a lot of the big volume ground mount systems that were installing in North America and elsewhere, still 30% of our business is rooftop in total. So it's really -- we've focused on the 30-kilowatt and above, in large part because we've been sold out throughout our history and a lot of our customers have always wanted to pursue that market. And I think it's an opportunity for us to apply some of our know-how and application development and beat [ph] installation rates and other things in that market as well. So we've not focused on it, and I don't anticipate it would have a significant effect on our margins in total."

So I would say that -- a couple of things. One is we see the similar commodity pressures that many people see in the BoS area, so if you think about copper or some steel, things like that, so that kind of commodity pricing, we try to do opportunistic buys and negotiate, but there's definitely some pressure there. So that affects us. Anything that you would read about transportation and costs related to transportation, so surcharges for transportation, whether it's on a sea or over land, that is something that would affect us that we do our best to manage. We have long-term contracts in place for the major commodities that we acquire. So like as you mentioned encapsulants or glass or other things. And you remember we've gone from being basically a very small buyer of glass 5 years ago to one of the top 3 flat glass buyers in the world today, so we've done a lot of good work, I think, there. So there is pressures for sure, but given the fact that a large part of our costs are within our control, in our operational control, and we use so little key raw materials to make the semiconductor, that it is a different scenario, I think, than some of our competitors."

Some of that is driven by the ASP pressure that we were talking about. And again, some of that is more to see higher growth or new emerging growth markets, right? So that we move some volume away from Europe where we're seeing some slowness and we're moving that into other growth markets like India. We are seeing a little bit of an ASP pressure from that standpoint. The only other thing that was significant that was in this round of guidance that we didn't have, we do have some severance-related expense that was not in our prior guidance and to be honest with you, I'd make the majority of the drop of $10 million."
