On this morning's call, I'll first comment on our performance for 2010 both from a financial and operational viewpoint. Victoria will then review the financial performance for 2010, as well as our expectation for 2011 in more detail. Following her comments, I'll discuss our plans for allocating capital in 2011 and ways that we believe will increase the value of our company on a per-share basis. 
First, our 2010 performance. I'm pleased to announce we have achieve our 2010 guidance for all key metrics. We are $0.94 a share of adjusted EPS, which was at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.90 to $0.95. Also our proportional free cash flow up $1.3 billion exceeded guidance by approximately $200 million. I think our results very simply reflect the fact that economic growth in power demand increased in some of the emerging markets in which we operate were stronger than anticipated, particularly in Asia and Latin America. 
Part demand and improved operations in these two markets help to offset the continued erosion of our profitability in North America, primarily driven by continued low gas-based electricity prices and higher coal cost. Our financial results were also driven by strong operational performance, supported by the continued implementation of initiatives across our portfolio, including the global sourcing of solid fuels and freight, long-term service agreements, transformers and other major capital equipment. Our asset management program, which maximizes the efficiency of our capital expenditures also help drive strong performance for the year.
In 2010, we also improved operating cash flows to strong collection rates and increased sales. For example, our Dominican Republic business benefited from new power purchase agreements and a high collection rates due to the receipt of past due government receivables. 
In our Generation business is, our fundamental metric to assess operational performance is the forced outage rate, which captures unplanned outage time at a plant. A lower outage rate is better as the results of higher profitability by increasing the ability to generate kilowatt hours and lowering unplanned maintenance cost. In 2010, our global forests outage rate improved to 4.3% from 7.3% in the prior year and were significantly below our five-year average of 5.9%. Much of the suburban can be traced to the performance turnarounds of the plants we acquired during the past few years, such as our coal-fired plants in the Philippines and Mexico, and this one of our skill sets that give us a unique competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
In our Distribution businesses, a key indicator for operational efficiency is the ability to reduce nontechnical losses or power, which was applied to final users, but was never built due to theft, fraud or billing system issues. As a result of the focus efforts in this area in 2010, nontechnical losses declined to 3.1% from 3.4% in 2009, contributing to an improvement of 15% over the prior five-year average of 3.7%. The significant driver of this performance came from our Brazilian utility, Eletropaulo, through the use of new metering equipment, grew collection rates and customer connection activities. The result of the severance can be seen in the operating cash flow transfer Latin America in 2010.
Turning to the construction side of our portfolio. We brought approximately 800 megawatts on line last year. We currently, have just over 2,000 megawatts capacity under construction, of which 1,800 megawatts is expected to come online by the end of 2011. And over 95% of our current construction capacity is under long-term contract for its output. 
While construction milestones continue to be achieved, including the resumption of coal activity in our company to plot in Chile, this strong performance has been somewhat dampened by continuing delays at our 670 megawatt coal-fired Maritza plant in Bulgaria. 
As you'll recall, we expected Maritza out to be fully commissioned by year-end in 2010. To date, however, we have not achieved commercial operations at Maritza. The going delays in terms of reaching full commercial operations have also resulted in a dispute with our EPC contractor, who was late in delivering the completed plan. Resolution in mitigation of the impacting of this delay are our top management priority for us in 2011.  And once we resolve the legal and technical issues and the plant is fully operational, we should be expected to have $0.105 per share per year on a steady-state basis. 
Beyond Maritza, we also have 1,100 megawatts of capacity projected to come online during 2011, primarily in Latin America and all these projects are progressing well in terms of meeting their schedules. This includes our 500 megawatt Angamos coal plant in Northern Chile, which is location of much of the country's copper mining operations. We've already achieved full of operations on Unit 1 and are progressing rapidly in commissioning of Unit 2.
This puts us on track to meet our targeted finishing the project during the second half of 2011. Additionally, our 220 megawatt Changuinola  hydroelectric project in  Panama  has completed the tunneling  required for the powerhouse and the construction of the dam itself approximately 80% complete. We expect the Changuinola  project to be completed by its guaranteed completion date, which will occur in the second half of 2011.  Also we have 150 megawatts of Wind Generation capacity in the California and PGM markets will be completed by the end of 2011. 
Finally, I'm extremely pleased to confirm that we have cleared all remaining permitting hurdles with respect to our 270 megawatt Campiche coal-fired project in Chile. In January of this year, the Supreme Court of Chile upheld the ruling of the appeals court with regards to the validity of Campiche's construction permits. This action removed the last obstacle and we have resumed coal activity and expect to complete the project in early 2013. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the 2010 financial results and 2011 expectations. Victoria?"

As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash flow",1507,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, out. As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash flow in particular came very strong driven by better-than-expected performance in our Latin American Generation segment and our nonrecurring receivable collection there. 
Our results compared to 2009 also reflects improved trends. Demand in Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Latin America remained strong, while helping to offset continued deterioration of dark spreads in North America. Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers affecting gross margin.
Higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in central Chile and Panama is the key driver of our improved earnings in the fourth quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Chile's volumes improved as demand return to its robust pre levels. As a reminder, immediately after the earthquake last February, volume had declined by 10% from the prior year. Recovery was relatively quick and sustained as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results where demand increased by 1.9% compared to the third quarter of this year, and is up 46.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  Panama  experience record rainfalls this quarter, which enabled higher volume at our businesses. In addition, our recently acquired business in Northern Ireland begun to contribute earnings.
Foreign exchange was not a material driver of earnings growth compared to 2009. Our consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, an increase of $197 million or 24% relative to 2009. This increase is driven mostly by the Latin American volume increases I just described. On a proportional basis, we earned $550 million of gross margin and increase of $86 million or 19% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.56. This was the result of $0.76 impact of long-lived asset impairment losses, primarily related to our Merchant businesses in New York and Texas. These non-cash impairment are the results of the same trends we've been discussing over the past few earnings call: The compression of merchant margins due to lower electricity prices driven by lower natural gas, combined with higher coal and pet coke cost. 
In the fourth quarter, based on recent legislative and regulatory activities, we also refined our outlook relative to the expectations for our New York and Texas generation plant, which required us to write down the full value of those long-lived assets. Excluding the impact of these impairments, adjusted EPS was $0.23, an increase of $0.02 over 2009. This favorability reflects the positive gross margin trends I just discussed, as well as the December renewables of our favorable U.S. income tax loss related to the treatment of cash dividends from certain of our non-US subsidiaries. This renewal lowered our role for yield tax provision as we had originally projected.
Now let's discuss cash flow. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow increased $773 million from last year to $1.1 billion, an increase of $410 million on a proportional basis. It is important to note that the fourth quarter of 2009 included a one-time tax payment of $326 million at one of our businesses in Brazil. Excluding this payment in 2009, our cash flow should have helped the year-over-year growth of $470 million growth on a consolidated basis and $357 million on a proportional basis. This was driven by favorable gross margin and lower working capital requirements in Latin America, which was a result of higher collections in the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil. These events in the Dominican Republic and Brazil are not expected to recur in 2011.
Similarly, consolidated free cash flow increased by $653 million to $785 million for the quarter, driven mostly by the same factors I just discussed. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $324 million to $374 million.
Now turning to our Parent Company Liquidity. Our parents liquidity of $1.8 billion is down $260 million versus the third quarter of 2010, and year-over-year had increased $579 million over December 31, 2009. During the quarter, liquidity benefited by $333 million from a combination of the proceeds from the sale of our Qatar business in October, as well as subsidiary distribution, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. 
We talked last quarter about our capital allocation policy. In the fourth quarter, we continue to operate within this same framework. We redeemed the remaining $294 million of Senior secured second priority notes, and we repurchased $84 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.26. We also renewed our repurchase program at the end of the year to ensure that we could continue to leverage this value drivers through 2011.  Finally, we invested $244 million in various construction and development projects. 
In summary, we exited 2010 with positive momentum based on the initiatives that are continuing into 2011. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for the year ahead.
For the next 12 months, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.8 to $1.14, which represents earnings growth of $0.15 to 21% over 2010 actuals. This growth is driven by several factors: First, earnings from new plants completing construction in 2011, as well as the value loan for acquisition, contribute $0.12 of incremental earnings; second, we had $0.06 of incremental savings from the nearly $1 billion of Parent Company debt that was retired in 2010; third, we have favorable operations driven primarily by the strong demand growth in Latin America.  Partially damping this momentum is the unfavorable movement in tax rate, a higher share count and foreign currency; lastly, we benefited in 2010 by $0.06 from withholding tax reversal at one of our subsidiaries in Chile, which will not recur in 2011.
In addition to comparing our results to 2010, I also want to briefly explain the major drivers of change versus $1.4 to $1.7 we discussed in the third quarter call. Since then, we have removed negative impact of AES  Eastern Energy in New York and adjusted for lower depreciation expense in Deepwater and Texas for a benefit of $0.11. In addition, a change in the 2011 projected effective tax rate yielded a $0.05 improvement. 
Partially offsetting these positive drivers is the construction delay at Maritza and the impact from a loss of earnings from our coal-fired plant in Connecticut, Spain, which reentered organization earlier this year. The year-over-year trend for cash flow guidance requires a bit more explanation, and it does not follow the same trajectory as adjusted EPS. Our 2011 proportional free cash guidance range is $900 million to $1.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million from 2010 level. However, please remember that 2010 actual results included several large nonrecurring items such as the receivable collections in the DR, which boosted cash flow on a one-time basis. Therefore,  perhaps we should look at the trajectory in 2008, a proportion of free cash flow, which is grown by 29%.
Further evidence of continued strong underlying operations is our 2011 subsidiary distribution guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range is higher than 2010 actuals. As you may recall from our prior calls, over the past year, we focused on several key assessments of our support cost, given that we've now moved to much greater stability and rationalization of our corporate systems and platform. These review highlighted some quick kits, as well as a longer-term projects that will require additional automation and process improvements. We've moved out quickly on efficiency initiatives ranging from leveraging share buying power for commodity purchases across the portfolio, generating significant savings on our $2 billion annual spend. 
In addition, similar efforts in hardware and software purchases combined to save us nearly $20 million. Enhanced inventory and plant maintenance management across the merchant also enabled us to save nearly $25 million in 2010. At our time of rising cost of fuel squeezed margins there. Likewise, our increased focus on greater automation, shared service environment and audit reductions in finance and IT saves another $11 million year-over-year.
Also, these efforts permanently lower the AES cost of providing power wherever we operate. Some of these cost savings benefit us directly at the business unit operating level in cost of sales, while other reduced our support cost at corporate and the region in SG&A. In 2011, we will be continuing with these initiatives, and I look forward to sharing our progress on them in the months to follow. 
In summary, operations continue to execute well, and market demand is increasing in select markets, positioning us well to deliver earnings growth in 2011. In addition, our balance sheet remain strong, allowing us to invest in the best available options, ranging from stock repurchase, debt retirement, investments in M& and where Greenfield development. 
With that, let me take turn it back to Paul to provide additional commentary on 2011 in capital allocations. Paul?"

As Victoria just mentioned, we ended the year with liquidity of $1.8 billion, of which just over $1.1 billion was in the form of cash. In terms of allocating that capital, we'll continue to do so in ways which we believe will create the most value per share for our shareholders. 
In 2010, we reduced our debt by approximately $900 million. And since launching our stock buyback program, we've invested $116 million to date by repurchasing 9.7 million shares at an average price of $11.93 per share. Share repurchase remained an important tool to increase shareholder value. We also invested in 1,625 megawatts of generating capacity through acquisitions in addition to the nearly 800 megawatts of capacity that was brought online, these plants completed construction. Nevertheless, our stock price did not move to reflect the value that we think is inherent in our portfolio businesses, and none of us at AES  were satisfied with the performance of our stock in 2010. We're committed to pulling all the levers that we can to return value to shareholders. 
It's worth noting that we have shifted to a more focused approach to making new investments. There are a number of very attractive markets around the globe today, but we will be concentrating our efforts in those markets where we see the greatest long-term value creation potential for AES. We believe that this will also move to reduce some of the complexity in our portfolio, which may also be one of the factors weighing in our stock price. 
As we look forward to 2011, we'll continue to approach allocating capital ways that make the most sense from a shareholder value standpoint. And with some additional portfolio management opportunities that might exist, this would only increase the financial flexibility that we have to allocate the debt and stock buybacks, as well as value to create new investments. I'll now talk about few of the areas that we see the potential for value accretive investments in 2011.
In Southeast Asia, our 1,200 megawatt Greenfield coal-fired plant in Vietnam has achieved significant milestones. Last week, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Tuscan Heavy Industry and Construction, and we execute documentation for the sale of a 49% interest in the project to POSCO power in Korea and China Investment Corporation or CIC in order of 15% of shares of AES. This sale will not only added value strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but also enhances our return on investment and demonstrates a significant value-added during the Greenfield development process. 
In addition to confirming the value that AES  creates for Greenfield development, it represents an excellent example of a template for cooperation on future development opportunities. Strong partners like POSCO  and CIC  are important to AES' growth strategy. In many markets, it's a competitive differentiator that will allow us to earn attractive returns in the face of what can be a very competitive market for new power development and acquisitions. 
In Turkey, another market of interest to us is the upcoming privatization process of fortress of valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline of projects in concert with Coach holding, another key strategic partner for AES. As Turkey  largest conglomerate, Coach Holding represents approximately 7% of the Turkey's GDP. As well respected company owns a broad range of businesses, including various industrial, mining and refinery businesses. Once approved by the authorities in Turkey, this partnership will be anchored by Coach's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which will be transferred to the joint venture, as well as some hydroplants owned by AES . In addition to partnership with diversifying our other energy sources, coal, hydroelectric, wind, as well as natural gas, by pursuing Greenfield projects and acquisitions, including those associated with Turkey's  plan to privatize 50 MW of generation assets. As these efforts in joint venture will benefit from AES' global development and operations experience and from Coach's market strength and local energy sector insight, we see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market. GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% to 5% with the help to meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market, system capacity is projected to increase with its current 46 gigawatt to approximately 59 gigawatts, but a 5% increase per year through 2015.  In addition, the privatization will put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market in two phases. 
It's worth noting the benefits of privatization for AES are twofold. First, we've demonstrated multiple times we have unique skill set in terms of upgrading or turning around the operations of privatized assets. And second, the near-term earnings profile for acquisitions for more attractive than Greenfield investments. 
And In another market of interest to us, India. We made progress in several fronts. We signed a long term PPA for 50% of the output of our 1,300-megawatt OPGC coal-fired expansion project in the state of Maritza. In addition, AES Solar Energy signed a PPA enclosed on debt financing for 5 megawatts solar portable project in the state . And finally, we achieved financial closing and commenced construction on our 39-megawatt wind project in Gujarat. 
Commercial operations of this wind plant is expected in the third quarter. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the immense project potential in India, but also our ability to capitalize on our position in the country to execute across diverse technologies that we have expertise globally.
And finally, I'd like to mention our solar joint venture with Riverstone. AES Solar delivered strong performance in 2010. As of the end of last year, AES Solar invested $323 million into this venture. For 2011, we anticipate that the solar JV will complete construction on 125 megawatts of projects, of which 58 megawatts are already under construction. We also expect the JV will commence construction on an additional 200 megawatts, and its development pipeline has grown rapidly to over 1,000 MW, in span of six countries. We're very pleased with how things are going with this business. 
In conclusion, we start 2011 in a very strong financial to increase the value of the company. We have a strong balance sheet, with adequate liquidity and growing free cash flow. In addition, we have strong strategic partners in key areas of future growth for us. And most of our late, we are committed to delivering near-term returns to our shareholders. We think the value exists in our portfolio of businesses in operation, construction and development, and we intend to convert that value into returns to you. 
I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and we now look forward to any questions that you might have. Chandra, can you please open up the lines?"

Yes, this year, we have a La Nina phenomenon, and this is the seventh strife year in the last 40. So in February 17, the government came out with a decree, which sort of had three elements. First would be to save approximately 500 gigawatts power of water equivalent. So what they're asking is the generators to dispatch, and then there'll be a netting effect from basically using the higher cost generation. It's basically saving that water. The second part of the decree was to have the ability to lower voltage between 5% and 10% as needed and the third will be some sort of consumer savings initiatives. Regarding Gener, we are pretty much contracted. We have the ability to meet the requirement, our contract with what we call the efficient generation. But in addition, we have generation, which are at our older coal plant, which can be used to dispatch above those. So Gener  is well placed for this drought in terms of its contract and in terms of its generation capacity. Regarding the second part of your question, Mara, in terms of the new environment of rules, which have come out, I think what's important first is that the new requirement do not apply to Campiche or Angamos  because they were under construction prior to the new decree coming out. So that's I think important and that will give us an advantage. The decree also differentiates between of course new plants and existing plants, and there is a time period for putting in the new emission reductions equipment that is needed. Sort of a ballpark figure for Gener right now would be around $200 million basically SGDs that would be necessary, for example, on what coal in some of the scrap plans that we have. But all in new plants that we have in place are coming in within the needs for existing plan under construction."

But as I understand it in the concessions, the ex- factors can't be changed. They can only be done cycle-to-cycle versus on a yearly basis. So that would actually be pretty positive news to the distribution companies, it would seem. And the rate of return is what it is, and I guess they made some mistakes by not including effects risks and some of debt cost seem kind of bizarre.

I really don't have additional insight in terms of if they will decide to make any changes there. I think regarding the comments of the FX, the efficiency factor, the X factor, I agree with you. I think an important element -- this is under a lot of debate with Abrasia is just whether you could change the X factor on a yearly cycle, and is would have a significant difference. We think that it should remain on a three-year cycle. And also I agree with your comments regarding the WAC that it's very likely. That in these discussions there will be some allowance made for FX and other risk factors in that WAC. So regarding both, I intend to agree with you view.

And I think the other part of the earnings growth really comes from -- is we've thought about really over the past several months, where we want to focus is I said, there are really lot of unique markets out there. We can't compete in all of them, and we've started to really select the ones we want to put the most effort, and I think what you see over time is we're starting to manage portfolio to take some of those assets, sell them down where there's not a lot more value we can add and markets that might not be strategic and investing that in some markets where we could get returns above our cost of capital. And I think by having a global portfolio like we do, that gives us to go out and do some things without  having to go out and tap the capital markets again for new equity I think that's important. So I think you could see another four to five years of good earnings growth, and that's what we're really trying to work through as we think about the various options we have to invest, to buyback stock, to reduce debt, to swap assets. It could create some interesting opportunities for us combined with the ability to go out and reduce costs in a pretty significant way."

On this morning's call, I'll first comment on our performance for 2010, both from a financial and an operational viewpoint. Victoria will then review the financial performance for 2010, as well as our expectations for 2011 in more detail. Following her comments, I'll discuss our plans for allocating capital in 2011 in ways that we believe will increase the value of the company on a per-share basis. 
First, our 2010 performance. I'm pleased to announce that we have achieved our 2010 guidance for all key metrics. We are $0.94 a share of adjusted EPS, which was at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.90 to $0.95. Also our proportional free cash flow of $1.3 billion exceeded guidance by approximately $200 million. I think our results very simply reflect the fact that economic growth and power demand increased and some of the emerging markets in which we operate were stronger than anticipated, particularly in Asia and Latin America. 
Power demand and improved operations in these two markets helped to offset the continued erosions of our profitability in North America, primarily driven by continued low gas-based electricity prices and high coal cost. Our financial results were also driven by strong operational performance, supported by the continued implementation of initiatives across our portfolio, including the global sourcing of solid fuels and freight, long-term service agreements, transformers and other major capital equipment. Our asset management program, which maximizes the efficiency of our capital expenditures also helped drive the strong performance for the year.
In 2010, we also improved operating cash flows to strong collection rates and increased sales. For example, our Dominican Republic business benefited from new power purchase agreements and a high collection rate due to the receipt of past due government receivables. 
In our Generation businesses, our fundamental metric to assess operational performance is the forced outage rate, which captures unplanned outage time at a plant. A lower outage rate is better as it results in higher profitability by increasing the ability to generate kilowatt hours and lowering unplanned maintenance cost. In 2010, our global forced outage rate improved to 4.3% from 7.3% in the prior year and was significantly below our five-year average of 5.9%. Much of this improvement can be traced to the performance turnarounds of the plants we acquired during the past few years, such as our coal-fired plants in the Philippines and Mexico. And this is one of our skill sets that gives us a unique competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
In our Distribution businesses, a key indicator for operational efficiency is the ability to reduce non-technical losses or power which was supplied to final users but was never billed due to theft, fraud or billing system issues. As a result of the focused efforts in this area in 2010, non-technical losses declined to 3.1% from 3.4% in 2009, contributing to an improvement of 15% over the prior five-year average of 3.7%. The significant driver of this performance came from our Brazilian utility, Eletropaulo, through the use of new metering equipment, improved collection rates and customer connection activities. The results of these efforts can be seen in the operating cash flow trends for Latin America in 2010.
Turning to the construction side of our portfolio. We brought approximately 800 megawatts on-line last year. We currently have just over 2,000 megawatts capacity under construction, of which 1,800 megawatts is expected to come on-line by the end of 2011, and over 95% of our current construction capacity is under long-term contract for its output. While construction milestones continue to be achieved, including the resumption of coal activity in our Campiche plant in Chile, the strong performance has been somewhat dampened by continuing delays at our 670-megawatt coal-fired Maritza plant in Bulgaria. 
As you will recall, we expected Maritza to be fully commissioned by year end 2010. To date, however, we have not achieved commercial operations at Maritza. The ongoing delays in terms of reaching full commercial operations have also resulted in a dispute with our EPC contractor, who was late in delivering the completed plan. Resolution and mitigation of the impacts of this delay are a top management priority for us in 2011. And once we resolve the legal and technical issues and the plant is fully operational, it should be expected to have $0.105 per share per year on a steady-state basis. 
Beyond Maritza, we also have another 1,100 megawatts of capacity projected to come on-line during 2011, primarily in Latin America, and all these projects are progressing well in terms of meeting their schedules. This includes our 500-megawatt Angamos coal plant in Northern Chile, which has location of much of the country's copper mining operations. We've already achieved full load operations on Unit 1 and are progressing rapidly in commissioning of Unit 2. This puts us on track to meet our target of finishing the project during the second half of 2011. Additionally, our 220-megawatt Changuinola  hydroelectric project in Panama has completed the tunneling required for the powerhouse, and the construction of the dam itself is approximately 80% complete. We expect the Changuinola project to be completed by its guaranteed completion date, which will occur in the second half of 2011. Also we have 150 megawatts of Wind Generation capacity in the California and PJM markets will be completed by the end of 2011. 
Finally, I'm extremely pleased to confirm that we have cleared all remaining permitting hurdles with respect to our 270-megawatt Campiche coal-fired project in Chile. In January of this year, the Supreme Court of Chile upheld the ruling of the appeals court with regards to the validity of Campiche's construction permits. This action removed the last obstacle, and we have resumed coal activity and expect to complete the project in early 2013. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the 2010 financial results and 2011 expectations. Victoria?"

As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash",1509,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash flow, in particular, came in very strong, driven by better-than-expected performance in our Latin American Generation segment and a non-recurring receivable collection there. 
Our results, compared to 2009, also reflects improved trend. Demand in Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Latin America remained strong, while helping to offset continued deterioration of dark spreads in North America. Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers affecting gross margin.
Higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in central Chile and Panama, is the key driver of our improved earnings in the fourth quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Chile's volumes improved as demand return to its robust pre-earthquake level. As a reminder, immediately after the earthquake last February, volume had declined by 10% from the prior year. Recovery was relatively quick and sustained as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results where demand increased by 1.9% compared to third quarter of this year, and it's up fully 6.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Panama experienced record rainfalls this quarter, which enabled higher volume at our businesses. In addition, our recently acquired business in Northern Ireland began to contribute earnings.
Foreign exchange was not a material driver of earnings growth compared to 2009. Our consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, an increase of $197 million or 24% relative to 2009. This increase is driven mostly by the Latin American volume increases I just described. On a proportional basis, we earned $550 million of gross margin and increase of $86 million or 19% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.56. This was the result of $0.76 impact of long-lived asset impairment losses, primarily related to our merchant businesses in New York and Texas. These non-cash impairments are the results of the same trends we've been discussing over the past few earnings call, the compression of merchant margins due to low electricity prices, driven by lower natural gas, combined with higher coal and petcoke cost. 
In the fourth quarter, based on recent legislative and regulatory activities, we also refined our outlook relative to the expectations for our New York and Texas generation plant, which required us to write down the full value of those long-lived assets. Excluding the impact of these impairments, adjusted EPS was $0.23, an increase of $0.02 over 2009. This favorability reflects the positive gross margin trends I just discussed, as well as the December renewables of our favorable U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of cash dividends from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. This renewal lowered our full year tax provision as we had originally projected.
Now let's discuss cash flow. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow increased $773 million from last year to $1.1 billion, an increase of $410 million on a proportional basis. It is important to note that the fourth quarter of 2009 included a one-time tax payment of $326 million at one of our businesses in Brazil. Excluding this payment in 2009, our cash flow should have helped the year-over-year growth of $447 million on a consolidated basis and $357 million on a proportional basis. This was driven by favorable gross margin and lower working capital requirements in Latin America, which was the result of higher collections in the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil. These events in the Dominican Republic and Brazil are not expected to recur in 2011.
Similarly, consolidated free cash flow increased by $653 million to $785 million for the quarter, driven mostly by the same factors I just discussed. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $324 million to $374 million.
Now turning to our Parent Company Liquidity. Our Parent liquidity of $1.8 billion is down $260 million versus the third quarter of 2010, and year-over-year has increased $579 million over December 31, 2009. During the quarter, liquidity benefited by $333 million from a combination of the proceeds from the sale of our Qatar business in October, as well as subsidiary distributions, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. 
We talked last quarter about our capital allocation policy. In the fourth quarter we continued to operate within this same framework. We redeemed the remaining $294 million of senior secured second priority notes, and we repurchased $84 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.26. We also renewed our repurchase program at the end of the year to ensure that we can continue to leverage this value driver through 2011. Finally, we invested $244 million in various construction and development projects. 
In summary, we exited 2010 with positive momentum based on initiatives that are continuing into 2011. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for the year ahead.
For the next 12 months, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, which represents earnings growth of 15% to 21% over 2010 actuals. This growth is driven by several factors. First, earnings from new plants completing construction in 2011, as well as the Ballylumford acquisition contribute $0.17 of incremental earnings. Second, we have $0.06 of incremental interest savings from the nearly $1 billion of Parent Company debt that was retired in 2010. Third, we have favorable operations, driven primarily by the strong demand growth in Latin America.  Partially damping this momentum is the unfavorable movement in tax rate, a higher share count and foreign currency. Lastly, we benefited in 2010 by $0.06 from withholding tax reversal at one of our subsidiaries in Chile, which will not recur in 2011.
In addition to comparing our results to 2010, I also want to briefly explain the major drivers of change versus the $1.04 to $1.07 range we discussed on the third quarter call. Since then, we have removed the negative impact of AES Eastern Energy in New York and adjusted for lower depreciation expense at Deepwater in Texas for a benefit of $0.11. In addition, a change in the 2011 projected effective tax rate yielded a $0.05 improvement. 
Partially offsetting this positive driver is the construction delay at Maritza and the impact from a loss of earnings from our coal-fired plant in Connecticut, Thames, which entered reorganization earlier this year. The year-over-year trend for cash flow guidance requires a bit more explanation as it does not follow the same trajectory as adjusted EPS. Our 2011 proportional free cash guidance range is $900 million to $1.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million from 2010 level. However, please remember that 2010 actual results included several large non-recurring items such as the receivable collections in the DR, which boosted cash flow on a one-time basis. Therefore, as perhaps they should look at the trajectory since 2008, a proportion of free cash flow which has grown by 29%.
Further evidence of continued strong underlying operations is our 2011 subsidiary distribution guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range is higher than 2010 actuals. As you may recall from our prior call, over the past year, we focused on several key assessments of our support cost, given that we've now moved to much greater stability and rationalization of our corporate systems and platform. These reviews highlighted some quick kits, as well as a longer-term projects that will require additional automation and process improvement. We've moved out quickly on efficiency initiatives ranging from leveraging share buying power for commodity purchases across the portfolio, generating significant savings on our $2 billion annual spend. 
In addition, similar efforts in hardware and software purchases combined to save us nearly $10 million. Enhanced inventory and plant maintenance management across the merchant flea also enabled us to save nearly $25 million in 2010, at a time when the rising cost of fuel squeezed margins there. Likewise, our increased focus on greater automation, shared service environment and audit reductions in finance and IT saved another $11 million year-over-year.
Also, these efforts permanently lowered the AES cost to providing power wherever we operate. Some of these cost savings benefit us directly at the business unit operating level in the cost of sales, while others reduced our support cost at corporate and the region in SG&A. In 2011, we will be continuing with these initiatives, and I look forward to sharing our progress on them in the months to follow. 
In summary, operations continue to execute well, and market demand is increasing in select markets, positioning us well to deliver earnings growth in 2011. In addition, our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in the best available options, ranging from stock repurchase, debt retirement, investments in M&A or Greenfield development. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul to provide additional commentary on 2011 in capital allocations. Paul?"

As Victoria just mentioned, we ended the year with liquidity of $1.8 billion, of which just over $1.1 billion was in the form of cash. In terms of allocating that capital, we'll continue to do some ways that we believe will create the most value per share for our shareholders. 
In 2010, we reduced our debt by approximately $900 million. And since launching our stock buyback program, we've invested $116 million to date by repurchasing 9.7 million shares at an average price of $11.93 per share. Share purchases will remain an important tool to increase shareholder value. We also invested in 1,625 megawatts of generating capacity through acquisitions in addition to the nearly 800 megawatts of capacity that was brought on-line as plants completed construction. Nevertheless, our stock price did not move to reflect the value that we think is inherent in our portfolio businesses, and none of us at AES were satisfied with the performance of our stock in 2010. We're committed to pulling all the levers that we can to return value to shareholders. 
It's worth noting that we have shifted to a more focused approach to making new investments. There are a number of very attractive markets around the globe today, but we will be concentrating our efforts in those markets where we see the greatest long-term value creation potential for AES. We believe that this will also move to reduce some of the complexity in our portfolio, which may also be one of the factors weighing on our stock price. 
As we look forward to 2011, we'll continue to approach allocating capital in ways that make the most sense from a shareholder value standpoint. But with some additional portfolio management opportunities that might exist, this would only increase the financial flexibility that we have to allocate the debt and stock buybacks, as well as value-accretive new investments. I'll now talk about a few of the areas where we see the potential for value-accretive investments in 2011.
In Southeast Asia, our 1,200-megawatt Greenfield coal plant in Vietnam has achieved significant milestones. Last week, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction, and we executed documentation for the sale of a 49% interest in the project to POSCO Power in Korea and China Investment Corporation or CIC in order of 15% of the shares of AES. This sale will not only add value to strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but also enhances our return on investment and demonstrates a significant value added during the Greenfield development process. 
In addition to confirming the value that AES  creates to Greenfield development, it represents an excellent example of a template for cooperation on future development opportunities. Strong partners like POSCO and CIC are important to AES' growth strategy. In many markets, it's a competitive differentiator that will allow us to earn attractive returns in the face of what can be a very competitive market for new power development and acquisitions. 
In Turkey, another market of interest to us, the upcoming privatization process affords us a valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline of projects in concert with Koc Holding, another key strategic partner for AES. As Turkey's largest conglomerate, Koc Holding represents approximately 7% of the Turkey's GDP. This well-respected company owns a broad range of businesses, including various industrial, mining and refinery businesses. Once approved by the authorities in Turkey, this partnership will be anchored by Koc's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which will be transferred to the joint venture, as well as some hydro plants owned by AES. In addition to partnership, we'll diversify its other energy sources, coal, hydroelectric, wind, as well as natural gas, by pursuing Greenfield projects and acquisitions, including those associated with Turkey's plan to privatize 15 gigawatts of generation assets. In these efforts, the joint venture will benefit from AES' global development and operations experience. And from Koc's market strength and local energy sector insight, we see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market. GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% to 5% and to help to meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market. System capacity is projected to increase its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, about a 5% increase per year through 2015. In addition, the privatization will put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market in two phases. 
It's worth noting the benefits of privatizations for AES are twofold. First, we've demonstrated multiple times that we have unique skill set in terms of upgrading or turning around the operations of privatized assets. And second, the near-term earnings profile for acquisitions are more attractive than Greenfield investments. 
And in another market of interest to us, India, we've made progress in several fronts. We signed a long-term PPA for 50% of the output of our 1,300-megawatt OPGC coal-fired expansion project in the state of Orissa. In addition, AES Solar signed a PPA and closed on debt financing for our 5-megawatt solar photovoltaic project in the state of Rajasthan. And finally, we achieved financial closing and commenced construction on our 39-megawatt wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations of this wind plant is expected in the third quarter. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the immense market potential in India, but also our ability to capitalize on our position in the country to execute across diverse technologies we have expertise globally.
And finally, I'd like to mention our solar joint venture with Riverstone. AES Solar delivered a strong performance in 2010. As of the end of last year, AES had invested $323 million into this venture. For 2011, we anticipate that the solar JV will complete construction on 125 megawatts of projects, of which 58 megawatts are already under construction. We also expect the JV will commence construction on an additional 200 megawatts. And its development pipeline has grown rapidly to over 1,000 megawatts in span of six countries. We're very pleased with how things are going with this business. 
In conclusion, we start 2011 in a very strong financial to increase the value of the company. We have a strong balance sheet, with adequate liquidity in growing free cash flow. In addition, we have strong strategic partners in key areas of future growth for us. And most importantly, we are committed to delivering near-term returns to our shareholders. We think the value exists in our portfolio of businesses in operation, construction and development, and we intend to convert that value into returns to you. 
I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today, and we now look forward to any questions that you might have. Chandra, could you please open up the lines?"

The EPC contract on December of last year issued a notice of dispute, alleging the lignite that had been supplied for commissioning without a specification. And therefore entitled to an extension of time to complete the power plant and an increase in the contract price and other relief. In January of this year, the EPC contractor advised Maritza that has stopped commissioning on the power plant's two units and initiated arbitration of this alleged lignite claims. Now Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specifications and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counter claims for the delay of liquidated damages and other relief related to the contractor's failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. In terms of the power plant itself today, we expect to start selling energy at 2/3 capacity, about 420 megawatts during the second quarter. This, of course, will depend on discussions that we have with the lenders, with NEK, and with the EPC contractor. And we expect to reach the full load of 600 net megawatts by the end of the year."

But in addition, we have generation, which are at our older coal plant, which can be used to dispatch above this. So Gener is well placed for this drought, in terms of its contract and in terms of its generation capacity. Regarding the second part of your question, Maura, in terms of the new environmental rules which have come out, I think, what's important is first is that the new requirement do not apply to Campiche or Angamos  because they were under construction prior to the new decree coming out. So that's I think important, and that will give us an advantage. The decree also differentiates between, of course, new plants and existing plants. And there is a time period for putting in the new emission reductions equipment that is needed. Sort of a ballpark figure for Gener right now would be around $200 million basically SGDs that would be necessary, for example, on Guacolda, some of the unscrapped plants that we have. But all the new plants that we have in place are coming in within the midst for existing plants under construction."

As I understand it, some of the Board members of BNDS maybe changed out next month. And then potentially, even by this summer, given all the checks that BNDS has written to for other areas and other projects, the potential sale may actually occur, but that's just me pontificating. I have no idea. So maybe if you have any comments on that? And the second question is vis-a-vis the review for Eletropaulo that Brian was asking about in terms of the third cycle, I guess the thing that bothered me about what came out in September was the chance that on a volume and efficiency basis, that would be taken away each year in the first time methodology. But as I understand it, in the concessions, the x factors can't be changed. They can only be done cycle-to-cycle versus on a yearly basis. So that would actually be pretty positive news to the distribution companies, it would seem. And the rate of return is what it is, and I guess they made some mistakes by not including FX risks and some of the debt cost seems kind of bizarre. So that there's a chance that the 7.15 goes up 7.5 to 8, or whatever. But I was just wondering if any specific on the x factor and that the chance of that gets drawn out?"

And, for example, we cleared the SEB debt default last year, and so we're in good standing with them. So again, I think this is institutional as I expect to continue its current policies. I really don't have additional insight in terms of if they would decide to make any changes there. I think regarding the comments of the FX, the efficiency factor, the x factor, I agree with you. I think an important element here -- this is under a lot of debate with ABRADEE, is whether you could change the x factor into a yearly cycle, and this would have a significant difference. We think that it should remain on a three-year cycle. And also I agree with your comments regarding the WAC, that it's very likely that in these discussions they will speed some allowance made for FX and other risk factors in that WAC. So regarding both, I tend to agree with your view. But of course, this will depend on the discussions between ABRADEE and the public hearing and ANEEL.

That's the big driver. We're going to see some earnings growth there. I think that the next piece is when we talk a bit about answering all these questions about the cost, we see some room to continue move the cost down in a corporate basis. It's run up quite a bit, which we have to do to put the systems in place, but we can become a lot more efficient there. Because that provides another couple of years worth of growth on that front. And then I think we've got $1.1 billion of cash sitting around doing very little, which we want to deploy, and that's got value if you deploy that, let's say, you take that and get a 12% return on your earnings, sort of like $132 million, that's over $0.10 a share of earnings if you deploy for stock buybacks depending on price of which you buy back. They could also be accretive. So you've also got that element to it, and we have liquidity beyond that. And I think the other part of the earnings growth really comes from is we've thought about really over the past several months, where we want to focus is I said, there are really lot of unique markets out there. We can't compete in all of them. And we've started to really select the ones we want to put the most effort, and I think what you see over time is we're starting to manage portfolio to take some of those assets, sell them down where there's not a whole lot more value we can add and markets that might not be strategic and investing that in some markets where we could get returns above our cost of capital. And I think by having a global portfolio like we do, that gives us to go out and do some things without having to go out and tap the capital markets again for new equity, and I think that's important. So I think you could see another four to five years of good earnings growth, and that's what we're really trying to work through as we think about the various options we have to invest, to buy back stock, to reduce debt, to swap assets. It could create some interesting opportunities for us combined with the ability to go out and reduce costs in a pretty significant way."

And good morning to all of you joining us today. On this morning's call, I'll first comment on our performance for 2010, both from a financial and an operational viewpoint. Victoria will then review the financial performance for 2010,",992,"Okay. Thanks, Ahmed. And good morning to all of you joining us today. On this morning's call, I'll first comment on our performance for 2010, both from a financial and an operational viewpoint. Victoria will then review the financial performance for 2010, as well as our expectations for 2011 in more detail. Following her comments, I'll discuss our plans for allocating capital in 2011 in ways that we believe will increase the value of the company on a per-share basis. 
First, our 2010 performance. I'm pleased to announce that we have achieved our 2010 guidance for all key metrics. We are at $0.94 a share of adjusted EPS, which was at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.90 to $0.95. Also our proportional free cash flow of $1.3 billion exceeded guidance by approximately $200 million. I think our results very simply reflect the fact that economic growth and power demand increases in some of the emerging markets in which we operate were stronger than anticipated, particularly in Asia and Latin America. 
Power demand and improved operations in these two markets helped to offset the continued erosion of our profitability in North America, primarily driven by continued low gas-based electricity prices and high coal cost. Our financial results were also driven by strong operational performance, supported by the continued implementation of initiatives across our portfolio, including the global sourcing of solid fuels and freight, long-term service agreements, transformers and other major capital equipment. Our asset management program, which maximizes the efficiency of our capital expenditures also helped drive the strong performance for the year.
In 2010, we also improved operating cash flows through strong collection rates and increased sales. For example, our Dominican Republic business benefited from new power purchase agreements and a high collection rate due to the receipt of past due government receivables. 
In our Generation businesses, our fundamental metric to assess operational performance is the forced outage rate, which captures unplanned outage time at a plant. A lower outage rate is better as it results in higher profitability by increasing the ability to generate kilowatt hours and lowering unplanned maintenance cost. In 2010, our global forced outage rate improved to 4.3% from 7.3% in the prior year and was significantly below our five-year average of 5.9%. Much of this improvement can be traced to the performance turnarounds of the plants we acquired during the past few years, such as our coal-fired plants in the Philippines and Mexico. And this is one of our skill sets that gives us a unique competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
In our Distribution businesses, a key indicator for operational efficiency is the ability to reduce non-technical losses or power which was supplied to final users but was never billed due to theft, fraud or billing system issues. As a result of the focused efforts in this area in 2010, non-technical losses declined to 3.1% from 3.4% in 2009, contributing to an improvement of 15% over the prior five-year average of 3.7%. The significant driver of this performance came from our Brazilian utility, Eletropaulo, through the use of new metering equipment, improved collection rates and customer connection activities. The results of these efforts can be seen in the operating cash flow trends for Latin America in 2010.
Turning to the construction side of our portfolio. We brought approximately 800 megawatts on-line last year. We currently have just over 2,000 megawatts capacity under construction, of which 1,800 megawatts is expected to come on-line by the end of 2011, and over 95% of our current construction capacity is under long-term contract for its output. While construction milestones continue to be achieved, including the resumption of full activity in our Campiche plant in Chile, the strong performance has been somewhat dampened by continuing delays at our 670-megawatt coal-fired Maritza plant in Bulgaria. 
As you will recall, we expected Maritza to be fully commissioned by year-end 2010. To date, however, we have not achieved commercial operations at Maritza. The ongoing delays in terms of reaching full commercial operations have also resulted in a dispute with our EPC contractor, who was late in delivering the completed plant. Resolution and mitigation of the impacts of this delay are a top management priority for us in 2011. And once we resolve the legal and technical issues and the plant is fully operational, it should be expected to have $0.105 per share per year on a steady-state basis. 
Beyond Maritza, we also have another 1,100 megawatts of capacity projected to come on-line during 2011, primarily in Latin America, and all these projects are progressing well in terms of meeting their schedules. This includes our 500-megawatt Angamos coal plant in Northern Chile, which is the location of much of the country's copper mining operations. We've already achieved full load operations on Unit 1 and are progressing rapidly in commissioning of Unit 2. This puts us on track to meet our target of finishing the project during the second half of 2011. Additionally, our 220-megawatt Changuinola  hydroelectric project in Panama has completed the tunneling required for the powerhouse, and the construction of the dam itself is approximately 80% complete. We expect the Changuinola project to be completed by its guaranteed completion date, which will occur in the second half of 2011. Also we have 150 megawatts of Wind Generation capacity in the California and PJM markets that will be completed by the end of 2011. 
Finally, I'm extremely pleased to confirm that we have cleared all remaining permitting hurdles with respect to our 270-megawatt Campiche coal-fired project in Chile. In January of this year, the Supreme Court of Chile upheld the ruling of the appeals court with regards to the validity of Campiche's construction permits. This action removed the last obstacle, and we have resumed full activity and expect to complete the project in early 2013. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the 2010 financial results and 2011 expectations. Victoria?"

As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash",1508,"Thanks, Paul. And good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, we delivered on all aspects of our 2010 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were slightly above our expectations, including full year results at or above the high of most guidance metrics. Cash flow, in particular, came in very strong, driven by better-than-expected performance in our Latin American Generation segment and a non-recurring receivable collection there. 
Our results, compared to 2009, also reflects improved trends. Demand in Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Latin America remained strong, while helping to offset continued deterioration of dark spreads in North America. Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers affecting gross margin.
Higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in central Chile and Panama, is the key driver of our improved earnings in the fourth quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Chile's volumes improved as demand returned to its robust pre-earthquake level. As a reminder, immediately after the earthquake last February, volume had declined by 10% from the prior year. Recovery was relatively quick and sustained as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results where demand increased by 1.9% compared to third quarter of this year, and is up fully 6.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Panama experienced record rainfalls this quarter, which enabled higher volume at our businesses there. In addition, our recently acquired business in Northern Ireland began to contribute earnings.
Foreign exchange was not a material driver of earnings growth compared to 2009. Our consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, an increase of $197 million or 24% relative to 2009. This increase is driven mostly by the Latin American volume increases I just described. On a proportional basis, we earned $550 million of gross margin an increase of $86 million or 19% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.56. This was the result of $0.76 impact of long-lived asset impairment losses, primarily related to our merchant businesses in New York and Texas. These non-cash impairments are the results of the same trends we've been discussing over the past few earnings call, the compression of merchant margins due to low electricity prices, driven by low natural gas, combined with higher coal and petcoke costs. 
In the fourth quarter, based on recent legislative and regulatory activities, we also refined our outlook relative to the expectations for our New York and Texas generation plants, which required us to write down the full value of those long-lived assets. Excluding the impact of these impairments, adjusted EPS was $0.23, an increase of $0.02 over 2009. This favorability reflects the positive gross margin trends I just discussed, as well as the December renewal of a favorable U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of cash dividends from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. This renewal lowered our full year tax provision as we had originally projected.
Now let's discuss cash flow. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow increased $773 million from last year to $1.1 billion, an increase of $410 million on a proportional basis. It is important to note that the fourth quarter of 2009 included a one-time tax payment of $326 million at one of our businesses in Brazil. Excluding this payment in 2009, our cash flow showed healthy year-over-year growth of $447 million on a consolidated basis and $357 million on a proportional basis. This was driven by favorable gross margin and lower working capital requirements in Latin America, which was the result of higher collections in the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil. These events in the Dominican Republic and Brazil are not expected to recur in 2011.
Similarly, consolidated free cash flow increased by $653 million to $785 million for the quarter, driven mostly by the same factors I just discussed. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $324 million to $374 million.
Now turning to our Parent Company Liquidity. Our Parent liquidity of $1.8 billion is down $260 million versus the third quarter of 2010, and year-over-year has increased $579 million over December 31, 2009. During the quarter, liquidity benefited by $333 million from a combination of the proceeds from the sale of our Qatar business in October, as well as subsidiary distributions, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. 
We talked last quarter about our capital allocation policy. In the fourth quarter we continued to operate within this same framework. We redeemed the remaining $294 million of senior secured second priority notes, and we repurchased $84 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.26. We also renewed our repurchase program at the end of the year to ensure that we can continue to leverage this value driver through 2011. Finally, we invested $244 million in various construction and development projects. 
In summary, we exited 2010 with positive momentum based on the initiatives that are continuing into 2011. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for the year ahead.
For the next 12 months, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, which represents earnings growth of 15% to 21% over 2010 actuals. This growth is driven by several factors. First, earnings from new plants completing construction in 2011, as well as the Ballylumford acquisition contribute $0.17 of incremental earnings. Second, we have $0.06 of incremental interest savings from the nearly $1 billion of Parent Company debt that was retired in 2010. Third, we have favorable operations, driven primarily by the strong demand growth in Latin America.  Partially damping this momentum is the unfavorable movement in tax rate, a higher share count and foreign currency. Lastly, we benefited in 2010 by $0.06 from withholding tax reversal at one of our subsidiaries in Chile, which will not recur in 2011.
In addition to comparing our results to 2010, I also want to briefly explain the major drivers of change versus the $1.04 to $1.07 range we discussed on the third quarter call. Since then, we have removed the negative impact of AES Eastern Energy in New York and adjusted for lower depreciation expense at Deepwater in Texas for a benefit of $0.11. In addition, a change in the 2011 projected effective tax rate yielded a $0.05 improvement. 
Partially offsetting these positive drivers is the construction delay at Maritza and the impact from a loss of earnings from our coal-fired plant in Connecticut, Thames, which entered reorganization earlier this year. The year-over-year trend for cash flow guidance requires a bit more explanation as it does not follow the same trajectory as adjusted EPS. Our 2011 proportional free cash guidance range is $900 million to $1.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million from 2010 levels. However, please remember that 2010 actual results included several large non-recurring items such as the receivable collections in the DR, which boosted cash flow on a one-time basis. Therefore, it’s perhaps fair to look at the trajectory since 2008, a proportion of free cash flow which has grown by 29%.
Further evidence of continued strong underlying operations is our 2011 subsidiary distribution guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range is higher than 2010 actuals. As you may recall from our prior calls, over the past year, we focused on several key assessments of our support costs, given that we've now moved to much greater stability and rationalization of our corporate systems and platforms. These reviews highlighted some quick hits, as well as some longer-term projects that will require additional automation and process improvements. We've moved out quickly on efficiency initiatives ranging from leveraging share buying power for commodity purchases across the portfolio, generating significant savings on our $2 billion annual spend. 
In addition, similar efforts in hardware and software purchases combined to save us nearly $10 million. Enhanced inventory and plant maintenance management across the merchant flea also enabled us to save nearly $25 million in 2010, at a time when the rising cost of fuel squeezed margins there. Likewise, our increased focus on greater automation, shared-service environments and audit reductions in finance and IT saved another $11 million year-over-year.
Also, these efforts permanently lowered the AES cost of providing power wherever we operate. Some of these cost savings benefit us directly at the business unit operating level in the cost of sales, while others reduce our support costs at corporate and the regions in SG&A. In 2011, we will be continuing with these initiatives, and I look forward to sharing our progress on them in the months to follow. 
In summary, operations continue to execute well, and market demand is increasing in select markets, positioning us well to deliver earnings growth in 2011. In addition, our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in the best available options, ranging from stock repurchase, debt retirement, investments in M&A or Greenfield development. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul to provide additional commentary on 2011 and capital allocations. Paul?"

As Victoria just mentioned, we ended the year with liquidity of $1.8 billion, of which just over $1.1 billion was in the form of cash. In terms of allocating that capital, we'll continue to do so in ways that we believe will create the most value per share for our shareholders. 
In 2010, we reduced our debt by approximately $900 million. And since launching our stock buyback program, we've invested $116 million to date by repurchasing 9.7 million shares at an average price of $11.93 per share. Share purchases will remain an important tool to increase shareholder value. We also invested in 1,625 megawatts of generating capacity through acquisitions in addition to the nearly 800 megawatts of capacity that was brought on-line as plants completed construction. Nevertheless, our stock price did not move to reflect the value that we think is inherent in our portfolio businesses, and none of us at AES are satisfied with the performance of our stock in 2010. We're committed to pulling all the levers that we can to return value to shareholders. 
It's worth noting that we have shifted to a more focused approach to making new investments. There are a number of very attractive markets around the globe today, but we will be concentrating our efforts in those markets where we see the greatest long-term value creation potential for AES. We believe that this will also move to reduce some of the complexity in our portfolio, which may also be one of the factors weighing on our stock price. 
As we look forward to 2011, we'll continue to approach allocating capital in ways that make the most sense from a shareholder value standpoint. But with some additional portfolio management opportunities that might exist, these would only increase the financial flexibility that we have to allocate to debt and stock buybacks, as well as value-accretive new investments. I'll now talk about a few of the areas where we see the potential for value-accretive investments in 2011.
In Southeast Asia, our 1,200-megawatt Greenfield coal plant in Vietnam has achieved significant milestones. Last week, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction, and we executed documentation for the sale of a 49% interest in the project to POSCO Power in Korea and China Investment Corporation or CIC [ph] of 15% of the shares of AES. This sale will not only added value to strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but also enhances our return on investment and demonstrates a significant value added during the Greenfield development process. 
In addition to confirming the value that AES creates to Greenfield development, it represents an excellent example of, and a template for, cooperation on future development opportunities. Strong partners like POSCO and CIC are important to AES' growth strategy. In many markets, it's a competitive differentiator that will allow us to earn attractive returns in the face of what can be a very competitive market for new power development and acquisitions. 
In Turkey, another market of interest to us, the upcoming privatization process affords us a valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline of projects in concert with Koc Holding, another key strategic partner for AES. As Turkey's largest conglomerate, Koc Holding represents approximately 7% of the Turkey's GDP. This well-respected company owns a broad range of businesses, including various industrial, mining and refinery businesses. Once approved by the authorities in Turkey, this partnership will be anchored by Koc's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which will be transferred to the joint venture, as well as some hydro plants owned by AES. In addition to partnership, we'll diversify its other energy sources, coal, hydroelectric, wind, as well as natural gas, by pursuing Greenfield projects and acquisitions, including those associated with Turkey's plan to privatize 15 gigawatts of generation assets. In these efforts, the joint venture will benefit from AES' global development and operations experience. And from Koc's market strength and local energy sector insight, we see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market. GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% to 5% and to help to meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market. System capacity is projected to increase its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, about a 5% increase per year through 2015. In addition, the privatization will put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market in two phases. 
It's worth noting the benefits of privatizations for AES are twofold. First, we've demonstrated multiple times that we have unique skill set in terms of upgrading or turning around the operations of privatized assets. And second, the near-term earnings profile for acquisitions are more attractive than Greenfield investments. 
And in another market of interest to us, India, we've made progress in several fronts. We signed a long-term PPA for 50% of the output of our 1,300-megawatt OPGC coal-fired expansion project in the state of Orissa. In addition, AES Solar signed a PPA and closed on debt financing for our 5-megawatt solar photovoltaic project in the state of Rajasthan. And finally, we achieved financial closing and commenced construction on our 39-megawatt wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations of this wind plant is expected in the third quarter. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the immense market potential in India, but also our ability to capitalize on our position in the country to execute across diverse technologies we have expertise globally.
And finally, I'd like to mention our solar joint venture with Riverstone. AES Solar delivered a strong performance in 2010. As of the end of last year, AES had invested $323 million into this venture. For 2011, we anticipate that the solar JV will complete construction on 125 megawatts of projects, of which 58 megawatts are already under construction. We also expect the JV will commence construction on an additional 200 megawatts. And its development pipeline has grown rapidly to over 1,000 megawatts and spanned six countries. We're very pleased with how things are going with this business. 
In conclusion, we start 2011 in a very strong position to increase the value of the company. We have a strong balance sheet, with adequate liquidity, and growing free cash flow. In addition, we have strong strategic partners in key areas of future growth for us. And most importantly, we are committed to delivering near-term returns to our shareholders. We think the value exists in our portfolio of businesses in operation, construction and development, and we intend to convert that value into returns to you. 
I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. And we now look forward to any questions that you might have. Chandra, could you please open up the lines?"

I think the other part of it is that it's also -- we've seen some cases a good market for portfolio management for selling assets. And that might give us some additional capital that we think we could deploy if we have good investments to trade into, or the stock price remains at the levels it is, it would be another attractive way to use that capital."

Yes, this year, we have a La Nina phenomenon, and it's the seventh driest year in the last 40. So on February 17, the government came out with a decree, which sort of had three elements. First would be to save approximately 500 gigawatts hours of water equivalent. So what they're asking is the generators to dispatch, and then there'll be a netting effect from basically using a higher cost generation, specifically saving that water. The second part of the decree was to have the ability to lower voltage between 5% and 10% as needed. And the third will be some sort of consumer saving initiatives. Regarding Gener, we are pretty much contracted. We have the ability to meet the requirement -- our contract with what we call the efficient generation. But in addition, we have generation, which are at our older coal plant, which can be used to dispatch above this. So Gener is well placed for this drought, in terms of its contract and in terms of its generation capacity. Regarding the second part of your question, Maura, in terms of the new environmental rules which have come out, I think, what's important is first is that the new requirements do not apply to Campiche or Angamos  because they were under construction prior to the new decree coming out. So that's I think important, and that will give us an advantage. The decree also differentiates between, of course, new plants and existing plants. And there is a time period for putting in the new emission reductions equipment that is needed. Sort of a ballpark figure for Gener right now would be around $200 million basically SGDs that would be necessary, for example, on Guacolda, and some of the unscrubbed plants that we have. But all the new plants that we have in place are coming in within the midst for existing plants under construction."

the review for Eletropaulo that Brian was asking about in terms of the third cycle, I guess the thing that bothered me about what came out in September was the chance that on a volume and efficiency basis, that would be taken away each year in the first time methodology. But as I understand it, in the concessions, the x factors can't be changed. They can only be done cycle-to-cycle versus on a yearly basis. So that would actually be pretty positive news to the distribution companies, it would seem. And the rate of return is what it is, and I guess they made some mistakes by not including FX risks and some of the debt cost seems kind of bizarre. So that there's a chance that the 7.15 goes up 7.5 to 8, or whatever. But I was just wondering if any specific on the x factor and that the chance of that gets thrown out?"

And, for example, we cleared the SEB debt default last year, and so we're in good standing with them. So again, I think this is institutional as I expect to continue its current policies. I really don't have additional insight in terms of if they would decide to make any changes there. I think regarding the comments of the FX, the efficiency factor, the x factor, I agree with you. I think an important element here -- this is under a lot of debate with ABRADEE, is whether you could change the x factor into a yearly cycle, and this would have a significant difference. We think that it should remain on a three-year cycle. And also I agree with your comments regarding the WAC, that it's very likely that in these discussions there must be some allowance made for FX and other risk factors in that WAC. So regarding both, I tend to agree with your view. But of course, this will depend on the discussions between ABRADEE and the public hearing and ANEEL. And we will know in the following month.

That's the big driver. We're going to see some earnings growth there. I think that the next piece is when we talk a bit about answering all these questions about the costs, we see some room to continue move the costs down on a corporate basis. It's run up quite a bit, which we had to do to put the systems in place, but we can become a lot more efficient there. So that provides another couple of year’s worth of growth on that front. And then I think we've got $1.1 billion of cash sitting around doing very little, which we want to deploy, and that's got value if you deploy that, let's say, you take that and get a 12% return on your earnings, sort of like $132 million, that's over $0.10 a share of earnings if you deploy for stock buybacks depending on price of which you buy back. They could also be accretive. So you've also got that element to it, and we have liquidity beyond that. And I think the other part of the earnings growth really comes from is we've thought about really over the past several months, where we want to focus is I said, there are really lot of unique markets out there. We can't compete in all of them. And we've started to really select the ones we want to put the most effort, and I think what you see over time is we're starting to manage the portfolio to take some of those assets, sell them down where there's not a whole lot more value we can add in markets that might not be strategic and investing that in some markets where we could get returns that are above our cost of capital. And I think by having a global portfolio like we do, that gives us the ability to go out and do some more things without having to go out and tap the capital markets again for new equity, and I think that's important. So I think you could see another four to five years of good earnings growth, and that's what we're really trying to work through as we think about the various options we have to invest, to buy back stock, to reduce debt, to swap assets. It could create some interesting opportunities for us combined with the ability to go out and reduce costs in a pretty significant way."

Good morning to all of you joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the first quarter of 2011 and also recap key highlights of our recent announcement regarding our acquisition of DPL. After Victoria reviews",550,"Thanks, Joel. Good morning to all of you joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the first quarter of 2011 and also recap key highlights of our recent announcement regarding our acquisition of DPL. After Victoria reviews the first quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on our project center construction, as well as progress on the advanced development pipeline beyond DPL.
The results for the first quarter of 2011 were in line with our expectations. We're in $0.22 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $159 million. These results were driven by the demand growth in Latin America, which helped to offset some of the negative variances that we had anticipated. There are 2 material ones which I would like to highlight one was our Generation business in the Philippines, where volumes declined due to the market returning to a more normal environment with more capacity being available to the market. As you may recall, we benefited significantly last year by having our plant available when many of our competitors were suffering from outages. 2010 was an exceptional year in that regard.
Another factor related to 1 of our Northern Ireland plants, Kilroot, where the PPA was terminated in late 2010 in accordance with its terms. So we saw lower prices as a result of the plant selling on a merchant basis. And neither of these results was unexpected. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, as you can see on Page 19 of the investor presentation, both earnings and cash projections will increase throughout the year as our 1,700 megawatts of construction projects, come online during the latter part of the year. So we are on track and continue to expect the strong balance of the year and to achieve all of our 2011 guidance metrics.
Also as we discussed a few weeks ago, on April 20, we signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of DPL Inc., a public holding company of Dayton Power & Light. Assuming it closing by year-end, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings by $0.05 to $0.07 per share in 2012, excluding acquisition costs. This acquisition will be funded by a combination of new debt and cash-on-hand.
As we also discussed during our prior call, we have strategically focused in key geographies where we have both a competitive advantage, as well as adequate opportunities to achieve attractive returns. We've chosen these markets, 1 of which is the U.S. based on a combination of attractive fundamentals and AES skill sets. This acquisition is in alignment with our refined approach to new investments, which focuses on a smaller number of select markets that we believe will offer the greatest potential for long-term value creation. The acquisition of DPL presents us with opportunities to complement our existing utility platform in the Midwest and IPL and to leverage the skill of our North American footprint. It also allows us to utilize our U.S. tax position efficiently. That combination has allowed us to structure a transaction that provides immediate benefits to both the AES and to the DPL shareholders.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Victoria?"
35312,131523501,124520,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in-line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a stron",1039,"Thanks, Paul and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in-line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a strong rest-of-year, driven primarily by new construction coming online in Chile, Panama and Bulgaria, which together with contribute approximately $0.06 to $0.08 of adjusted EPS by year-end. This includes $0.02 from Maritza  with stage commissioning over the rest of this year. Although adjusted earnings and cash flow during the first quarter of 2011 are lower than during the same period last year, this is a result of several drivers, some of which we've previously outlined. For example, this is the first year of our Northern Ireland business, Kilroot, operating without a PPA, as Paul mentioned.
Also, while the Philippines has continued to show demand growth of 3% to 4% system-wide capacity has recovered for 2010 levels as other market generators have increased their availability, which dampens maximum beneficial impacts on the portfolio this year when compared to last.
In addition, as has been the case with many companies during this earnings cycle, we continued to be exposed to commodity price fluctuations as certain businesses, such as Yengchen, our coal fire plant in China, has significant increase the coal prices with no commensurate increase to tariff rates, has put pressure on our earnings there.
To that end, this is on a new trend unfortunately but we're managing those carefully. In the first quarter of 2011, we've moved our Eastern Energy business into discontinued operations as we had anticipated in our 2011 guidance. Outside of these factors, our operating performance has been quite solid. In Chile, we saw higher volumes driven by market demand. In addition, we were able to procure Liquefied Natural Gas for our Esso plant which last year had run with diesel. As a result, it was able to capture higher energy margins. In addition, we've realized higher volume at our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo and Full, where demand grew by 6% and 7% respectively. The quarter also benefited from contributions from Ballylumford in Northern Island, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2010. Finally, foreign exchange rates provided some tail winds in our gross margin. In particular, the Brazilian Rial appreciated nearly 9% and the Chilean peso appreciated 11%.
These factors have contributed to a consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $55 million or 6% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $620 million of gross margin, about the same as in the same quarter of 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS was $0.22 or $0.06 less than the first quarter of 2010, while we experienced higher volumes in Latin America, as well as contributions from new businesses, these are offset by higher fixed cost, higher share count and lower prices mostly in Europe. The higher fixed costs stemmed from a variety of sources some of which are timing related or non-recurring. For example, we had outage related costs from maintenance in Indianapolis and Argentina, maintenance in Panama and offtake penalties from delays at Maritza.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.30, an increase of $0.06 from the quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also impacted by a significant increase in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2011. These non-cash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign-denominated receivables and cash balances given the strengthening of the Euro and British pound since the end of 2010.
Now let's discuss cash flow.  As discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2010 was an especially good year for cash flow, driven by several non-recurring events. Specifically, the first quarter of 2010 included favorable collections of past due receivables in the Dominican Republic, as well as higher collections of that receivable in Chile. In addition, lower operating income and higher working capital in the Philippines relative to last year, combined with a loss of contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar fold last year further dampened year-over-year comparison. The first quarter of 2011 when compared to the first quarter of 2010 reflects the more normalized cash level.  As a result, our operating cash flow of $505 million was $163 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis, and lower by $101 million through $322 million on a proportional basis. 
Likewise, consolidated free cash flow decreased by $249 million to $263 million for the quarter, driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx primarily in Latin American utilities and North American utilities. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased to $159 million.
Now, turning to parent liquidity, during the quarter, Parent Company Liquidity benefited by $78 million from subsidiaries distribution, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. Since December 31, 2010, we retired $268 million of unsecured notes and repurchased $63 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.68. During the first quarter, we also invested $300 million in several construction and development projects such as Drone Heil, Mountain and Mong Duong as well as in our partnership in Koc in Turkey positioning as well for to participate in the power market privatization there. Our Parent Company Liquidity at quarter end now stands at $1.3 billion.
Before I turn the call back to Paul, I just want to comment briefly on several of the efficiency efforts we have underway as mentioned in our year-end call. Although we're in the early stages of sizing the potential cost reduction impacts of these initiatives, they include significantly leverageable effort such as additional global sourcing opportunities, outsourcing of lower value financial transaction processing and adding further automation to our financial reporting platform now that over 70% of our businesses are on an ERP system.  We are also anticipating some additional support cost opportunities as we realigned geographically as part of our new go-to-market strategy. We'll be providing additional color on these efforts in our May 19 Investor Day.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who will provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline. Paul?"

I'll just give you a quick update on the construction and those developed projects in their advanced stages of development. Our construction pipeline showed good progress doing the first quarter, with approximately 1,700 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. And over 95% of our current construction pipeline will be under long-term contract. Maritza, which is our 670 megawatt coal-fired plant in Bulgaria, remains our priority in 2011, and we've taken significant steps to resolve the issues there. Commissioning is underway and plans to obtain full design capacity by year-end. AES assumes control of the construction process while the disputes with our contractor have been submitted to arbitration. Commercial operation initially had reduced capacity is anticipated during the second quarter. Additionally, last week, we successfully concluded the final 1 unit, 72-hour capacity test at 210 megawatts net. This follows a similarly successful 2 unit 72-hour test at 420 megawatts net.
Turning to Latin America, we continue to make strong progress towards our scheduled to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518 megawatt Angamos coal fired plant in Northern Chile, which is located in the copper mining region, is fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule, with Unit 2 on schedule for the second half of 2011. In Panama, our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project is nearing completion, with the dam and powerhouse at approximately 95% complete. Commissioning and commercial operation are expected in the second half of 2011.
Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, has restricted constructions and from the Supreme Court of Chile regarding the construction permits in January. There are currently over 1,200 workers on site, our major pieces of equipment are outside as well and the project is scheduled for completion in early 2013.
Finally we have 147 megawatts of wind generation capacity in the California and PJM markets that will be completed by the end of 2011.
These projects under construction, all of which benefit from long-term power purchase agreements, will deliver meaningful earnings in 2012. When combined with PPL, these additions make for very attractive growth trajectory off of our 2010 results. 
Now let me turn to development. Projects in our advanced development pipeline will deliver growth beyond 2012, and I'd like to remind you of just a few of our key areas of focus. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. In the U.K., we reached financial close and started construction on our 30-megawatt wind project Drone Hill. This is the first of several projects resulting from our 2010 acquisition of the U.K- based wind developer. As a reminder, between the acquisition of the U.K. developer and 2 other Poland-based with developer, we have a development pipeline totaling more than 300 megawatts in the U.K. and 775 megawatts in Poland. From these pipelines, we expect 175 megawatts of projects to begin construction within the next 12 to 18 months which will require approximately $120 million of AES equity.
In India, we recently signed a 25 year power purchase agreement with the state grid company for 50.% of the output from our 1300-megawatt coal-fired OPGC II project expansion in the state of Arissa, which is a major coal producing state in India. The remaining of output will be available for bilateral contracts which will further enhance project fundamentals.  In addition, AS Solar or signed up EPA and close on that financing for 5-megawatt solar PV project in the state of Rajistan. And finally, we achieved financial close and commence construction of our 39-megawatt Surasta wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations for Surasta is expected by the end of second quarter 2011. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the market potential in India, but also AES' ability to develop and execute across diverse technologies and regions.
In Vietnam, our 1200-megawatt greenfield coal plant, Mong Duong, also achieved this significant milestone. In February, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Dusan and we executed documentation for the sale of 49% interest in the project to POSCO and to CIC. The sale will take effect at about 60 days want approval for the transfer is received from the Vietnamese government. It will not only as strategic partnerships with significant presence in Asia, but it will also increased AES' return on our investment, as well as confirming the value that AES creeds to greenfield development.
In Turkey, what we recently closed a joint venture with Koc Holding, the upcoming privatization process affords us the valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline projects. This partnership is anchored by Koc's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which have been transferred to the joint venture. We see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market where GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% and 5%. To help meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market, system capacity is projected to increase from its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, a 5% CAGR by 2015. In addition, the privatization process will put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market over 2 phases. This could be a very interesting market for us, and we think we are well-positioned with Koc as our partner.
As you can see, we still have a very look fairly robust pipeline development projects. And the natural question is how can we obtain the required capital for these investments, given the equity going forward and into the acquisition of DPL. In addition to our existing liquidity and cash distribution from our businesses, 1 of the other was that we anticipate funding is through continued portfolio management activities. And as you have seen from past asset sales in the Middle East and Kazakhstan, we've been able to achieve attractive prices through the sales. This is 1 way that we can reach the capital while the same time creating NPV for our equity folders. And the other option is evidenced in our Vietnam business is that working with partners is another way to fund opportunities and doing so in a manner that captures a premium for development and enhances returns to AES.

After",554,"Thanks, Joel, and good morning to you, all of you joining us today. Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the first quarter of 2011 and also recap key highlights of our recent announcement regarding our acquisition of DPL. After Victoria reviews the first quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on our project center construction, as well as progress on the advanced development pipeline beyond DPL.
The results for the first quarter of 2011 were in line with our expectations. We are in $0.22 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $159 million. These results were driven by the demand growth in Latin America, which helped to offset some of the negative variances that we had anticipated. There are 2 material ones which I'd like to highlight. One was our Generation business in the Philippines, where volumes declined due to the market returning to a more normal environment, with more capacity being available to the market. As you may recall, we benefited significantly last year by having our plant available when many of our competitors were suffering from outages. 2010 was an exceptional year in that regard.
Another factor related to one of our Northern Ireland plants, Kilroot, where the PPA was terminated in late 2010 in accordance with its terms. So we saw lower prices as a result of the plant selling on a merchant basis, and neither of these results was unexpected. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, as you can see on Page 19 of the investor presentation, both earnings and cash projections will increase throughout the year, as our 1,700 megawatts of construction projects come online during the latter part of the year. So we are on track and continue to expect the strong balance of the year and to achieve all of our 2011 guidance metrics.
Also, as we discussed a few weeks ago, on April 20, we signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of DPL Inc., a public holding company of Dayton Power & Light. Assuming a closing by year end, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings by $0.05 to $0.07 per share in 2012, excluding acquisition costs. This acquisition will be funded by a combination of new debt and cash-on-hand.
As we also discussed during our prior call, we are strategically focused in key geographies where we have both a competitive advantage, as well as adequate opportunities to achieve attractive returns. We've chosen these markets, one of which is the U.S., based on a combination of attractive fundamentals and AES skill sets. This acquisition is in alignment with our refined approach to new investments, which focuses on a smaller number of select markets that we believe will offer the greatest potential for long-term value creation. 
The acquisition of DPL presents us with opportunities to complement our existing utility platform in the Midwest at IPL, and to leverage the skill of our North American footprint. It also allows us to utilize our U.S. tax position efficiently. That combination has allowed us to structure a transaction that provides immediate benefits to both the AES and to the DPL shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Victoria?"
35312,131523501,124693,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a stro",1031,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a strong rest-of-year, driven primarily by new construction coming online in Chile adjusted EPS by year end. This includes $0.02 from Maritza, with stage commissioning over the rest of this year. Although both adjusted earnings and cash flow during the first quarter of 2011 are lower than during the same period last year, this is a result of several drivers, some of which we've previously outlined. For example, this is the first year of our Northern Ireland business, Kilroot, operating without a PPA, as Paul mentioned.
Also, while the Philippines has continued to show demand growth of 3% to 4%, system-wide capacity has recovered from 2010 levels as other market generators have increased their availability, which dampens Masinloc's beneficial impacts on the portfolio this year when compared to last.
In addition, as has been the case with many companies during this earnings cycle, we continued to be exposed to commodity price fluctuations, as certain businesses, such as Yangcheng, our coal fire plant in China, has significant increase the coal prices with no commensurate increase to tariff rates, has put pressure on our earnings there.
To that end, this is not a new trend, and unfortunately, but we're co-managing those carefully. In the first quarter of 2011, we've moved our Eastern Energy business into discontinued operations, as we had anticipated in our 2011 guidance. 
Outside of these factors, our operating performance has been quite solid. In Chile, we saw higher volumes driven by market demand. In addition, we were able to procure Liquefied Natural Gas for our Esso plant [ph], which last year had run with diesel. As a result, we have been able to capture higher energy margins. In addition, we've realized higher volume at our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo and Sul, where demand grew by 6% and 7%, respectively. The quarter also benefited from contributions from Ballylumford in Northern Island, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2010. 
Finally, foreign exchange rates provide some tail winds to our gross margin. In particular, the Brazilian real appreciated nearly 9%, and the Chilean peso appreciated 11%.
These factors have contributed to a consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $55 million or 6% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $620 million of gross margin, about the same as in the same quarter of 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS was $0.22 or $0.06 less than the first quarter of 2010. While we experienced higher volumes in Latin America, as well as contributions from new businesses, these were offset by higher fixed costs, higher share count and lower prices mostly in Europe. The higher fixed costs stemmed from a variety of sources, some of which are timing-related or non-incurring. For example, we had outage-related costs from scheduled maintenance in Indianapolis and Argentina, maintenance in Panama and offtaker penalties from delays at Maritza.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.30, an increase of $0.06 from the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also impacted by a significant increase in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2011. These noncash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign-denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010.
Now let's discuss cash flow. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2010 was an especially good year for cash flow, driven by several non-recurring events. Specifically, the first quarter of 2010 included favorable collections of past-due receivables in the Dominican Republic, as well as higher collections of that receivable in Chile. In addition, lower operating income and higher working capital in the Philippines relative to last year, combined with a loss of contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar, sold last year, further dampened the year-over-year comparison. 
The first quarter of 2011, when compared to the first quarter of 2010, reflects a more normalized cash level.  As a result, our operating cash flow of $505 million was $163 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $101 million to $322 million on a proportional basis. 
Likewise, consolidated free cash flow decreased by $249 million to $263 million for the quarter, driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx primarily in Latin American utilities and North American utilities. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased to $159 million.
Now turning to Parent liquidity. During the quarter, Parent Company Liquidity benefited by $78 million from subsidiaries distribution, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. Since December 31, 2010, we retired $268 million of unsecured notes and repurchased $63 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.68. During the first quarter, we also invested $300 million in several construction and development projects, such as Drone Hill, Laurel Mountain and Mong Duong, as well as in our partnership in Koç in Turkey, positioning as well to participate in the power market privatization there. Our Parent Company Liquidity at quarter end now stands at $1.3 billion.
Before I turn the call back to Paul, I just want to comment briefly on several of the efficiency efforts we have underway, as mentioned in our year-end call. Although we're in the early stages of sizing the potential cost reduction impacts of these initiatives, they include significantly leverageable efforts, such as additional global sourcing opportunities, outsourcing of lower-value financial transaction processing and adding further automation to our financial reporting platform, now that over 70% of our businesses are on an ERP system. We are also anticipating some additional support cost opportunities, as we realign geographically as part of our new go-to-market strategy. We'll be providing additional color on these efforts during May 19 Investor Day.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who will provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline. Paul?"

Our construction pipeline showed good progress during the first quarter, with approximately 1,700 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. And over 95% of our current construction pipeline will be under long-term contract. 
Maritza, which is our 670 megawatt coal-fired plant in Bulgaria, remains our priority in 2011, and we've taken significant steps to resolve the issues there. Commissioning is underway, with plans to obtain full design capacity by year end. AES has assumed control of the construction process, while the disputes with our contractor have been submitted to arbitration. Commercial operation initially at a reduced capacity is anticipated during the second quarter. Additionally, last week, we successfully concluded the final 1-unit, 72-hour capacity test at 210 megawatts net. This follows a similarly successful 2-unit, 72-hour test at 420 megawatts net.
Turning to Latin America. We continue to make strong progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518-megawatt Angamos coal-fired plant in Northern Chile, which is located in the copper mining region, is fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule, with Unit 2 on schedule for the second half of 2011. 
In Panama, our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project is nearing completion, with the dam and powerhouse at approximately 95% complete. Commissioning and commercial operation are expected in the second half of 2011.
Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, has restarted constructions since obtaining the favorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Chile regarding the construction permits in January. There are currently over 1,200 workers on site, all major pieces of equipment are on site as well, and the project is scheduled for completion in early 2013.
Finally, we have 147 megawatts of wind-generation capacity in the California and PJM markets that will be completed by the end of 2011. These projects under construction, all of which benefit from long-term power purchase agreements, will deliver meaningful earnings in 2012. When combined with PPL, these additions make for very attractive growth trajectory off of our 2010 results. 
Now let me turn to development. Projects in our advanced development pipeline will deliver growth beyond 2012, and I'd like to remind you of just a few of our key areas of focus. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. In the U.K., we reached financial close and started construction on our 30-megawatt wind project, Drone Hill. This is the first of several projects resulting from our 2010 acquisition of a U.K.-based wind developer. As a reminder, between the acquisition of the U.K. developer and 2 other Poland-based wind developers, we have a development pipeline totaling more than 300 megawatts in the U.K. and 775 megawatts in Poland. From these pipelines, we expect 175 megawatts of projects to begin construction within the next 12 to 18 months, which will require approximately $120 million of AES equity.
In India, we recently signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with a state grid company for 50% of the output from our 1,300-megawatt, coal-fired OPGC II project expansion in the state of Orissa, which is a major coal-producing state in India. The remaining output will be available for bilateral contracts, which will further enhance the project fundamentals. In addition, AES Solar or signed up PPA and closed on debt financing for our 5-megawatt solar PV project in the state of Rajasthan. 
And finally, we achieved financial close and commenced construction of our 39-megawatt Saurashtra wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations for Saurashtra is expected by the end of second quarter 2011. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the market potential in India, but also AES' ability to develop and execute across diverse technologies and regions.
In Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant, Mong Duong, also achieved this significant milestone. In February, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Doosan, and we executed documentation for the sale of 49% interest in the project to POSCO and to CIC. The sale will take effect in about 60 days once approval for the transfer is received from the Vietnamese government. It will not only add strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but it will also increased AES' return on our investment, as well as confirming the value that AES creates to greenfield development.
In Turkey, where we recently closed a joint venture with Koç Holding, the upcoming privatization process affords us the valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline projects. This partnership is anchored by Koç's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which have been transferred to the joint venture. We see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market, where GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% and 5%. To help meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market, system capacity is projected to increase from its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, a 5% CAGR by 2015. In addition, the privatization process would put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market over 2 phases. This could be a very interesting market for us, and we think we are well-positioned with Koç as our partner.
As you can see, we still have a very look fairly robust pipeline of development projects. And the natural question is how can we obtain the required capital for these investments, given the equity going forward and into the acquisition of DPL. In addition to our existing liquidity and cash distributions from our businesses, one of the other ways that we anticipate funding is through continued portfolio management activities. 
And as you have seen with the past asset sales in the Middle East and Kazakhstan, we have been able to achieve attractive prices through these sales. This is one way that we can raise new capital, while, at the same time, creating NPV for our equity folders. And the other option is evidenced in our Vietnam businesses that working with partners is another way to fund opportunities and doing so in a manner that captures a premium for development and enhances returns to AES.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator who will open up the call for your questions. Ed,  could you please open up the call for questions?"

After",553,"Thanks, Joel, and good morning to you, all of you joining us today. Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the first quarter of 2011 and also recap key highlights of our recent announcement regarding our acquisition of DPL. After Victoria reviews the first quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on our project center construction, as well as progress on the advanced development pipeline beyond DPL.
The results for the first quarter of 2011 were in line with our expectations. We earned $0.22 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $159 million. These results were driven by the demand growth in Latin America, which helped to offset some of the negative variances that we had anticipated. There are 2 material ones which I'd like to highlight. One was our Generation business in the Philippines, where volumes declined due to the market returning to a more normal environment with more capacity being available to the market. As you may recall, we benefited significantly last year by having our plant available when many of our competitors were suffering from outages. 2010 was an exceptional year in that regard.
Another factor related to one of our Northern Ireland plants, Kilroot, where the PPA was terminated in late 2010 in accordance with its terms. So we saw lower prices as a result of the plant selling on a merchant basis, and neither of these results was unexpected. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, as you can see on Page 19 of the investor presentation, both earnings and cash projections will increase throughout the year as our 1,700 megawatts of construction projects come online during the latter part of the year. So we are on track and continue to expect a strong balance of the year and to achieve all of our 2011 guidance metrics.
Also, as we discussed a few weeks ago, on April 20, we signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of DPL Inc., a public holding company of Dayton Power & Light. Assuming a closing by year end, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings by $0.05 to $0.07 per share in 2012, excluding acquisition costs. This acquisition will be funded by a combination of new debt and cash-on-hand.
As we also discussed during our prior call, we are strategically focused in key geographies where we have both a competitive advantage, as well as adequate opportunities to achieve attractive returns. We've chosen these markets, one of which is the U.S., based on a combination of attractive fundamentals and AES' skill sets. This acquisition is in alignment with our refined approach to new investments, which focuses on a smaller number of select markets that we believe will offer the greatest potential for long-term value creation. 
The acquisition of DPL presents us with opportunities to complement our existing utility platform in the Midwest at IPL, and to leverage the skill of our North American footprint. It also allows us to utilize our U.S. tax position efficiently. That combination has allowed us to structure a transaction that provides immediate benefits to both the AES and to the DPL shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Victoria?"

As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a stro",1032,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a strong rest-of-year, driven primarily by new construction coming online in Chile adjusted EPS by year end. This includes $0.02 from Maritza, with staged commissioning over the rest of this year. Although both adjusted earnings and cash flow during the first quarter of 2011 are lower than during the same period last year, this is a result of several drivers, some of which we've previously outlined. For example, this is the first year of our Northern Ireland business, Kilroot, operating without a PPA, as Paul mentioned.
Also, while the Philippines has continued to show demand growth of 3% to 4%, system-wide capacity has recovered from 2010 levels as other market generators have increased their availability, which dampens Masinloc's beneficial impact on the portfolio this year when compared to last.
In addition, as has been the case with many companies during this earnings cycle, we continued to be exposed to commodity price fluctuations, as certain businesses, such as Yangcheng, our coal fire plant in China, had significant increase to coal prices with no commensurate increase to tariff rates has put pressure on our earnings there.
To that end, this is not a new trend, and unfortunately, but we're co-managing those carefully. In the first quarter of 2011, we've moved our Eastern Energy business into discontinued operations, as we had anticipated in our 2011 guidance. 
Outside of these factors, our operating performance has been quite solid. In Chile, we saw higher volumes driven by market demand. In addition, we were able to procure Liquefied Natural Gas for our Esso plant [ph], which last year had run with diesel. As a result, we have been able to capture higher energy margins. In addition, we've realized higher volume at our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo and Sul, where demand grew by 6% and 7%, respectively. The quarter also benefited from contributions from Ballylumford in Northern Island, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2010. 
Finally, foreign exchange rates provide some tail winds to our gross margin. In particular, the Brazilian real appreciated nearly 9%, and the Chilean peso appreciated 11%.
These factors have contributed to a consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $55 million or 6% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $620 million of gross margin, about the same as in the same quarter of 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS was $0.22 or $0.06 less than the first quarter of 2010. While we experienced higher volumes in Latin America, as well as contributions from new businesses, these were offset by higher fixed costs, higher share count and lower prices, mostly in Europe. The higher fixed costs stemmed from a variety of sources, some of which are timing-related or non-recurring. For example, we had outage-related costs from scheduled maintenance in Indianapolis and Argentina, maintenance in Panama and off-taker penalties from delays at Maritza.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.30, an increase of $0.06 from the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also impacted by a significant increase in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2011. These noncash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign-denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010.
Now let's discuss cash flow. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2010 was an especially good year for cash flow, driven by several non-recurring events. Specifically, the first quarter of 2010 included favorable collections of past-due receivables in the Dominican Republic, as well as higher collections of VAT receivables in Chile. In addition, lower operating income and higher working capital in the Philippines relative to last year, combined with a loss of contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar, sold last year, further dampened the year-over-year comparison. 
The first quarter of 2011, when compared to the first quarter of 2010, reflects a more normalized cash level.  As a result, our operating cash flow of $505 million was $163 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $101 million to $322 million on a proportional basis. 
Likewise, consolidated free cash flow decreased by $249 million to $263 million for the quarter, driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx, primarily in Latin American utilities and North American utilities. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased to $159 million.
Now turning to Parent liquidity. During the quarter, Parent Company Liquidity benefited by $78 million from subsidiaries distribution, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. Since December 31, 2010, we retired $268 million of unsecured notes and repurchased $63 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.68. During the first quarter, we also invested $300 million in several construction and development projects, such as Drone Hill, Laurel Mountain and Mong Duong, as well as in our partnership with Koç in Turkey, positioning as well to participate in the power market privatization there. Our Parent Company Liquidity at quarter end now stands at $1.3 billion.
Before I turn the call back to Paul, I just want to comment briefly on several of the efficiency efforts we have underway, as mentioned in our year-end call. Although we're in the early stages of sizing the potential cost reduction impacts of these initiatives, they include significantly leverage-able efforts, such as additional global sourcing opportunities, outsourcing of lower-value financial transaction processing and adding further automation to our financial reporting platform, now that over 70% of our businesses are on an ERP system. We are also anticipating some additional support cost opportunities, as we realign geographically as part of our new go-to-market strategy. We'll be providing additional color on these efforts during our May 19 Investor Day.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who will provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline. Paul?"

Now what I'll do is I'll just give you a quick update on the construction and those development projects that are in advanced stages of development. Our construction pipeline showed good progress during the first quarter with approximately 1,700 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. And over 95% of our current construction pipeline will be under long-term contract. 
Maritza, which is our 670 megawatt coal-fired plant in Bulgaria, remains our priority in 2011, and we've taken significant steps to resolve the issues there. Commissioning is underway, with plans to obtain full design capacity by year end. AES has assumed control of the construction process, while the disputes with our contractor have been submitted to arbitration. Commercial operation, initially at a reduced capacity, is anticipated during the second quarter. Additionally, last week, we successfully concluded the final 1-unit, 72-hour capacity test at 210 megawatts net. This follows a similarly successful 2-unit, 72-hour test at 420 megawatts net.
Turning to Latin America. We continue to make strong progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518-megawatt Angamos coal-fired plant in Northern Chile, which is located in the copper mining region, has fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule, with Unit 2 on schedule for the second half of 2011. 
In Panama, our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project is nearing completion, with the dam and powerhouse at approximately 95% complete. Commissioning and commercial operation are expected in the second half of 2011.
Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, has restarted construction since obtaining the favorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Chile regarding the construction permits in January. There are currently over 1,200 workers on site, all major pieces of equipment are on site as well, and the project is scheduled for completion in early 2013.
Finally, we have 147 megawatts of wind-generation capacity in the California and PJM markets that will be completed by the end of 2011. These projects under construction, all of which benefit from long-term power purchase agreements, will deliver meaningful earnings in 2012. When combined with PPL, these additions make for a very attractive growth trajectory off of our 2010 results. 
Now let me turn to development. Projects in our advanced development pipeline will deliver growth beyond 2012, and I'd like to remind you of just a few of our key areas of focus. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. In the U.K., we reached financial close and started construction on our 30-megawatt wind project, Drone Hill. This is the first of several projects resulting from our 2010 acquisition of a U.K.-based wind developer. As a reminder, between the acquisition of the U.K. developer and 2 other Poland-based wind developers, we have a development pipeline totaling more than 300 megawatts in the U.K. and 775 megawatts in Poland. From these pipelines, we expect 175 megawatts of projects to begin construction within the next 12 to 18 months, which will require approximately $120 million of AES equity.
In India, we recently signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with a state grid company for 50% of the output from our 1,300-megawatt, coal-fired OPGC II project expansion in the state of Orissa, which is a major coal-producing state in India. The remaining output will be available for bilateral contracts, which will further enhance the project fundamentals. In addition, AES Solar signed a PPA and closed on debt financing for our 5-megawatt solar PV project in the state of Rajasthan. 
And finally, we achieved financial close and commenced construction of our 39-megawatt Saurashtra wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations for Saurashtra is expected by the end of second quarter 2011. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the market potential in India, but also AES' ability to develop and execute across diverse technologies and regions.
In Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant, Mong Duong, also achieved this significant milestone. In February, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Doosan, and we executed documentation for the sale of 49% interest in the project to POSCO and to CIC. The sale will take effect in about 60 days once approval for the transfer is received from the Vietnamese government. It will not only add strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but it will also increase AES' return on our investment, as well as confirming the value that AES creates to greenfield development.
In Turkey, where we recently closed on a joint venture with Koç Holding, the upcoming privatization process affords us the valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline of projects. This partnership is anchored by Koç's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which have been transferred to the joint venture. We see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market, where GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% and 5%. To help meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market, system capacity is projected to increase from its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, a 5% CAGR by 2015. In addition, the privatization process would put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market over 2 phases. This could be a very interesting market for us, and we think we are well-positioned with Koç as our partner.
As you can see, we still have a fairly robust pipeline of development projects. And the natural question is how can we obtain the required capital for these investments, given the equity going forward into the acquisition of DPL. In addition to our existing liquidity and cash distributions from our businesses, one of the other ways that we anticipate funding is through continued portfolio management activities. 
And as you have seen with the past asset sales in the Middle East and Kazakhstan, we have been able to achieve attractive prices through these sales. This is one way that we can raise new capital, while, at the same time, creating NPV for our equity folders. And the other option as evidenced in our Vietnam businesses is that working with partners is another way to fund opportunities and doing so in a manner that captures a premium for development and enhances returns to AES.

After",553,"Thanks, Joel, and good morning to you, all of you joining us today. Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the first quarter of 2011 and also recap key highlights of our recent announcement regarding our acquisition of DPL. After Victoria reviews the first quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on our project center construction, as well as progress on the advanced development pipeline beyond DPL.
The results for the first quarter of 2011 were in line with our expectations. We earned $0.22 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $159 million. These results were driven by the demand growth in Latin America, which helped to offset some of the negative variances that we had anticipated. There are 2 material ones which I'd like to highlight. One was our Generation business in the Philippines, where volumes declined due to the market returning to a more normal environment with more capacity being available to the market. As you may recall, we benefited significantly last year by having our plant available when many of our competitors were suffering from outages. 2010 was an exceptional year in that regard.
Another factor related to one of our Northern Ireland plants, Kilroot, where the PPA was terminated in late 2010 in accordance with its terms. So we saw lower prices as a result of the plant selling on a merchant basis, and neither of these results was unexpected. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, as you can see on Page 19 of the investor presentation, both earnings and cash projections will increase throughout the year as our 1,700 megawatts of construction projects come online during the latter part of the year. So we are on track and continue to expect a strong balance of the year and to achieve all of our 2011 guidance metrics.
Also, as we discussed a few weeks ago, on April 20, we signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of DPL Inc., a public holding company of Dayton Power & Light. Assuming a closing by year end, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings by $0.05 to $0.07 per share in 2012, excluding acquisition costs. This acquisition will be funded by a combination of new debt and cash-on-hand.
As we also discussed during our prior call, we are strategically focused in key geographies where we have both a competitive advantage, as well as adequate opportunities to achieve attractive returns. We've chosen these markets, one of which is the U.S., based on a combination of attractive fundamentals and AES' skill sets. This acquisition is in alignment with our refined approach to new investments, which focuses on a smaller number of select markets that we believe will offer the greatest potential for long-term value creation. 
The acquisition of DPL presents us with opportunities to complement our existing utility platform in the Midwest at IPL, and to leverage the skill of our North American footprint. It also allows us to utilize our U.S. tax position efficiently. That combination has allowed us to structure a transaction that provides immediate benefits to both the AES and to the DPL shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Victoria?"
35312,131523501,124927,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a stro",1032,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, the first quarter results are in line with our expectations and consistent with operating trends and construction timelines we have previously incorporated in our 2011 guidance. We expect a strong rest-of-year, driven primarily by new construction coming online in Chile adjusted EPS by year end. This includes $0.02 from Maritza, with staged commissioning over the rest of this year. Although both adjusted earnings and cash flow during the first quarter of 2011 are lower than during the same period last year, this is a result of several drivers, some of which we've previously outlined. For example, this is the first year of our Northern Ireland business, Kilroot, operating without a PPA, as Paul mentioned.
Also, while the Philippines has continued to show demand growth of 3% to 4%, system-wide capacity has recovered from 2010 levels as other market generators have increased their availability, which dampens Masinloc's beneficial impact on the portfolio this year when compared to last.
In addition, as has been the case with many companies during this earnings cycle, we continued to be exposed to commodity price fluctuations, as certain businesses, such as Yangcheng, our coal fire plant in China, had significant increase to coal prices with no commensurate increase to tariff rates has put pressure on our earnings there.
To that end, this is not a new trend, and unfortunately, but we're co-managing those carefully. In the first quarter of 2011, we've moved our Eastern Energy business into discontinued operations, as we had anticipated in our 2011 guidance. 
Outside of these factors, our operating performance has been quite solid. In Chile, we saw higher volumes driven by market demand. In addition, we were able to procure Liquefied Natural Gas for our Esso plant [ph], which last year had run with diesel. As a result, we have been able to capture higher energy margins. In addition, we've realized higher volume at our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo and Sul, where demand grew by 6% and 7%, respectively. The quarter also benefited from contributions from Ballylumford in Northern Island, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2010. 
Finally, foreign exchange rates provide some tail winds to our gross margin. In particular, the Brazilian real appreciated nearly 9%, and the Chilean peso appreciated 11%.
These factors have contributed to a consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $55 million or 6% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $620 million of gross margin, about the same as in the same quarter of 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS was $0.22 or $0.06 less than the first quarter of 2010. While we experienced higher volumes in Latin America, as well as contributions from new businesses, these were offset by higher fixed costs, higher share count and lower prices, mostly in Europe. The higher fixed costs stemmed from a variety of sources, some of which are timing-related or non-recurring. For example, we had outage-related costs from scheduled maintenance in Indianapolis and Argentina, maintenance in Panama and off-taker penalties from delays at Maritza.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.30, an increase of $0.06 from the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also impacted by a significant increase in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2011. These noncash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign-denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010.
Now let's discuss cash flow. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2010 was an especially good year for cash flow, driven by several non-recurring events. Specifically, the first quarter of 2010 included favorable collections of past-due receivables in the Dominican Republic, as well as higher collections of VAT receivables in Chile. In addition, lower operating income and higher working capital in the Philippines relative to last year, combined with a loss of contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar, sold last year, further dampened the year-over-year comparison. 
The first quarter of 2011, when compared to the first quarter of 2010, reflects a more normalized cash level.  As a result, our operating cash flow of $505 million was $163 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $101 million to $322 million on a proportional basis. 
Likewise, consolidated free cash flow decreased by $249 million to $263 million for the quarter, driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx, primarily in Latin American utilities and North American utilities. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased to $159 million.
Now turning to Parent liquidity. During the quarter, Parent Company Liquidity benefited by $78 million from subsidiaries distribution, net of corporate overhead and interest expense. Since December 31, 2010, we retired $268 million of unsecured notes and repurchased $63 million of AES stock at an average price of $12.68. During the first quarter, we also invested $300 million in several construction and development projects, such as Drone Hill, Laurel Mountain and Mong Duong, as well as in our partnership with Koç in Turkey, positioning as well to participate in the power market privatization there. Our Parent Company Liquidity at quarter end now stands at $1.3 billion.
Before I turn the call back to Paul, I just want to comment briefly on several of the efficiency efforts we have underway, as mentioned in our year-end call. Although we're in the early stages of sizing the potential cost reduction impacts of these initiatives, they include significantly leverage-able efforts, such as additional global sourcing opportunities, outsourcing of lower-value financial transaction processing and adding further automation to our financial reporting platform, now that over 70% of our businesses are on an ERP system. We are also anticipating some additional support cost opportunities, as we realign geographically as part of our new go-to-market strategy. We'll be providing additional color on these efforts during our May 19 Investor Day.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who will provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline. Paul?"

Now what I'll do is I'll just give you a quick update on the construction and those development projects that are in advanced stages of development.

Now what I'll do is I'll just give you a quick update on the construction and those development projects that are in advanced stages of development. Our construction pipeline showed good progress during the first quarter with approximately 1,700 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. And over 95% of our current construction pipeline will be under long-term contract. 
Maritza, which is our 670 megawatt coal-fired plant in Bulgaria, remains our priority in 2011, and we've taken significant steps to resolve the issues there. Commissioning is underway, with plans to obtain full design capacity by year end. AES has assumed control of the construction process, while the disputes with our contractor have been submitted to arbitration. Commercial operation, initially at a reduced capacity, is anticipated during the second quarter. Additionally, last week, we successfully concluded the final 1-unit, 72-hour capacity test at 210 megawatts net. This follows a similarly successful 2-unit, 72-hour test at 420 megawatts net.
Turning to Latin America. We continue to make strong progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518-megawatt Angamos coal-fired plant in Northern Chile, which is located in the copper mining region, has fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule, with Unit 2 on schedule for the second half of 2011. 
In Panama, our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project is nearing completion, with the dam and powerhouse at approximately 95% complete. Commissioning and commercial operation are expected in the second half of 2011.
Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, has restarted construction since obtaining the favorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Chile regarding the construction permits in January. There are currently over 1,200 workers on site, all major pieces of equipment are on site as well, and the project is scheduled for completion in early 2013.
Finally, we have 147 megawatts of wind-generation capacity in the California and PJM markets that will be completed by the end of 2011. These projects under construction, all of which benefit from long-term power purchase agreements, will deliver meaningful earnings in 2012. When combined with PPL, these additions make for a very attractive growth trajectory off of our 2010 results. 
Now let me turn to development. Projects in our advanced development pipeline will deliver growth beyond 2012, and I'd like to remind you of just a few of our key areas of focus. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. In the U.K., we reached financial close and started construction on our 30-megawatt wind project, Drone Hill. This is the first of several projects resulting from our 2010 acquisition of a U.K.-based wind developer. As a reminder, between the acquisition of the U.K. developer and 2 other Poland-based wind developers, we have a development pipeline totaling more than 300 megawatts in the U.K. and 775 megawatts in Poland. From these pipelines, we expect 175 megawatts of projects to begin construction within the next 12 to 18 months, which will require approximately $120 million of AES equity.
In India, we recently signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with a state grid company for 50% of the output from our 1,300-megawatt, coal-fired OPGC II project expansion in the state of Orissa, which is a major coal-producing state in India. The remaining output will be available for bilateral contracts, which will further enhance the project fundamentals. In addition, AES Solar signed a PPA and closed on debt financing for our 5-megawatt solar PV project in the state of Rajasthan. 
And finally, we achieved financial close and commenced construction of our 39-megawatt Saurashtra wind project in Gujarat. Commercial operations for Saurashtra is expected by the end of second quarter 2011. Each of these projects is a testament of not only the market potential in India, but also AES' ability to develop and execute across diverse technologies and regions.
In Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant, Mong Duong, also achieved this significant milestone. In February, we signed a turnkey EPC agreement with Doosan, and we executed documentation for the sale of 49% interest in the project to POSCO and to CIC. The sale will take effect in about 60 days once approval for the transfer is received from the Vietnamese government. It will not only add strategic partners with significant presence in Asia, but it will also increase AES' return on our investment, as well as confirming the value that AES creates to greenfield development.
In Turkey, where we recently closed on a joint venture with Koç Holding, the upcoming privatization process affords us the valuable opportunity to develop a pipeline of projects. This partnership is anchored by Koç's 300-megawatt natural gas facilities, which have been transferred to the joint venture. We see a lot of potential in the Turkish power market, where GDP is expected to grow between 4.5% and 5%. To help meet this growth in what is currently an underserved market, system capacity is projected to increase from its current 46 gigawatts to approximately 59 gigawatts, a 5% CAGR by 2015. In addition, the privatization process would put 15 gigawatts of generation capacity on the market over 2 phases. This could be a very interesting market for us, and we think we are well-positioned with Koç as our partner.
As you can see, we still have a fairly robust pipeline of development projects. And the natural question is how can we obtain the required capital for these investments, given the equity going forward into the acquisition of DPL. In addition to our existing liquidity and cash distributions from our businesses, one of the other ways that we anticipate funding is through continued portfolio management activities. 
And as you have seen with the past asset sales in the Middle East and Kazakhstan, we have been able to achieve attractive prices through these sales. This is one way that we can raise new capital, while, at the same time, creating NPV for our equity folders. And the other option as evidenced in our Vietnam businesses is that working with partners is another way to fund opportunities and doing so in a manner that captures a premium for development and enhances returns to AES.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator who will open up the call for your questions. Ed,  could you please open up the call for questions?"

Tail briefly comment on our financial performance during the second quarter of 2011. After Victoria reviews the second quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on several of our other significant projects under construction, as well as our progress on the development pipeline. 
In the second quarter, we achieved the growth versus the first quarter we were expecting, putting us on the trajectory to hit our full year guidance. Excluding costs associated with our pending DPL acquisition, we earned $0.32 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $181 million. Year-to-date, we have earned $0.54 of adjusted EPS, which is approximately 50% of the midpoint of our full year guidance of $1.08 to $1.14 prior to the impact of DPL. 
this strong quarter was driven by volume growth in Chile from both existing plants, as well as contributions from Unit 1 and our new coal fire plant in the northern grid, Angamos, which came online in April. Of course, as we indicated last quarter, we did see unfavorable year-over-year trends at our generation businesses in the Philippines and Hungary. Also, our previously disclosed repair efforts in Panama, where we had a partial total collapse in one of our hydroelectric plants continued to impact both earnings and free cash flow. These negative impacts were anticipated, however, and repairs to the tunnel for our Panama hydro plant will be completed during the second half of 2012. Thus, we remain on track to achieve our 2011 guidance. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Victoria who will discuss the results for the quarter, and update you on our cost cutting program, which as we mentioned during our Investor Day, will be one of our key drivers of earnings growth, in addition to bringing our construction pipeline in its operation. Victoria?"
35312,138847291,153150,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well a",1561,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well as our liquidity status. Finally I'll provide an update on our efficiency efforts today.
First, our key operating drivers. Foreign exchange rates largely moved in our favor during the quarter. As a reminder, many of our businesses operate in currencies other than the dollar, and therefore benefit when those currencies appreciate relative to the dollar. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, the Brazilian real and the euro both appreciated by almost 13%, while the Philippine peso rose approximately 5%. As a result, favorable foreign exchange contributed to improved earnings. 
Likewise, volume was favorable as most growth trends in Latin America continued. Our Brazilian utilities had growth of 3%, while our generation businesses in Argentina and Chile had volume growth of 7% and 26% respectively. In Asia and Europe, the volume trends were consistent with our expectations. You may recall that our generation businesses in the Philippines, Masinloc, benefited from higher than expected demand growth of 10% last year, which coupled with low availability at competitors' base load plants benefited us with very favorable spot prices. This year by comparison, lower demand driven by relatively cooler weather and better system availability did not provide the same favorability. 
In Europe, our merchant generation business at Hungary also felt the effect of lower volumes due to lower demand. In addition, we've seen challenging pricing in certain markets where we are no longer benefiting from long-term contract pricing. I've mentioned on pass calls as the PPA at Kilroot in Northern Ireland came to the end of its in and the fourth quarter of 2010. Since then, we've been operating under less favorable merchant prices. In addition, annual tariff adjustments in Brazil have suppressed the earnings of our utilities there. 
Beyond these base business drivers in the second quarter, we began to realize the material contribution from 2 of our major projects coming online this year. At our Maritza plant in Bulgaria, revenue generated from the partial COD achieved in June helped gross margin. And Angamos is in Chile, the early COD of Unit 1 also contributed incrementally from the first time this year. Together, these 2 businesses had a positive impact on proportional gross margin of over $30 million relative to the second quarter of 2010 and relative to the first quarter of 2011.
A significant offset to these positive trends was the previously disclosed outage at ST, our hydroelectric plant in Panama. A partial tunnel collapse in late 2010 and subsequent repair work have exposed the plant to very high spot pricing of purchase power to satisfy its contractual obligations. Receipt of insurance proceeds covering both the repair and the business interruption are anticipated in the second half of this year. 
The plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. All of these key drivers contributed to a second quarter consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $17 million or 2% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $619 million of gross margin, an increase of 4% relative to 2010.
You'll note that this increase in gross margin of 2% is well below the rate of increase in revenue, which accelerated by 16%. I'd like to take a moment to provide some context for this dynamic. Revenue increased at a higher rate than gross margin, partially as a result of the passthrough of fuel costs and purchase energy which increased revenue but did not have a corresponding impact on gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by the forced outage in Panama due to the tunnel work there. In addition, there was some one-time charges such as regulatory school and Brazil and a bad in Herrara in Chile in 2010. In some cases, these higher fixed cost are compensated for in the tariff process, meaning we'll see offsetting benefits in future billing periods. 
Examples of this include higher people costs in Ukraine and contract services relative to demand management systems at IPL. That said, managing fixed costs is a top priority for management and to the initiatives we outlined previously we expect to reverse this trend wherever possible.
In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.32, excluding $0.04 of costs related to the pending DPL acquisition. This represents an increase of $0.08 from the second quarter of 2010. In addition to the gross margin drivers I've just reviewed, we continue to benefit from an implied effective tax rate due to the trip of renewals of CHIPRA, a U.S. tax law in the fourth quarter of 2010, which impacts distribution through certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.24, an increase of $0.05 from second quarter 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also affected by an increase of $0.07 in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010. These non-cash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010. This is partially offset by the $0.04 loss form the impairment of Kelantissa, our generation business in Sri Lanka. 
Now, let's discuss cash flow. The cash flow results reflect some of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, we saw growth in operating cash flow from Latin America, which was offset by declines in Asia and North America. Although our Eastern Energy business is in now accounted for in discontinued operations as we work through the terms of their sale, they will still negatively affect consolidated cash flow. Additionally, Eastern was negatively impacted year-over-year by the expiration of hedges which is benefited from 2010. In addition, we lost the contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar subsequent to their sale in 2010. As a result, our operating cash flow of $675 million was $72 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $72 million to $294 million on a proportional basis. 
Consolidated free cash flow decreased by $128 million to $460 million for the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx primarily at utilities in North America and Cameroon. It's important to note that we expect the free cash flow trend at Panama to improve in the second half by the receipt of the insurance proceeds.  On a proportional basis our free cash flow decreased $101 million to $148 million. 
Now, turning to Parent Company Liquidity. During the quarter, Parent Company Liquidity benefited from the $2 billion debt offerings we completed which are earmarked from the acquisition of DPL at close. In addition, we received $167 million from subsidiary distributions net of corporate overhead and cash interest expense during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we retired $200 million of senior secured term loan due in August. Additionally, we spent $145 million for several construction and development projects such as Maritza in Bulgaria, Laurel Mountain in U.S., Mong Duong, our coal project in Vietnam, and completed our partnership with Coach in Turkey in advance of the privatization there. Finally, we repurchased approximately $36 million of shares during the quarter.
Concluding the proceeds of the DPL acquisition financing, our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $3.1 billion, up $1.8 billion versus the first quarter of 2011. Without the DPL infusion, liquidity would have been $1.1 billion, a decrease of $200 million versus the first quarter of 2011. 
I'd like to take a moment now to update you on our overhead transformation program. Back in May, at our investor conference, I introduced AES the transformation program to improve cost effectiveness and efficiencies across AES. We expect this initiative to yield $100 million in run rate savings by the end of 2014. During the second quarter, we gained momentum on these initiatives, including outsourcing high-volume financial transaction processes, such as accounts payable and general accounting. We expect to implement outsourcing in Asia and portions of Europe by year-end. In addition, we are in the beginning stages of enhancing and expanding our utilization of financial systems. This provides flexibility to meet multiple reporting needs, streamlining data collection and increasing automation.
In summary, the quarter was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the full year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.08 to $1.14, excluding DPL acquisition costs. I would note excluding DPL costs, returning toward the higher end of this range of earnings. That said, our estimates for the DPL acquisition costs may move up to a $0.13 relative to the $0.11 previously discussed due to additional interest costs in 2011. 
Given the projected trends and interest rates, we decided to access the Capital Markets early to lock in long-term financing, attractive rates consistent with our assumptions. In total, this leaves us squarely within the range of our adjusted EPS guidance inclusive of DPL cost of $0.97 to $1.03.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who will provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline."

Before I give an update on the construction development projects, I'd like to take a moment and review the recent announcement of the proposed sale of our Telecom business in Brazil. I think the sale is a good example of how we think about portfolio management, and how it can add value to the company. In early July, our Brazilian affiliate, Brasiliana, entered into an agreement to sell 2 Telecommunication businesses for BRL 1.6 billion or approximately $1 billion U.S. A portion of the proceeds will accrue to the shareholders of Eletropaulo with remainder flowing to Brasiliana, of which we have approximately 46%. Although a final decision has not been made, one possible use of these proceeds will be to pay down some very expensive debt at Brasiliana, which carries a 14% interest rate. For our share of Brasiliana, we anticipate recording a one-time gain in excess of $200 million in the transaction in 2011, and on an ongoing basis, we expect it to be accretive to our earnings beginning in 2012 due to the reduction of debt. 
Now let me turn to our construction program. We continue to make good progress during the second quarter with approximately 950 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. On June 3, our 670 megawatt Maritza coal-fired power plant from Bulgaria was placed in the commercial operation at an initial capacity of 494 megawatts on a gross megawatt basis. As of July 21, the capacity has been tested at 630 megawatts in line with our plan to reach design capacity of 670 megawatts gross by year-end.
In addition as you may recall we terminated contractor for the Maritza project, Olston, on March 21. We'd also requested payment for the performance security posted by the contractor, and on July 6, we received a positive ruling from the court of Rosai, and therefore thereafter received payment of the full amount of demands made under the performance security in the amount of approximately EUR 155 million. 
Now turning to Latin America, we continue to make good progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518 megawatt Angamos coal fire plant in northern Chile has fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule. More importantly for the bottom line, Unit 1 achieved a 12% higher output and 6% better efficiency than was guaranteed by the EPC contract. Yet it too has reached its full load operation. It's on schedule to reach its full commercial operation date by the middle of September, which is ahead of its scheduled completion date. 
During the second quarter, we also continued making progress with the Changuinola hydro project in Panama for the reservoir for 223 megawatt hydropower and starting early commissioning activities. Our current forecast is to have the first hydro unit in operation in mid-September and the second unit in operation by October. Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal fire project in Chile also continued progressing well towards it scheduled completion in early 2013. 
In addition we have 262 megawatts of wind generation capacity in United states, China, Europe and India under construction and targeted for completion by the end of 2011. 
Finally, AES Solar continues to successfully develop and construct projects. We have 127 megawatts in operation, 31 megawatts under construction and expect another 118 to enter construction by the end of the year. Including the 32 megawatts that came online during the quarter, this will bring the total megawatts online to 277 megawatts by the end of 2012.
It's worth noting that of these projects under construction, all but 98 megawatts benefit from long-term power purchase agreements and are expected to deliver meaningful earnings in 2012 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to development, but before I do, I'd like to caveat my comments in light of what has happened to the equity markets, as well as AES stock for the past few days. As we've explained before, we're constantly thinking about how to best allocate capital amongst the various option. There has been to pay down debt, invest in growth opportunities or buy back stock. Our objective is to allocate money to those uses that accrete the most value on a per share basis. Given that our stock closed yesterday at $10.75, buybacks are at the levels that are obviously very attractive. One of the benefits of our current position is that we do have the ability to base a portion of our growth pipeline and to defer certain investments creating possibility to repurchase shares when the prices fall to absurdly low levels as they did yesterday. Of course, we will do this while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet our committed funding obligations such as the acquisition of DPL. 
So with that context, let me turn to our development pipeline and some of the opportunities we have to invest that will deliver growth beyond 2012 and those areas that we identified as areas of strategic focus.  Looking at Southeast Asia, we entered into nonrecourse financing agreements for our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant Mong Duong in Vietnam. As a reminder, this is a $1.95 billion project, and we have $1.46 billion of debt committed, as well as equity from our partners leaving us with a $235 million commitment approximately. Funding out of these agreements is subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent, but we expect construction to begin in the next few months and commercial operations for both units be completed in 2015.
In Turkey, the government has initiated the privatization process with over 1,000 megawatts of natural gas fired assets for which bids were submitted in the end of July. Although we passed on this as we're more interested in the group of lignite coal fire projects of 600 megawatts coming up for bid around year-end, we take the initiation of this first wave of sales as a good sign. Ultimately, the privatization process is anticipated to put 16,000 megawatts of generation capacity on the market. 
Now turning to our wind pipeline, in Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. Last quarter we reached financial close at start of construction on 30 megawatts in the U.K. and could close another 36 megawatts by year-end. We have a pipeline of over 1,000 megawatts in Europe and expect we could put another 175 megawatts into construction with attractive returns by the end of 2012, subject of course to whether these will be more attractive than stock buybacks. 
In the U.S. our pending acquisition of DPLs continues to make progress. Regarding financing for DPL, from our previously stated planned in the second quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion in AES recourse debt to 2 separate transactions. We moved quickly to access strong high-yield markets carrying pricing and terms consistent with our expectations. Subject to market and other conditions we anticipate raising the remaining $1.25 billion of nonrecourse debt at the DPL holding company levels sometime in late third quarter or early fourth quarter. 
In the regulatory approval front in June, we received early termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period. This is the first of 3 significant regulatory hurdles. The next 2 are FERC and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio or PUCO. With respect to the PUCO approval, the staff and public comment period ended in July 18, and we will begin filing our response by August 18. At that time, the PUCO will set the schedule for the remainder of the approval process. 
And finally DPL received SEC approval to distribute its proxy statement with DPL shareholder vote on the merger is scheduled for September 23.  I'd say overall, we're pleased with the progress to date. We still expect to close the deal sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator, Crissa, who will open up the call for your question. Crissa, you want open up the line for questions from the investors?"

What we've seen though just generically is if you look at any of those business, particularly renewable space, there's very little value being given to development and yet high values being given to the operating assets. So if we were to look at something like is, it could also take the shape of us thinking about divesting some of the operating assets and getting some low-cost capital there.

I think we could be paying a dividend. I think as we get to 2013, we probably are generating enough cash where we can be investing in new projects, paying a dividends. And I think when we couple that with asset sales as we move out the markets, start the focus markets, that will even give us greater capacity, making growth investments and basically trading out of assets and selling to people who have or yield requirements that reinvesting it at higher returns.

Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the second quarter of 2011. After Victoria reviews the second quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on several of our other significant projects under construction, as well as our progress on the development pipeline. 
In the second quarter, we achieved the growth versus the first quarter we were expecting, putting us on a trajectory to hit our full year guidance. Excluding costs associated with our pending DPL acquisition, we earned $0.32 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $181 million. Year-to-date, we have earned $0.54 of adjusted EPS, which is approximately 50% of the midpoint of our full year guidance of $1.08 to $1.14 prior to the impact of DPL. This strong quarter was driven by volume growth in Chile, from both existing plants, as well as contributions from Unit 1 at our new coal-fired plant in the northern grid, Angamos, which came online in April. 
Of course, as we indicated last quarter, we did see unfavorable year-over-year trends at our generation businesses in the Philippines and Hungary. Also, our previously disclosed repair efforts in Panama, where we had a partial total collapse in one of our hydroelectric plants, continued to impact both earnings and free cash flow. These negative impacts were anticipated, however, and the repairs to the tunnel for our Panama hydro plant will be completed during the second half of 2012. Thus, we remain on track to achieve our 2011 guidance. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Victoria who will discuss the results for the quarter and update you on our cost-cutting program, which, as we mentioned during our Investor Day, will be one of our key drivers of earnings growth in addition to bringing our construction pipeline in its operation. Victoria?"
35312,138847291,153324,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well a",1571,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well as our account liquidity status. Finally, I'll provide an update on our efficiency efforts today.
First, our key operating drivers. Foreign exchange rates largely moved in our favor during the quarter. As a reminder, many of our businesses operate in currencies other than the dollar and, therefore, benefit when those currencies appreciate relative to the dollar. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, the Brazilian real and the euro both appreciated by almost 13%, while the Philippine peso rose approximately 5%. As a result, favorable foreign exchange contributed to improved earnings. 
Likewise, volume was favorable at most -- as most growth trends in Latin America continued. Our Brazilian utilities had growth of 3%, while our generation businesses in Argentina and Chile had volume growth of 7% and 26% respectively. In Asia and Europe, the volume trends were consistent with our expectations. You may recall that our generation businesses in the Philippines, Masinloc, benefited from higher-than-expected demand growth of 10% last year, which, coupled with low availability at competitors' base load plants, benefited us with very favorable spot prices. This year, by comparison, lower demand driven by relatively cooler weather and better system availability did not provide the same favorability. In Europe, our merchant generation business at Hungary also felt the impact of lower volume due to lower demand. 
In addition, we've seen challenging pricing in certain markets where we are no longer benefiting from long-term contract pricing. I've mentioned on past calls that the PPA at Kilroot in Northern Ireland came to the end of its term in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since then, we've been operating under less favorable merchant prices. In addition, annual tariff adjustments in Brazil have suppressed the earnings of our utilities there. 
Beyond these base business drivers in the second quarter, we began to realize the material contribution from 2 of our major projects coming online this year. At our Maritza plant in Bulgaria, revenue generated from the partial COD achieved in June helped gross margin. At Angamos in Chile, the early COD of Unit 1 also contributed incrementally for the first time this year. Together, these 2 businesses had a positive impact on proportional gross margin of over $30 million relative to the second quarter of 2010 and relative to the first quarter of 2011.
A significant offset to these positive trends was the previously disclosed outage at Estí, our hydroelectric plant in Panama. A partial tunnel collapse in late 2010 and the subsequent repair work has exposed the plant to very high spot pricing as it purchased power to satisfy its contractual obligations. Receipt of insurance proceeds covering both the repair and the business interruption are anticipated in the second half of this year. The plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. 
All of these key drivers contributed to a second quarter consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $17 million or 2% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $619 million of gross margin, an increase of 4% relative to 2010. You'll note that this increase in gross margin of 2% is well below the rate of increase in revenue, which accelerated by 16%. I'd like to take a moment to provide some context for this dynamic. 
Revenue increased at a higher rate than gross margin, partially as a result of the pass-through of fuel costs and purchase energy, which increased revenue but did not have a corresponding impact on gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by the forced outage in Panama due to the tunnel work there. In addition, there was some onetime charges, such as regulatory penalties at Sul in Brazil and a bad debt reversal at Gener in Chile in 2010. 
In some cases, these higher fixed cost are compensated for in the tariff process, meaning we'll see offsetting benefits in future billing periods. Examples of this include higher people costs in Ukraine and contract services relative to demand management systems at IPL. That said, managing fixed costs is a top priority for management, and through the initiatives we outlined previously, we expect to reverse this trend wherever possible.
In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.32, excluding $0.04 of costs related to the pending DPL acquisition. This represents an increase of $0.08 from the second quarter of 2010. In addition to the gross margin drivers I've just reviewed, we continue to benefit from an implied effective tax rate, due to the renewal of TIPRA, a U.S. tax law, in the fourth quarter of 2010, which impacts distribution from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.24, an increase of $0.05 from second quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also affected by an increase of $0.07 in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010. These noncash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010. This is partially offset by the $0.04 loss from the impairment of Kelanitissa, our generation business in Sri Lanka. 
Now let's discuss cash flow. The cash flow results reflect some of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, we saw growth in operating cash flow from Latin America, which was offset by declines in Asia and North America. Although our Eastern Energy businesses in New York are now accounted for in discontinued operations, as we work through this terms of their sale, they will still negatively effect consolidated cash flow. Additionally, Eastern was negatively impacted year-over-year by the expiration of hedges, which we benefited from in 2010. In addition, we lost the contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar subsequent to their sale in 2010. 
As a result, our operating cash flow of $675 million was $72 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $72 million to $294 million on a proportional basis. Consolidated free cash flow decreased by $128 million to $460 million for the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx,  primarily at utilities in North America and Cameroon. It's important to note that we expect the free cash flow trend at Panama to improve in the second half by the receipt of the insurance proceeds. On a proportional basis our free cash flow decreased $101 million to $148 million. 
Now turning to parent company liquidity. During the quarter, parent company liquidity benefited from the $2 billion debt offerings we completed, which are earmarked to fund the acquisition of DPL at close. In addition, we received $167 million from subsidiary distributions, net of corporate overhead and cash interest expense, during the quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we retired $200 million of senior secured term loan due in August. Additionally, we spent $145 million for several construction and development projects such, as Maritza in Bulgaria, Laurel Mountain in the U.S., Mong Duong, our coal project in Vietnam, and completed our partnership with Koç in Turkey, in advance of the privatization there. Finally, we repurchased approximately $36 million of shares during the quarter.
Including the proceeds of the DPL acquisition financing, our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $3.1 billion, up $1.8 billion versus the first quarter of 2011. Without the DPL infusion, liquidity would be $1.1 billion, a decrease of $200 million versus the first quarter of 2011. 
I'd like to take a moment now to update you on our overhead transformation program. Back in May, at our Investor Conference, I introduced AES's transformation program to improve cost effectiveness and efficiencies across AES. We expect this initiative to yield $100 million in run rate savings by the end of 2014. 
During the second quarter, we gained momentum on these initiatives, including outsourcing high-volume financial transaction processes, such as accounts payable and general accounting. We expect to implement outsourcing in Asia and portions of Europe by year-end. In addition, we are on the beginning stages of enhancing and expanding our utilization of financial systems. This provides flexibility to meet multiple recording -- reporting needs, streamlining data collection and increasing automation. In summary, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.08 to $1.14, excluding DPL acquisition costs. I would note, excluding DPL costs, we're turning toward the higher end of this range of earnings. That said, our estimates for the DPL acquisition costs may move up to a $0.13 relative to the $0.11 previously discussed due to additional interest costs in 2011. 
Given the projected trends and interest rates, we decided to access the capital markets early to lock in long-term financing attractive rates consistent with our assumptions. In total, this leaves us squarely within the range of our adjusted EPS guidance, inclusive of DPL costs, of $0.97 to $1.03.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who'll provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline."
35312,138847291,153324,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Victoria. Before I give an update on the construction development projects, I'd like to take a moment and review the recent announcement of the proposed sale of our telecom business in Brazil.

Before I give an update on the construction development projects, I'd like to take a moment and review the recent announcement of the proposed sale of our telecom business in Brazil. 
Yes, I think the sale is a good example of how we think about portfolio management and how it can add value to the company. In early July, our Brazilian affiliate, Brasiliana, entered into an agreement to sell 2 telecommunication businesses for BRL 1.6 billion or approximately USD $1 billion. A portion of the proceeds will accrue to the shareholders of Eletropaulo, with remainder flowing to Brasiliana of which we own approximately 46%. Although a final decision has not been made, one possible use of these proceeds would be to pay down some very expensive debt at Brasiliana, which carries a 14% interest rate. For our share of Brasiliana, we anticipate recording a onetime gain in excess of $200 million on the transaction in 2011, and on an ongoing basis, we expect it to be accretive to our earnings beginning in 2012 due to reduction of debt. 
Now let me turn to our construction program. We continue to make good progress during the second quarter, with approximately 950 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. On June 3, our 670-megawatt Maritza coal-fired power plant from Bulgaria was placed into commercial operation at an initial capacity of 494 megawatts on a gross megawatt basis. As of July 21, the capacity has been tested at 630 megawatts, in line with our plan to reach design capacity of 670 megawatts gross by year-end.
In addition, as you may recall, we terminated contractor for the Maritza project, Alstom, on March 21. We had also requested payment for the performance security posted by the contractor, and on July 6, we received a positive ruling from the court of Versailles, and therefore -- thereafter, received payment of the full amount of demands made under the performance security in the amount of approximately €155 million. 
Now turning to Latin America. We continue to make good progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518-megawatt Angamos coal-fired plant in northern Chile has fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule. More importantly for the bottom line, Unit 1 achieved a 12% higher output and 6% better efficiency than was guaranteed by the EPC contract. Yet, it, too, has reached full load operation and is on schedule to reach its commercial operation date by the middle of September, which is ahead of its scheduled completion date. 
During the second quarter, we also continued making progress with the Changuinola hydro project in Panama, filling the reservoir for 223-megawatt hydro project start and starting early commissioning activities. Our current forecast is to have the first hydro unit in operation in mid-September and the second unit in operation by October. Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, also continued progressing well towards it scheduled completion in early 2013. In addition, we have 262 megawatts of wind generation capacity in the United states, China, Europe and India under construction and targeted for completion by the end of 2011. 
Finally, AES Solar continues to successfully develop and construct projects. We have 127 megawatts in operation, 31 megawatts under construction and expect another 118 to enter construction by the end of the year. Including the 32 megawatts that came online during the quarter, this will bring the total megawatts online to 277 megawatts by the end of 2012. It's worth noting that of these projects under construction, all but 98 megawatts benefit from long-term power purchase agreements and are expected to deliver meaningful earnings in 2012 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to development. But before I do, I'd like to caveat my comments in light of what has happened to the equity markets, as well as AES stock over the past few days. As we've explained before, we're constantly thinking about how to best allocate capital amongst the various options. Those being to pay down debt, invest in growth opportunities or buy back stock. Our objective is to allocate money to those uses that accrete the most value on a per-share basis. And given where our stock closed yesterday at $10.75, buybacks are, at the level, obviously very attractive. 
One of the benefits of our current position is that we do have the ability to pace a portion of our growth pipeline and to defer certain investments, creating flexibility to repurchase shares when the prices fall to absurdly low levels as they did yesterday. Of course, we will do this while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet our committed funding obligations, such as the acquisition of DPL. 
So with that context, let me turn to our development pipeline and some of the opportunities we have to invest that will deliver growth beyond 2012 and those areas that we identified as areas of strategic focus.  Looking at Southeast Asia, we entered into nonrecourse financing agreements for our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant Mong Duong in Vietnam. As a reminder, this is a $1.95-billion project, and we have $1.46 billion of debt committed, as well as equity from our partners, leaving us with a $235-million commitment approximately. Funding of these agreements is subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent, but we expect construction to begin in the next few months and commercial operations for both units to be completed in 2015.
In Turkey, the government has initiated the privatization process with over 1,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired assets for which bids were submitted at the end of July. Although we passed on this round as we were more interested in the group of lignite coal-fired projects of 600 megawatts coming up for bid around year-end, we take the initiation of this first wave of sales as a good sign. Ultimately, the privatization process is anticipated to put 16,000 megawatts of generation capacity on the market. 
Now turning to our Wind pipeline. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. Last quarter, we reached financial close and started construction on 30 megawatts in the U.K. and could close another 36 megawatts by year-end. We have a pipeline of over 1,000 megawatts in Europe and expect that we could put another 175 megawatts into construction with attractive returns, by the end of 2012, subject, of course, to whether these will be more attractive than stock buybacks. 
In the U.S., our pending acquisition of DPLs continues to make progress. Regarding financing for DPL, per our previously stated plan, in the second quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion in AES recourse debt to 2 separate transactions. We moved quickly to access strong high-yield markets, carrying pricing and terms consistent with our expectations. Subject to market and other conditions, we anticipate raising the remaining $1.25 billion of nonrecourse debt at the DPL holding company level, sometime in late third quarter or early fourth quarter. 
On the regulatory approval front, in June, we received early termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period. This is the first of 3 significant regulatory hurdles. The next 2 are FERC and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio or PUCO. With respect to the PUCO approval, the staff and public comment period ended on July 18, and we will begin filing our response by August 18. At that time, the PUCO will set the schedule for the remainder of the approval process. And finally, DPL received SEC approval to distribute its proxy statement. The DPL shareholder vote on the merger is scheduled for September 23. I'd say overall, we're pleased with the progress to date. We still expect to close the deal sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2012.

So we'll continue to look at all those options, but it's really going to come from -- I mean, there's no need to divest those. We think they're good businesses. But to the extent that there's strong interest and we can get good value for the businesses, we'd take a look at that. I'd say, what we've seen though, just generically, is if you look at any of those business, particularly renewable space, very little value being given to development, but yet high value is being given to the operating assets. So if we were to look at something like this, it could also take the shape of us thinking about divesting some of the operating assets and getting some low-cost capital there. In many cases, we're talking about people have expectations of single-digit rates return, and we keep the development and continue to move those forward, because that's really -- if we can be investing at routine returns and then selling them down at single-digit returns, that's not a bad business for us."

And I think we'll keep talking about that. But the one thing we do sense is that the investors today currently value yield, and we have a -- we have some very high yielding assets. And we just try to think about how we take advantage of that. But clearly, a number of our investors have been pushing very hard for dividend. I think we could be paying a dividend. I think as we get to 2013, we probably are generating enough cash where we can be investing in new projects, paying a dividends. I think when we couple that with asset sales as we move out of markets that aren't the focus markets, that will even give us greater capacity to be making growth investments and basically trading out of assets with -- and selling to people who have lower yield requirements, then reinvesting it at higher returns. So I think we'll be talking about that a lot more next year, but you shouldn't expect anything, clearly not this year and probably not next year.

Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the second quarter of 2011. After Victoria reviews the second quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on several of our other significant projects",309,"Thanks, Joel, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance during the second quarter of 2011. After Victoria reviews the second quarter results in more detail, I'll give an update on several of our other significant projects under construction, as well as our progress on the development pipeline. 
In the second quarter, we achieved the growth versus the first quarter we were expecting, putting us on a trajectory to hit our full year guidance. Excluding costs associated with our pending DPL acquisition, we earned $0.32 of adjusted EPS during the quarter and proportional free cash flow of $181 million. Year-to-date, we have earned $0.54 of adjusted EPS, which is approximately 50% of the midpoint of our full year guidance of $1.08 to $1.14 prior to the impact of DPL. This strong quarter was driven by volume growth in Chile, from both existing plants, as well as contributions from Unit 1 at our new coal-fired plant in the northern grid, Angamos, which came online in April. 
Of course, as we indicated last quarter, we did see unfavorable year-over-year trends at our generation businesses in the Philippines and Hungary. Also, our previously disclosed repair efforts in Panama, where we had a partial total collapse in one of our hydroelectric plants, continued to impact both earnings and free cash flow. These negative impacts were anticipated, however, and the repairs to the tunnel for our Panama hydro plant will be completed during the second half of 2012. Thus, we remain on track to achieve our 2011 guidance. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Victoria, who will discuss the results for the quarter and update you on our cost-cutting program, which, as we mentioned during our Investor Day, will be one of our key drivers of earnings growth in addition to bringing our construction pipeline into operation. Victoria?"
35312,138847291,153395,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well a",1573,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter. Then I'll walk through our gross margin, EPS and cash flow results, as well as our parent liquidity status. Finally, I'll provide an update on our efficiency efforts today.
First, our key operating drivers. Foreign exchange rates largely moved in our favor during the quarter. As a reminder, many of our businesses operate in currencies other than the dollar and, therefore, benefit when those currencies appreciate relative to the dollar. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, the Brazilian real and the euro both appreciated by almost 13%, while the Philippine peso rose approximately 5%. As a result, favorable foreign exchange contributed to improved earnings. 
Likewise, volume was favorable at most -- as most growth trends in Latin America continued. Our Brazilian utilities had growth of 3%, while our generation businesses in Argentina and Chile had volume growth of 7% and 26% respectively. In Asia and Europe, the volume trends were consistent with our expectations. You may recall that our generation businesses in the Philippines, Masinloc, benefited from higher-than-expected demand growth of 10% last year, which, coupled with low availability at competitors' base load plants, benefited us with very favorable spot prices. This year, by comparison, lower demand driven by relatively cooler weather and better system availability did not provide the same favorability. In Europe, our merchant generation business in Hungary also felt the impact of lower volume due to lower market demand. 
In addition, we've seen challenging pricing in certain markets where we are no longer benefiting from long-term contract pricing. I've mentioned on past calls that the PPA at Kilroot in Northern Ireland came to the end of its term in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since then, we've been operating under less favorable merchant prices. In addition, annual tariff adjustments in Brazil have suppressed the earnings of our utilities there. 
Beyond these base business drivers in the second quarter, we began to realize the material contribution from 2 of our major projects coming online this year. At our Maritza plant in Bulgaria, revenue generated from the partial COD achieved in June helped gross margin. At Angamos in Chile, the early COD of Unit 1 also contributed incrementally for the first time this year. Together, these 2 businesses had a positive impact on proportional gross margin of over $30 million relative to the second quarter of 2010 and relative to the first quarter of 2011.
A significant offset to these positive trends was the previously disclosed outage at Estí, our hydroelectric plant in Panama. A partial tunnel collapse in late 2010 and the subsequent repair work has exposed the plant to very high spot pricing as it must purchase power to satisfy its contractual obligations. Receipt of insurance proceeds covering both the repair and the business interruption are anticipated in the second half of this year. The plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. 
All of these key drivers contributed to a second quarter consolidated gross margin of just over $1 billion, an increase of $17 million or 2% compared to 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $619 million of gross margin, an increase of 4% relative to 2010. You'll note that this increase in gross margin of 2% is well below the rate of increase in revenue, which accelerated by 16%. I'd like to take a moment to provide some context for this dynamic. 
Revenue increased at a higher rate than gross margin, partially as a result of the pass-through of fuel costs and purchase energy, which increased revenue but did not have a corresponding impact on gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by the forced outage in Panama due to the tunnel work there. In addition, there was some onetime charges, such as regulatory penalties at Sul in Brazil and a bad debt reversal at Gener in Chile in 2010. 
In some cases, these higher fixed cost are compensated for in the tariff process, meaning we'll see offsetting benefits in future billing periods. Examples of this include higher people costs in Ukraine and contract services relative to demand management systems at IPL. That said, managing fixed costs is a top priority for management, and through the initiatives we outlined previously, we expect to reverse this trend wherever possible.
In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.32, excluding $0.04 of costs related to the pending DPL acquisition. This represents an increase of $0.08 from the second quarter of 2010. In addition to the gross margin drivers I've just reviewed, we continue to benefit from an implied effective tax rate, due to the renewal of TIPRA, a U.S. tax law, in the fourth quarter of 2010, which impacts distribution from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.24, an increase of $0.05 from second quarter of 2010. In addition to the factors I just described for adjusted EPS, diluted EPS was also affected by an increase of $0.07 in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010. These noncash gains are primarily due to an increase in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances, given the strengthening of the euro and British pound since the end of 2010. This is partially offset by the $0.04 loss from the impairment of Kelanitissa, our generation business in Sri Lanka. 
Now let's discuss cash flow. The cash flow results reflect some of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, we saw growth in operating cash flow from Latin America, which was offset by declines in Asia and North America. Although our Eastern Energy businesses in New York are now accounted for in discontinued operations, as we work through this terms of their sale, they will still negatively affect consolidated cash flow. Additionally, Eastern was negatively impacted year-over-year by the expiration of hedges, which we benefited from in 2010. In addition, we lost the contributions from the businesses in Oman, Pakistan and Qatar subsequent to their sale in 2010. 
As a result, our operating cash flow of $675 million was $72 million lower year-over-year on a consolidated basis and lower by $72 million to $294 million on a proportional basis. Consolidated free cash flow decreased by $128 million to $460 million for the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower operating cash flow, as well as higher maintenance CapEx, primarily at its utilities in North America and Cameroon. It's important to note that we expect the free cash flow trend at Panama to improve in the second half by the receipt of the insurance proceeds. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased $101 million to $148 million. 
Now turning to parent company liquidity. During the quarter, parent company liquidity benefited from the $2 billion debt offerings we completed, which are earmarked to fund the acquisition of DPL at close. In addition, we received $167 million from subsidiary distributions, net of corporate overhead and cash interest expense, during the quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we retired $200 million of senior secured term loan due in August. Additionally, we spent $145 million for several construction and development projects, such as Maritza in Bulgaria, Laurel Mountain in the U.S., Mong Duong, our coal project in Vietnam, and completed our partnership with Koç in Turkey, in advance of the privatization there. Finally, we repurchased approximately $36 million of shares during the quarter.
Including the proceeds of the DPL acquisition financing, our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $3.1 billion, up $1.8 billion versus the first quarter of 2011. Without the DPL infusion, liquidity would be $1.1 billion, a decrease of $200 million versus the first quarter of 2011. 
I'd like to take a moment now to update you on our overhead transformation program. Back in May, at our Investor Conference, I introduced AES's transformation program to improve cost effectiveness and efficiencies across AES. We expect this initiative to yield $100 million in run rate savings by the end of 2014. 
During the second quarter, we gained momentum on these initiatives, including outsourcing high-volume financial transaction processes, such as accounts payable and general accounting. We expect to implement outsourcing in Asia and portions of Europe by year-end. In addition, we are in the beginning stages of enhancing and expanding our utilization of financial systems. This provides flexibility to meet multiple recording -- reporting needs, streamlining data collection and increasing automation. In summary, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.08 to $1.14, excluding DPL acquisition costs. I would note, excluding DPL costs, we're turning toward the higher end of this range of earnings. That said, our estimates for the DPL acquisition costs may move up to a $0.13 relative to the $0.11 previously discussed due to additional interest costs in 2011. 
Given projected trends and interest rates, we decided to access the capital markets early to lock in long-term financing attractive rates consistent with our assumptions. In total, this leaves us squarely within the range of our adjusted EPS guidance, inclusive of DPL costs, of $0.97 to $1.03.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul who'll provide an update on our construction projects and development pipeline."
35312,138847291,153395,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Victoria. Before I give an update on the construction development projects, I'd like to take a moment and review the recent announcement of the proposed sale of our telecom business in Brazil. Yes, I think the sale is a good example of how",1328,"Okay. Thanks, Victoria. Before I give an update on the construction development projects, I'd like to take a moment and review the recent announcement of the proposed sale of our telecom business in Brazil. 
Yes, I think the sale is a good example of how we think about portfolio management and how it can add value to the company. In early July, our Brazilian affiliate, Brasiliana, entered into an agreement to sell 2 telecommunication businesses for BRL 1.6 billion or approximately USD $1 billion. A portion of the proceeds will accrue to the shareholders of Eletropaulo, with remainder flowing to Brasiliana of which we own approximately 46%. Although a final decision has not been made, one possible use of these proceeds would be to pay down some very expensive debt at Brasiliana, which carries a 14% interest rate. For our share of Brasiliana, we anticipate recording a onetime gain in excess of $200 million on the transaction in 2011, and on an ongoing basis, we expect it to be accretive to our earnings beginning in 2012 due to the reduction of debt. 
Now let me turn to our construction program. We continued to make good progress during the second quarter, with approximately 950 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2011. On June 3, our 670-megawatt Maritza coal-fired power plant in Bulgaria was placed into commercial operation at an initial capacity of 494 megawatts on a gross megawatt basis. As of July 21, the capacity has been tested at 630 megawatts, in line with our plan to reach design capacity of 670 megawatts gross by year-end.
In addition, as you may recall, we terminated the contractor for the Maritza project, Alstom, on March 21. We had also requested payment for the performance security posted by the contractor, and on July 6, we received a positive ruling from the court of Versailles, and therefore -- thereafter, received payment of the full amount of demands made under the performance security in the amount of approximately EUR 155 million. 
Now turning to Latin America. We continue to make good progress towards our schedule to commission approximately 720 megawatts of capacity in 2011. Our 518-megawatt Angamos coal-fired plant in Northern Chile has fully commissioned Unit 1 ahead of schedule. More importantly for the bottom line, Unit 1 achieved a 12% higher output and 6% better efficiency than was guaranteed by the EPC contract. Yet, it, too, has reached full load operation and is on schedule to reach its commercial operation date by the middle of September, which is ahead of its scheduled completion date. 
During the second quarter, we also continued making progress with the Changuinola hydro project in Panama, filling the reservoir for 223-megawatt hydro project start and starting early commissioning activities. Our current forecast is to have the first hydro unit in operation in mid-September and the second unit in operation by October. Campiche, our 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Chile, also continued progressing well towards its scheduled completion in early 2013. In addition, we have 262 megawatts of wind generation capacity in the United states, China, Europe and India under construction and targeted for completion by the end of 2011. 
Finally, AES Solar continues to successfully develop and construct projects. We have 127 megawatts in operation, 31 megawatts under construction and expect another 118 to enter construction by the end of the year. Including the 32 megawatts that came online during the quarter, this will bring the total megawatts online to 277 megawatts by the end of 2012. It's worth noting that of these projects under construction, all but 98 megawatts benefit from long-term power purchase agreements and are expected to deliver meaningful earnings in 2012 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to development. But before I do, I'd like to caveat my comments in light of what has happened to the equity markets, as well as AES stock over the past few days. As we've explained before, we're constantly thinking about how to best allocate capital amongst the various options. Those being to pay down debt, invest in growth opportunities or buy back stock. Our objective is to allocate money to those uses that accrete the most value on a per-share basis. And given where our stock closed yesterday at $10.75, buybacks are, at that level, are obviously very attractive. 
One of the benefits of our current position is that we do have the ability to pace a portion of our growth pipeline and to defer certain investments, creating flexibility to repurchase shares when the prices fall to absurdly low levels as they did yesterday. Of course, we will do this while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet our committed funding obligations, such as the acquisition of DPL. 
So with that context, let me turn to our development pipeline and some of the opportunities that we have to invest that will deliver growth beyond 2012 and those areas that we identified as areas of strategic focus.  Looking at Southeast Asia, we entered into non-recourse financing agreements for our 1,200-megawatt greenfield coal plant Mong Duong in Vietnam. As a reminder, this is a $1.95-billion project, and we have $1.46 billion of debt committed, as well as equity from our partners, leaving us with a $235-million commitment approximately. Funding of these agreements is subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent, but we expect construction to begin in the next few months and commercial operations for both units to be completed in 2015.
In Turkey, the government has initiated the privatization process with over 1,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired assets for which bids were submitted at the end of July. Although we passed on this round as we were more interested in the group of lignite coal-fired projects of 600 megawatts coming up for bid around year-end, we take the initiation of this first wave of sales as a good sign. Ultimately, the privatization process is anticipated to put 16,000 megawatts of generation capacity on the market. 
Now turning to our Wind pipeline. In Europe, we continue to pursue renewable energy projects. Last quarter, we reached financial close and started construction on 30 megawatts in the U.K. and could close another 36 megawatts by year-end. We have a pipeline of over 1,000 megawatts in Europe and expect that we could put another 175 megawatts into construction with attractive returns, by the end of 2012, subject, of course, to whether these will be more attractive than stock buybacks. 
In the U.S., our pending acquisition of DPLs continues to make progress. Regarding financing for DPL, per our previously stated plan, in the second quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion in AES recourse debt through 2 separate transactions. We moved quickly to access strong high-yield markets, carrying pricing and terms consistent with our expectations. Subject to market and other conditions, we anticipate raising the remaining $1.25 billion of non-recourse debt at the DPL holding company level, sometime in late third quarter or early fourth quarter. 
On the regulatory approval front, in June, we received early termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period. This is the first of 3 significant regulatory hurdles. The next 2 are FERC and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio or PUCO. With respect to the PUCO approval, the staff and public comment period ended on July 18, and we will begin filing our response by August 18. At that time, the PUCO will set the schedule for the remainder of the approval process. And finally, DPL received SEC approval to distribute its proxy statement. The DPL shareholder vote on the merger is scheduled for September 23. I'd say overall, we're pleased with the progress to date. We still expect to close the deal sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2012.

So if we were to look at something like this, it could also take the shape of us thinking about divesting some of the operating assets and getting some low-cost capital there. In many cases, we're talking about people have expectations of single-digit rates return, and we keep the development and continue to move those forward, because that's really -- if we can be investing at routine returns and then selling them down at single-digit returns, that's not a bad business for us."

And we're just trying to think about well, how do we take advantage of that. But clearly, a number of our investors have been pushing very hard for dividend. I think we could be paying a dividend. I think as we get to 2013, we probably are generating enough cash where we can be investing in new projects, paying a dividends. I think when we couple that with asset sales as we move out of the markets that aren't the focus markets, that will even give us greater capacity to be making growth investments and basically trading out of assets with -- and selling them to people who have lower yield requirements, then reinvesting it at higher returns. So I think we'll be talking about that a lot more next year, but you shouldn't expect anything, clearly not this year and probably not next year.

35312,141270167,185036,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as SEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio mana",1186,"Good morning, everyone, and thank for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as SEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio management. Second is the acceleration of our previously announced cost savings program; and third is our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We are on track to meet our 2011 guidance, and we believe that the steps that we are taking, such as accelerating cost savings, completing more than 1,500 megawatts of construction and closing the acquisition of DNL, support strong earnings growth in 2012. Building on this seems from our May Investor Day, we're working to become a geographically focused and cost-efficient company with an improving credit profile.
By paying a consistent quarterly dividend and growing our established business platforms, we believe we will be positioned to deliver compelling total shareholder returns. Starting with the first announcement. Our portfolio management plan aims to improve overall returns by selling noncore assets and focusing our investments in fewer markets, where we have a competitive advantage.
As a reminder, our 3 core markets are the United States, Brazil and Chile. We also have important investment pipelines and projects under construction in Turkey, Poland, United Kingdom and Vietnam. There are markets, however, such as Spain and China, where we do not believe we can achieve the necessary scale or any competitive advantage that would support realizing the level of returns that we expect from our businesses. We plan to decrease our presence in such markets in a prudent and consistent manner.
With regard to recent portfolio management activities, we have achieved 2 important milestones. The first was the to sign an agreement with the GDF Suez for combined cycle plant in Spain. Under the agreement, the GDF Suez, who's also the plant's uptake and gas supplier, will buy 80% of our interest in the plant for EUR 172 million, with an option to buy the remainder for an additional EUR 28 million in 2013.
Secondly, Braziliana, our joint venture with BNDES the Brazilian National Development Bank, received payment of $901 million this week for our telecom businesses in São Paulo and Rio. Of the net proceeds of $618 million, Brazilians plans to use $480 million to retire very expensive debt, tearing an interest rate of 14.2% in reais. Besides improving earnings, this will further strengthen cash flows to AES by eliminating a large debt at a Holding Company.
In both all these cases, what ago message of attractive opportunities to simplify our portfolio by getting out of mor materially reducing our presence in noncore markets and businesses. Well, far or less material to our results at the met with our portfolio management objectives, we also sold us all operations in the Czech Republic and have exit this market. During our Investor Day presentation in May of this year, the company set up a goal of reducing annual overhead costs by $100 million by the end of 2014.
We initially set a target of achieving annualized savings of $10 million to $20 million for 2012. We have since decided to accelerate this program and have already taken steps that will increase our savings for the next year to arrange a $40 million to $50 million. We expect to reach the target of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2013, a year earlier than our initial 2014 targeted.
Our cost savings for 2012 are mainly comprised of personnel reductions and third-party expenses related to business development in noncore markets, as well as reductions in our corporate support functions, flowing from a recently announced mad management structure. The new structure has 2 chief operating officers. Andy BC will run the utilities group and Ned Hall will head our generation group. Victoria Harker will assume additional responsibilities by leading and risk and Global Business Services, comprised of information technology and non-fuel sourcing.
These changes will help us reduce cost by eliminating reporting layers and making better use of our global synergies in Ohio. At the same time, we will maintain our disciplined capital allocation process and level of financial controls.
All of these actions are being made in line with our strategy of focusing on our core and key growing markets, where we have or will have a sustainable competitive advantage. These reductions in business development expenses will not affect our ability to grow, either in the short term or long term, as we have plenty of remaining development projects and acquisition opportunities in our pipeline.
Regarding our third announcement. We intend to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of 2012 of $120 million annually, payable on equal quarterly installments, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. At today's shared price, this represents a dividend of about 1.3% of our market cap. This timing will allow us to start realizing the benefits of the acquisition of DPL and the commercial operations of new projects coming online this year.
At the same time, we wanted to provide investors with as much transparency as possible regarding our future plans, and that is why we're announcing it today. Of course, we will consider increasing the dividend over time subject to our operational performance, credit profile and external market factors. A dividend will represent an important commitment to return cash to shareholders on a timely basis, as well as a demonstration of our confidence in future cash flows.
Speaking of returning money to our shareholders, during the third quarter, we took advantage of market volatility by repurchasing $126 million worth of shares. We repurchased an additional $54 million in October, bringing our total repurchases since July of 2010 to $378 million. 
Before turning the call over to Victoria, I would like to give you a brief update on our construction program and the acquisition of DPL. During the third quarter, Maritza, our 670-megawatt late-night fire plant in Bulgaria, passed it 72-hour full capacity operational test, meaning that as anticipated, it will produce earnings of approximately $0.11 next year. Our 223-megawatt hydro plant in Panama and our 518-megawatt coal-fired plant Angamos in Chile have also achieved full commission. With these 3 additional plans, and our 98-megawatts Laurel Mountain wind project in BJM, we've completed more than 1,500 megawatts of new construction slated for this year.
The acquisition of DPL is proceeding smoothly, DPL recently obtain approval from the shareholders. And with all funding in place, we're only weren't waiting for approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and FERC. As you know, DP&L will be a major earnings and cash contributor in 2012 and will allow us to accelerate the use of substantial tax attributes available at AES. Plant activities are on track to fully integrate DP&L into the AES family of companies by early next year.
Now Victoria will walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, as well as expectations for full year 2011 and guidance for 2012."
35312,141270167,185036,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter, then I'll walk through our other key financial metrics, as well as liquidity",1458,"Thanks, Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter, then I'll walk through our other key financial metrics, as well as liquidity. First, our operating drivers.
Volume trends in Latin America this quarter continued to show growth year-on-year. Our Brazilian utilities grew by 4%, driven by increased demand. Our Latin American Generation business has also benefited from higher volume. Chile experiences demand growth in essential growth of over 3%. Argentina had volume growth of 7%, due to better availability of plants there. Earnings for the period also increased, in part due to our new businesses such as Maritza in Bulgaria, where increased comparison was brought online during the quarter, increasing its contribution both versus the prior year and also the second quarter of 2011.
In addition, Valley, our Northern Ireland business acquired in August 2010, contributed positive year-over-year earnings. These positive trends were partially offset by lower prices at a fewer of our businesses. At one of our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo, the regulated tariff is reviewed and reset every 4 years, but the July 2011 reset has not yet been finalized.
As a result, for the third quarter, Eletropaulo continues to invoice customers under the existing tariff rate, as required by the regulator. However, it is expected that the new tariff, once finalized, will be lower than the existing tariff. Therefore, we also recognized the regulatory liability against a portion of these collected amounts from July 2011 forward.
Likewise, we anticipate a reduction in revenue in 2012 and going forward, once the tariff is inactive. As was true in the second quarter, the, our hydroelectric plant jointly owned with the government in Panama, continue to create a drag on our results for the third quarter versus the same quarter of 2010. The plant remains offline as repair work continues. During that time, it is meeting its contractual obligations through spot market energy purchases. While we did receive business interruption insurance proceeds of $30 million in the third quarter, the net impact is still negative for this quarter.
As a reminder, the plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. Foreign exchange tailwinds experienced earlier in 2011 diminished in the third quarter, and foreign exchange had a minimal impact on our earnings for the period.
However, FX tends to be very volatile as a result of global economic trends. Third quarter consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, which is an increase of $53 million or 5% compared to the same quarter of 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $563 million of gross margin, which was a decline of $25 million versus 2010, primarily due to the impact of the Panama outage.
This quarter, we also booked several impairments to operating assets, as well as directly investments that I'd like to walk you through.
In total, these impairments represented $0.27 per share loss on a GAAP earnings basis. Approximately $0.10 of this was due to the impairment of 39 wind turbines held in storage and the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits made in prior years for the purchase of other wind turbines. An additional $0.12 of impairments was related to our investment in generation businesses in China. As we previously discussed, our business in China has experienced increased pressure on its operating margins due to higher coal prices, which we have not have the ability to pass through in tariffs there.
Finally, we impaired our climate solutions businesses due to a continued decline in the market prices for carbon oxide. Please remember that these noncash expenses impact GAAP EPS from continuing operations, but they're excluded from our adjusted EPS results.
In the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.27, including $0.04 of costs related to the pending DPL acquisition. Excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.31, or an increase of $0.11 over the third quarter of 2010.
While proportional gross margin is down for the third quarter, adjusted EPS benefited from a favorable effective, a tax settlement in the Dominican Republic, as well as lower expenses. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.15, a decrease of $0.20 compared to the third quarter of 2010.  This year-over-year change was driven by unrealized foreign exchange transaction impact, which swung from a $0.13 gain in the third quarter of 2010 to a loss of $0.10 in the third quarter of 2011.
These noncash losses are primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances, as a result of the weakening of the Euro, British pound and Chilean peso during the quarter. Now let's discuss cash flow.
Our cash flow results reflect many of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, operating cash flow grew as a result of favorable working capital at our business in Chile and the contribution of new businesses in Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, which was offset by declines in Eletropaulo, El Salvador and the Philippines, driven by higher regulatory charges and lower operating income respectively.
As a result, our operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was $127 million higher year-over-year on a consolidated basis and higher by $102 million on a proportional basis, driven by new businesses in Europe and improved working capital in Chile. Consolidated free cash flow increased by $55 million to $886 million for the quarter. This increase was driven by higher operating cash flows just discussed, partially offset by higher maintenance CapEx, primarily in our Northern America utilities. This was primarily due to environmental projects there, as well as the seat outage in Panama, as well as the stronger real in Brazil.
On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $55 million to $456 million. Now turning to parent liquidity. During the third quarter, parent liquidity benefited from $344 million of subsidiary distributions net of corporate overhead and interest expense during the quarter.
Also during the quarter, we repurchased $126 million of AES shares as a result of market price opportunities. Additionally, we funded $414 million during the quarter. These investment consisted of prepayment of interest costs associated with DP&L acquisition debt, as well as several construction and development projects, such as Longtom in Vietnam, Laurel Mountain in the U.S. and our AES Solar business.
Our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $2.9 billion, down $200 million versus the second quarter of 2011. In some, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
As you know, full year adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, excluding the DP&L acquisition costs estimated at $0.13. As we look ahead to the conclusion of 2011, we have several transactions underway, which could impact our final results compared to our guidance previously given. The most material of which I'd like to highlight here.
We previously disclosed that we're pursuing a sale of our interest in Eastern Energy. As you recall, in March 2011, we placed Eastern Energy into discontinued operations based on our active sale process this year. Given where we are in the year, and while efforts to sell Eastern Energy continue, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our interest there.
It is possible that Eastern Energy May no longer be classified as continued operations by year end and as a result, we may be required to include Eastern Energy's loss of $0.07 per share in the company's results of operations in 2011.
As previously referenced, we also have several other transactions ongoing, which could also possibly impact earnings. For example, we anticipate the closing of the sale of Cartagena, our business in Spain, by year-end. Under the terms of the sale agreement, there are under and regulatory consents required. However, this sale closes before year and the transaction will provide adjusted earnings of up to $0.05, as a result of the settlement of disputes amounts due to Cartagena.
We will update investors as we get a better sense of outcomes in a timing related to be any of them until transactions that impact our result do they occur prior to our year-end call in February 2012.
With regards to 2012 guidance. Adjusted EPS and cash flow metrics remain on track within the ranges previously disclosed. This is the result of new plants coming online, the contributions from the planned acquisition of DP&L and projected operating performance at our existing businesses. In addition, market and other headwinds, such as the tariff reset in Brazil, are mitigated by the additional cost cuts that we have announced. As is our practice, we will update you on our first quarter 2012 earnings call.
With that, let me turn it back over to Andres."

Today, we announced our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year. However, I would like to highlight that this is but one component of a broader vision for AES future. We aim to improve our credit profile and earnings by focusing our new investments in core and key growing markets while prudently exiting noncore markets and businesses. We see a leaner, more efficient AES that takes full advantage of its business platforms to create shareholder value to earnings growth and a consistent dividend.
As part of our new organizational structure, Joel Abramson, will move to become Chief Financial Officer of generation, and I am pleased to announce that Ahmed Pasha will return to lead our Investor Relations effort. As we move forward on our goal of creating value for shareholders, we believe it will be more important than ever to effectively communicate our strategy and progress.
To that end, Victoria, Andy, Ned and I will be visiting investors in New York and Boston on the 17th and 18th of this month, as well as in London and the West Coast some time before the end of March of next year.

We do have certain, say, restrictions, under our debt covenants in terms of how much cash we can use for, I think, like dividends or share buybacks. And this is normally in the range of around $400 million to $500 million. So that outage one of the constraints that we have there. But in general, I think this is an amount that we feel comfortable, if you compare it to the subsidiary distributions from our big core companies, whether it be a, whether it be a DP&L, whether it be an IPO, it's we think the right amount. And we also have to take into consideration with what is offshore, onshore in terms of rather tax considerations. So all in all, this is a, we think, sustainable dividend.

You had also the hypothetical liquidated book value HLBB issues, which also pushed down earnings at the beginning of the year. So it's somewhat of a skewed picture I think what's most important is what servitors are we getting from these projects, are they coming online? Some of the projects have had issues with curtailment, I think a lot of these have been solved.. I mean, this is mostly in Bulgaria and in China. So overall, if you look at our portfolio, I think we've, your past, some of the projects are maturing out of the lease equity tax rate return time period. And also, if you look at going forward in the U.S., you have more investment tax credits and things like that, that will upfront the earnings relative to our initial projects."

35312,141270167,185208,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements: first is our continued progress on portfolio mana",1184,"Good morning, everyone, and thank for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements: first is our continued progress on portfolio management; second is the acceleration of our previously announced cost savings program; and third is our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We're on track to meet our 2011 guidance, and we believe that the steps that we are taking, such as accelerating cost savings, completing more than 1,500 megawatts of construction and closing the acquisition of DP&L, support strong earnings growth in 2012. Building on the seams from our May Investor Day, we're working to become a geographically focused and cost-efficient company with an improving credit profile. By paying a consistent quarterly dividend and growing our established business platforms, we believe we will be positioned to deliver compelling total shareholder returns. 
Starting with the first announcement. Our portfolio management plan aims to improve overall returns by selling non-core assets and focusing our investments in fewer markets, where we have a competitive advantage. As a reminder, our 3 core markets are the United States, Brazil and Chile. We also have important investment pipelines and projects under construction in Turkey, Poland, United Kingdom and Vietnam. There are markets, however, such as Spain and China, where we do not believe we can achieve the necessary scale or any competitive advantage that would support realizing the level of returns that we expect from our businesses. We plan to decrease our presence in such markets in a prudent yet consistent manner.
With regard to recent portfolio management activities, we have achieved 2 important milestones. The first was the to sign an agreement with the GDF Suez for a combined cycle plant in Cartagena, Spain. Under the agreement, GDF Suez, who's also the plant's off-taker and gas supplier, will buy 80% of our interest in the plant for EUR 172 million, with an option to buy the remainder for an additional EUR 28 million in 2013. Secondly, Brasiliana, our joint venture with BNDES, the Brazilian National Development Bank, received payment of $901 million this week for our telecom businesses in São Paulo and Rio. Of the net proceeds of $618 million, Brasiliana plans to use $480 million to retire very expensive debt, tearing an interest rate of 14.2% in reais. Besides improving earnings, this will further strengthen cash flows to AES by eliminating a large debt at A holding Company.
In both of these cases, we took advantage of attractive opportunities to simplify our portfolio by getting out of or materially reducing our presence in non-core markets and businesses. Though far less material to our results but in line with our portfolio management objectives, we also sold a small operations in the Czech Republic and have exited this market. 
During our Investor Day presentation in May of this year, the company set out a goal of reducing annual overhead costs by $100 million by the end of 2014. We initially set a target of achieving annualized savings of $10 million to $20 million for 2012. We have since decided to accelerate this program and have already taken steps that will increase our savings for the next year to a range of $40 million to $50 million. We expect to reach the target of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2013, a year earlier than our initial 2014 target.
Our cost savings for 2012 are mainly comprised of personnel reductions and third-party expenses related to business development in non-core markets, as well as reductions in our corporate support functions, flowing from our recently announced management structure. The new structure has 2 chief operating officers. Andy Vesey will run the utilities group and Ned Hall will head our generation group. Victoria Harker will assume additional responsibilities by leading risk and Global Business Services, comprised of information technology and non-fuel sourcing.
These changes will help us reduce cost by eliminating reporting layers and making better use of our global synergies and know how. At the same time, we will maintain our disciplined capital allocation process and level of financial controls.
All of these actions are being made in line with our strategy of focusing on our core and key growing markets, where we have or will have a sustainable competitive advantage. These reductions in business development expenses will not affect our ability to grow, either in the short term or long term, as we have plenty of remaining development projects and acquisition opportunities in our pipeline.
Regarding our third announcement. We intend to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of 2012 of $120 million annually, payable on equal quarterly installments, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. At today's share price, this represents a dividend of about 1.3% of our market cap. This timing will allow us to start realizing the benefit of the acquisition of DP&L and the commercial operations of new projects coming online this year.
At the same time, we wanted to provide investors with as much transparency as possible regarding our future plans, and that is why we're announcing it today. Of course, we will consider increasing the dividend over time, subject to our operational performance, credit profile and external market factors. A dividend will represent an important commitment to return cash to shareholders on a timely basis, as well as a demonstration of our confidence in future cash flows.
Speaking of returning money to our shareholders, during the third quarter, we took advantage of market volatility by repurchasing $126 million worth of shares. We repurchased an additional $54 million in October, bringing our total repurchases since July of 2010 to $378 million. 
Before turning the call over to Victoria, I would like to give you a brief update on our construction program and the acquisition of DP&L. During the third quarter, Maritza, our 670-megawatt lignite-fired plant in Bulgaria, passed its 72-hour full capacity operational test, meaning that as anticipated, it will produce earnings of approximately $0.11 next year. Our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydro plant in Panama and our 518-megawatt coal-fired plant Angamos in Chile have also achieved full commission. With these 3 additional plants, and our 98-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind project in Virginia, we've completed more than 1,500 megawatts of new construction slated for this year.
The acquisition of DP&L is proceeding smoothly. DP&L recently obtained approval from their shareholders. And with all funding in place, we're only waiting for approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and FERC. As you know, DP&L will be a major earnings and cash contributor in 2012 and will allow us to accelerate the use of substantial tax attributes available at AES. Planned activities are on track to fully integrate DP&L into the AES family of companies by early next year.
Now Victoria will walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, as well as expectations for full year 2011 and guidance for 2012."

First, our operating drivers. Volume trends in Latin America this quarter continued to show growth year-on-year. Our Brazilian utilities grew by 4%, driven by an increased demand. Similarly, our Latin American generation business has also benefited from higher volume. Chile experienced a demand growth, an essential growth of over 3%. Argentina had volume growth of 7% due to better availability of plants there. 
Earnings for the period also increased in part due to our new businesses, such as Maritza in Bulgaria, where increased capacity was brought online during the quarter, increasing its contribution both versus the prior year and also the second quarter of 2011. In addition, Ballylumford, our Northern Ireland business acquired in August 2010, contributed positive year-over-year earnings. 
These positive trends were partially offset by lower prices at a few of our businesses. At one of our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo, the regulated tariff is reviewed and reset every 4 years, but the July 2011 reset has not yet been finalized. As a result, for the third quarter, Eletropaulo continues to invoice customers under the existing tariff rate, as required by the regulator. However, it is expected that the new tariff, once finalized, will be lower than the existing tariff. Therefore, we also recognized the regulatory liability against a portion of these collected amounts from July 2011 forward. Likewise, we anticipate a reduction in revenue in 2012 and going forward once the tariff is enacted. 
As was true in the second quarter, the outage at Estí, our hydroelectric plant jointly owned with the government in Panama, continue to create a drag on our results for the third quarter versus the same quarter of 2010. The plant remains offline as repair work continues. During that time, it is meeting its contractual obligations through spot market energy purchases. While we did receive business interruption insurance proceeds of $30 million in the third quarter, the net impact is still negative for this quarter. As a reminder, the plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. 
Foreign exchange tailwinds experienced earlier in 2011 diminished in the third quarter, and foreign exchange had a minimal impact on our earnings for the period. However, FX tends to be very volatile as a result of global economic trends. 
Third quarter consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, which is an increase of $53 million or 5% compared to the same quarter of 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $563 million of gross margin, which was a decline of $25 million versus 2010, primarily due to the impact of the Panama outage.
This quarter, we also booked several impairments to operating assets, as well as directly meted investments that I'd like to walk you through. In total, these impairments represented $0.27 per share loss on a GAAP earnings basis. Approximately $0.10 of this was due to the impairment of 39 wind turbines held in storage and the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits made in prior years for the purchase of other wind turbines. An additional $0.12 of impairments was related to our investment in generation businesses in China. As we previously discussed, our business in China has experienced increased pressure on its operating margins due to higher coal prices, which we have not have the ability to pass through in tariffs there.
Finally, we impaired our Climate Solutions businesses due to a continued decline in the market prices for carbon offset. Please remember that these noncash expenses impact GAAP EPS from continuing operations, but they're excluded from our adjusted EPS results.
In the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.27, including $0.04 of costs related to the pending DP&L acquisition. Excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.31 or an increase of $0.11 over the third quarter of 2010. While proportional gross margin is down for the third quarter, adjusted EPS benefited from a favorable interim effective tax rate, a tax settlement in the Dominican Republic, as well as lower expenses. 
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.15, a decrease of $0.20 compared to the third quarter of 2010. This year-over-year change was driven by unrealized foreign exchange transaction impact, which swung from a $0.13 gain in the third quarter of 2010 to a loss of $0.10 in the third quarter of 2011.
These noncash losses are primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances as a result of the weakening of the Euro, British pound and Chilean peso during the quarter. 
Now let's discuss cash flow. Our cash flow results reflect many of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, operating cash flow grew as a result of favorable working capital at our business in Chile and the contribution of new businesses in Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, which was offset by declines in Eletropaulo, El Salvador and the Philippines, driven by higher regulatory charges and lower operating income, respectively. 
As a result, our operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was $127 million higher year-over-year on a consolidated basis and higher by $102 million on a proportional basis, driven by new businesses in Europe and improved working capital in Chile. Consolidated free cash flow increased by $55 million to $886 million for the quarter. This increase was driven by higher operating cash flows just discussed, partially offset by higher maintenance CapEx primarily in our Northern America utilities. This was primarily due to environmental projects there, as well as the Estí tunnel outage in Panama, as well as the stronger real in Brazil. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $55 million to $456 million. 
Now turning to parent liquidity. During the third quarter, parent liquidity benefited from $344 million of subsidiary distributions net of corporate overhead and interest expense during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we repurchased $126 million of AES shares as a result of market price opportunities. Additionally, we funded $414 million during the quarter. These investments consisted of prepayment of interest costs associated with the DP&L acquisition debt, as well as several construction and development projects, such as Mong Duong in Vietnam, Laurel Mountain in the U.S. and our AES Solar business. Our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $2.9 billion, down $200 million versus the second quarter of 2011. In some, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
As you know, full year adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, excluding the DP&L acquisition costs estimated at $0.13. As we look ahead to the conclusion of 2011, we have several transactions underway, which could impact our final results compared to our guidance previously given, the most material of which I'd like to highlight here.
We previously disclosed that we're pursuing a sale of our interest in Eastern Energy. As you recall, in March 2011, we placed Eastern Energy into discontinued operations based on our active sale process this year. Given where we are in the year, and while efforts to sell Eastern Energy continue, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our interest there. It is possible that Eastern Energy may no longer be classified as continued operations by year end and as a result, we may be required to include Eastern Energy's loss of $0.07 per share in the company's results of operations in 2011.
As previously referenced, we also have several other transactions ongoing which could also and positively impact earnings. For example, we anticipate the closing of the sale of Cartagena, our business in Spain, by year end. Under the terms of the sale agreement, there are ender and regulator consents required. However, this sale closes before year end. The transaction will provide adjusted earnings of up to $0.05 as a result of the settlement of dispute amounts due to Cartagena. We will update investors as we get a better sense of outcomes and the timing related to these and any other material transactions to the extent that they impact our result should they occur prior to our year-end call in February 2012.
With regard to 2012 guidance, adjusted EPS and cash flow metrics remain on track within the ranges previously disclosed. This is the result of new plants coming online, the contributions from the planned acquisition of DP&L and projected operating performance at our existing businesses. In addition, market and other headwinds, such as the tariff reset in Brazil, are mitigated by the additional cost cuts that we have announced. As is our practice, we will update you on our first quarter 2012 earnings call.
With that, let me turn it back over to Andres."

Today, we announced our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year. However, I would like to highlight that this is but one component of a broader vision for AES' future. We aim to improve our credit profile and earnings by focusing our new investments in core and key growing markets while prudently exiting non-core markets and businesses. We see a leaner, more efficient AES that takes full advantage of its business platforms to create shareholder value to earnings growth and a consistent dividend.
As part of our new organizational structure, Joel Abramson will move to become Chief Financial Officer of Generation. And I am pleased to announce that Ahmed Pasha will return to lead our Investor Relations effort. 
As we move forward on our goal of creating value for shareholders, we believe it will be more important than ever to effectively communicate our strategy and progress. To that end, Victoria, Andy, Ned and I will be visiting investors in New York and Boston on the 17th and 18th of this month, as well as in London and the West Coast some time before the end of March of next year. I look forward to seeing many of you soon. 
With that, let me turn it over to the operator so we can open up the call to questions. Operator?"

Once we have a number of important projects that we want to complete, and we'll be acting very prudent in this respect.

We will look at our credit profile, and we will look on what's going in the external market, which includes many factors.

And we're projecting the midpoint about $1.5 billion next year. But I think that sort of puts it in context $120 million in terms of our total subsidiary distribution. We do have certain, say, restrictions under our debt covenants in terms of how much cash we can use for, I think, like dividends or share buybacks. And this is normally in the range of around $400 million to $500 million. So that outage, one of the constraints that we have there. But in general, I think this is an amount that we feel comfortable if you compare it to the subsidiary distributions from our big core companies, whether it be a Gener, whether it be a DP&L, whether it be an IPL, it's -- we think the right amount. And we also have to take into consideration with what is offshore, onshore in terms of rather tax considerations. So all in all, this is a, we think, sustainable dividend.

Well, generally, what we've been talking about sort of core and non-core, it's been principally on a geographic basis.

If you're in a country where you have renewable portfolio standards and the most efficient way of meeting that is by wind, we want to have that in our arsenal to meet those requirement. Solar is different in the sense that it really is a JV that we have with Riverstone. And it operates today quite independently, a sort of AES' portfolio strategy. So I wouldn't say that -- the way to think about it is geographically and this is one component of our capability. And that doesn't mean that if in some geography we don't think it's strategic or we get a very good price and it would make sense to, say, turn that money into more highly productive investment, we will.

You had also the hypothetical liquidated book value, HLBV, issues, which also pushed down earnings at the beginning of the year. So it was somewhat of a skewed picture. I think what's most important is the sort of -- what sort of returns are we getting from these projects? Are they coming online? Some of the projects have had issues with curtailment. I think a lot of these have been solved. I mean, this is mostly in Bulgaria and in China. So overall, if you look at our portfolio, I think we've -- your past -- some of the projects are maturing out of the lease equity -- tax equity, sorry, time period.

Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio",1183,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio management; second is the acceleration of our previously announced cost savings program; and third is our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We're on track to meet our 2011 guidance, and we believe that the steps that we are taking, such as accelerating cost savings, completing more than 1,500 megawatts of construction and closing the acquisition of DP&L, support strong earnings growth in 2012. Building on the themes from our May Investor Day, we're working to become a geographically focused and cost-efficient company with an improving credit profile. By paying a consistent quarterly dividend and growing our established business platforms, we believe we will be positioned to deliver compelling total shareholder returns. 
Starting with the first announcement. Our portfolio management plan aims to improve overall returns by selling non-core assets and focusing our investments in fewer markets, where we have a competitive advantage. As a reminder, our 3 core markets are the United States, Brazil and Chile. We also have important investment pipelines and projects under construction in Turkey, Poland, United Kingdom and Vietnam. There are markets, however, such as Spain and China, where we do not believe we can achieve the necessary scale or any competitive advantage that would support realizing the level of returns that we expect from our businesses. We plan to decrease our presence in such markets in a prudent yet consistent manner.
With regard to recent portfolio management activities, we have achieved 2 important milestones. The first was to sign an agreement with GDF Suez for a combined cycle plant in Cartagena, Spain. Under the agreement, GDF Suez, who's also the plant's off-taker and gas supplier, will buy 80% of our interest in the plant for EUR 172 million, with an option to buy the remainder for an additional EUR 28 million in 2013. Secondly, Brasiliana, our joint venture with BNDES, the Brazilian National Development Bank, received payment of $901 million this week for our telecom businesses in São Paulo and Rio. Of the net proceeds of $618 million, Brasiliana plans to use $480 million to retire very expensive debt carrying an interest rate of 14.2% in reals. Besides improving earnings, this will further strengthen cash flows to AES by eliminating a large debt at our holding company.
In both of these cases, we took advantage of attractive opportunities to simplify our portfolio by getting out of or materially reducing our presence in non-core markets and businesses. Though far less material to our results but in line with our portfolio management objectives, we also sold a small operations in the Czech Republic and have exited this market. 
During our Investor Day presentation in May of this year, the company set out a goal of reducing annual overhead costs by $100 million by the end of 2014. We initially set a target of achieving annualized savings of $10 million to $20 million for 2012. We have since decided to accelerate this program and have already taken steps that will increase our savings for the next year to a range of $40 million to $50 million. We expect to reach the target of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2013, a year earlier than our initial 2014 target.
Our cost savings for 2012 are mainly comprised of personnel reductions and third-party expenses related to business development in non-core markets, as well as reductions in our corporate support functions, flowing from our recently announced management structure. The new structure has 2 chief operating officers. Andy Vesey will run the utilities group and Ned Hall will head our generation group. Victoria Harker will assume additional responsibilities by leading risk and Global Business Services, comprised of information technology and non-fuel sourcing.
These changes will help us reduce cost by eliminating reporting layers and making better use of our global synergies and know how. At the same time, we will maintain our disciplined capital allocation process and level of financial controls.
All of these actions are being made in line with our strategy of focusing on our core and key growing markets, where we have or will have a sustainable competitive advantage. These reductions in business development expenses will not affect our ability to grow, either in the short term or long term, as we have plenty of remaining development projects and acquisition opportunities in our pipeline.
Regarding our third announcement. We intend to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of 2012 of $120 million annually, payable in equal quarterly installments, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. At today's share price, this represents a dividend of about 1.3% of our market cap. This timing will allow us to start realizing the benefit of the acquisition of DP&L and the commercial operations of new projects coming online this year.
At the same time, we wanted to provide investors with as much transparency as possible regarding our future plans, and that is why we're announcing it today. Of course, we will consider increasing the dividend over time, subject to our operational performance, credit profile and external market factors. A dividend will represent an important commitment to return cash to shareholders on a timely basis, as well as a demonstration of our confidence in future cash flows.
Speaking of returning money to our shareholders, during the third quarter, we took advantage of market volatility by repurchasing $126 million worth of shares. We repurchased an additional $54 million in October, bringing our total repurchases since July of 2010 to $378 million. 
Before turning the call over to Victoria, I would like to give you a brief update on our construction program and the acquisition of DP&L. During the third quarter, Maritza, our 670-megawatt lignite-fired plant in Bulgaria, passed its 72-hour full capacity operational test, meaning that as anticipated, it will produce earnings of approximately $0.11 next year. Our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydro plant in Panama and our 518-megawatt coal-fired plant Angamos in Chile have also achieved full commissioning. With these 3 additional plants, and our 98-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind project in Virginia, we've completed more than 1,500 megawatts of new construction slated for this year.
The acquisition of DP&L is proceeding smoothly. DP&L recently obtained approval from their shareholders. And with all funding in place, we're only waiting for approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and FERC. As you know, DP&L will be a major earnings and cash contributor in 2012 and will allow us to accelerate the use of substantial tax attributes available at AES. Planned activities are on track to fully integrate DP&L into the AES family of companies by early next year.
Now Victoria will walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, as well as expectations for full year 2011 and guidance for 2012."

I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter, then I'll walk through our other key financial metrics, as well as parent liquidity. 
First, our operating drivers. Volume trends in Latin America this quarter continued to show growth year-on-year. Our Brazilian utilities grew by 4%, driven by increased demand. Similarly, our Latin American generation business has also benefited from higher volume. Chile experienced a demand growth, an essential growth of over 3%. Argentina had volume growth of 7% due to better availability of plants there. 
Earnings for the period also increased in part due to our new businesses, such as Maritza in Bulgaria, where increased capacity was brought online during the quarter, increasing its contribution both versus the prior year and also the second quarter of 2011. In addition, Ballylumford, our Northern Ireland business acquired in August of 2010, contributed positive year-over-year earnings. 
These positive trends were partially offset by lower prices at a few of our businesses. At one of our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo, the regulated tariff is reviewed and reset every 4 years, but the July 2011 reset has not yet been finalized. As a result, for the third quarter, Eletropaulo continues to invoice customers under the existing tariff rate, as required by the regulator. However, it is expected that the new tariff, once finalized, will be lower than the existing tariff. Therefore, we also recognized the regulatory liability against a portion of these collected amounts from July 2011 forward. Likewise, we anticipate a reduction in revenue in 2012 and going forward once the tariff is enacted. 
As was true in the second quarter, the outage at Estí, our hydroelectric plant jointly owned with the government in Panama, continued to create a drag on our results for the third quarter versus the same quarter of 2010. The plant remains offline as repair work continues. During that time, it is meeting its contractual obligations through spot market energy purchases. While we did receive business interruption insurance proceeds of $30 million in the third quarter, the net impact is still negative for this quarter. As a reminder, the plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. 
Foreign exchange tailwinds experienced earlier in 2011 diminished in the third quarter, and foreign exchange had a minimal impact on our earnings for the period. However, FX tends to be very volatile as a result of global economic trends. 
Third quarter consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, which is an increase of $53 million or 5% compared to the same quarter of 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $563 million of gross margin, which was a decline of $25 million versus 2010, primarily due to the impact of the Panama outage.
This quarter, we also booked several impairments to operating assets, as well as directly [indiscernible] investments that I'd like to walk you through. In total, these impairments represented $0.27 per share loss on a GAAP earnings basis. Approximately $0.10 of this was due to the impairment of 39 wind turbines held in storage and the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits made in prior years for the purchase of other wind turbines. An additional $0.12 of impairments was related to our investment in generation businesses in China. As we previously discussed, our business in China has experienced increased pressure on its operating margins due to higher coal prices, which we have not had the ability to pass through in tariffs there.
Finally, we impaired our Climate Solutions businesses due to a continued decline in the market prices for carbon offset. Please remember that these noncash expenses impact GAAP EPS from continuing operations, but they're excluded from our adjusted EPS results.
In the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.27, including $0.04 of costs related to the pending DP&L acquisition. Excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 or an increase of $0.11 over the third quarter of 2010. While proportional gross margin is down for the third quarter, adjusted EPS benefited from a favorable interim effective tax rate, a tax settlement in the Dominican Republic, as well as lower expenses. 
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.15, a decrease of $0.20 compared to the third quarter of 2010. This year-over-year change was driven by unrealized foreign exchange transaction impact, which swung from a $0.13 gain in the third quarter of 2010 to a loss of $0.10 in the third quarter of 2011.
These noncash losses are primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances as a result of the weakening of the Euro, British pound and Chilean peso during the quarter. 
Now let's discuss cash flow. Our cash flow results reflect many of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, operating cash flow grew as a result of favorable working capital at our business in Chile and the contribution of new businesses in Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, which was offset by declines in Eletropaulo, El Salvador and the Philippines, driven by higher regulatory charges and lower operating income, respectively. 
As a result, our operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was $127 million higher year-over-year on a consolidated basis and higher by $102 million on a proportional basis, driven by new businesses in Europe and improved working capital in Chile. Consolidated free cash flow increased by $55 million to $886 million for the quarter. This increase was driven by higher operating cash flow as just discussed, partially offset by higher maintenance CapEx primarily in our Northern America utilities. This was primarily due to environmental projects there, as well as the Estí tunnel outage in Panama, as well as the stronger real in Brazil. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $55 million to $456 million. 
Now turning to parent liquidity. During the third quarter, parent liquidity benefited from $344 million of subsidiary distributions net of corporate overhead and interest expense during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we repurchased $126 million of AES shares as a result of market price opportunities. Additionally, we funded $414 million during the quarter. These investments consisted of prepayment of interest costs associated with the DP&L acquisition debt, as well as several construction and development projects, such as Mong Duong in Vietnam, Laurel Mountain in the U.S. and our AES Solar business. Our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $2.9 billion, down $200 million versus the second quarter of 2011. In some, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
As you know, full year adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, excluding the DP&L acquisition costs estimated at $0.13. As we look ahead to the conclusion of 2011, we have several transactions underway, which could impact our final results compared to our guidance previously given, the most material of which I'd like to highlight here.
We previously disclosed that we're pursuing a sale of our interest in Eastern Energy. As you recall, in March 2011, we placed Eastern Energy into discontinued operations based on our active sale process this year. Given where we are in the year, and while efforts to sell Eastern Energy continue, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our interest there. It is possible that Eastern Energy may no longer be classified as continued operations by year end and as a result, we may be required to include Eastern Energy's loss of $0.07 per share in the company's results of operations in 2011.
As previously referenced, we also have several other transactions ongoing which could also and positively impact earnings. For example, we anticipate the closing of the sale of Cartagena, our business in Spain, by year end. Under the terms of the sale agreement, there are ender and regulator consents required. However, if this sale closes before year end, the transaction will provide adjusted earnings of up to $0.05 as a result of the settlement of dispute amounts due to Cartagena. We will update investors as we get a better sense of outcomes and the timing related to these and any other material transactions to the extent that they impact our results should they occur prior to our year-end call in February 2012.
With regard to 2012 guidance, adjusted EPS and cash flow metrics remain on track within the ranges previously disclosed. This is the result of new plants coming online, the contributions from the planned acquisition of DP&L and projected operating performance at our existing businesses. In addition, market and other headwinds, such as the tariff reset in Brazil, are mitigated by the additional cost cuts that we have announced. As is our practice, we will update you on our first quarter 2012 earnings call.
With that, let me turn it back over to Andres."

Today, we announced our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year. However, I would like to highlight that this is but one component of a broader vision for AES' future. We aim to improve our credit profile and earnings by focusing our new investments in core and key growing markets while prudently exiting non-core markets and businesses. We see a leaner, more efficient AES that takes full advantage of its business platforms to create shareholder value to earnings growth and a consistent dividend.
As part of our new organizational structure, Joel Abramson will move to become Chief Financial Officer of Generation. And I am pleased to announce that Ahmed Pasha will return to lead our Investor Relations effort. 
As we move forward on our goal of creating value for shareholders, we believe it will be more important than ever to effectively communicate our strategy and progress. To that end, Victoria, Andy, Ned and I will be visiting investors in New York and Boston on the 17th and 18th of this month, as well as in London and the West Coast some time before the end of March of next year. I look forward to seeing many of you soon.

So we have a number of important projects that we want to complete, and we'll be acting very prudent in this respect.

We will look at our credit profile, and we will look on what's going on in the external market, which includes many factors.

So if you look at the growth of our subsidiary distributions, they have grown from about $1 billion, have been for many years to this year being about $1.25 billion. And we're projecting the midpoint about $1.5 billion next year. But I think that sort of puts it in context $120 million in terms of our total subsidiary distributions. We do have certain, say, restrictions under our debt covenants in terms of how much cash we can use for things like dividends or share buybacks. And this is normally in the range of around $400 million to $500 million. So that’s, I would say, one of the constraints that we have there. But in general, I think this is an amount that we feel comfortable if you compare it to the subsidiary distributions from our big core companies, whether it be a Gener, whether it be a DP&L, whether it be an IPL, it's, we think, the right amount. And we also have to take into consideration with what is offshore, onshore in terms of other tax considerations. So all in all, this is a, we think, sustainable dividend. It's a good place to start, and I think that the timing’s right."

Solar is different in the sense that it really is a JV that we have with Riverstone. And it operates today quite independently, a sort of AES' portfolio strategy. So I wouldn't say that -- the way to think about it is geographically and this is one component of our capability.

You had also the hypothetical liquidated book value, HLBV, issues, which also pushed down earnings at the beginning of the year. So it was somewhat of a skewed picture. I think what's most important is the sort of -- what sort of returns are we getting from these projects? Are they coming online? Some of the projects have had issues with curtailment. I think a lot of these have been solved. I mean, this is mostly in Bulgaria and in China. So overall, if you look at our portfolio, I think we've -- your past -- some of the projects are maturing out of the lease equity -- tax equity, sorry, time period.

35312,141270167,185896,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio",1183,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for calling in this morning. Welcome to my first earnings call as CEO. Today, in addition to reporting a strong third quarter, we have a number of important announcements. First is our continued progress on portfolio management; second is the acceleration of our previously announced cost savings program; and third is our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We're on track to meet our 2011 guidance, and we believe that the steps that we are taking, such as accelerating cost savings, completing more than 1,500 megawatts of construction and closing the acquisition of DP&L, support strong earnings growth in 2012. Building on the themes from our May Investor Day, we're working to become a geographically focused and cost-efficient company with an improving credit profile. By paying a consistent quarterly dividend and growing our established business platforms, we believe we will be positioned to deliver compelling total shareholder returns. 
Starting with the first announcement. Our portfolio management plan aims to improve overall returns by selling non-core assets and focusing our investments in fewer markets, where we have a competitive advantage. As a reminder, our 3 core markets are the United States, Brazil and Chile. We also have important investment pipelines and projects under construction in Turkey, Poland, United Kingdom and Vietnam. There are markets, however, such as Spain and China, where we do not believe we can achieve the necessary scale or any competitive advantage that would support realizing the level of returns that we expect from our businesses. We plan to decrease our presence in such markets in a prudent yet consistent manner.
With regard to recent portfolio management activities, we have achieved 2 important milestones. The first was to sign an agreement with GDF Suez for a combined cycle plant in Cartagena, Spain. Under the agreement, GDF Suez, who's also the plant's off-taker and gas supplier, will buy 80% of our interest in the plant for EUR 172 million, with an option to buy the remainder for an additional EUR 28 million in 2013. Secondly, Brasiliana, our joint venture with BNDES, the Brazilian National Development Bank, received payment of $901 million this week for our telecom businesses in São Paulo and Rio. Of the net proceeds of $618 million, Brasiliana plans to use $480 million to retire very expensive debt carrying an interest rate of 14.2% in reais. Besides improving earnings, this will further strengthen cash flows to AES by eliminating a large debt at our holding company.
In both of these cases, we took advantage of attractive opportunities to simplify our portfolio by getting out of or materially reducing our presence in non-core markets and businesses. Though far less material to our results but in line with our portfolio management objectives, we also sold a small operations in the Czech Republic and have exited this market. 
During our Investor Day presentation in May of this year, the company set out a goal of reducing annual overhead costs by $100 million by the end of 2014. We initially set a target of achieving annualized savings of $10 million to $20 million for 2012. We have since decided to accelerate this program and have already taken steps that will increase our savings for the next year to a range of $40 million to $50 million. We expect to reach the target of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2013, a year earlier than our initial 2014 target.
Our cost savings for 2012 are mainly comprised of personnel reductions and third-party expenses related to business development in non-core markets, as well as reductions in our corporate support functions, flowing from our recently announced management structure. The new structure has 2 chief operating officers. Andy Vesey will run the utilities group and Ned Hall will head our generation group. Victoria Harker will assume additional responsibilities by leading risk and Global Business Services, comprised of information technology and non-fuel sourcing.
These changes will help us reduce cost by eliminating reporting layers and making better use of our global synergies and know how. At the same time, we will maintain our disciplined capital allocation process and level of financial controls.
All of these actions are being made in line with our strategy of focusing on our core and key growing markets, where we have or will have a sustainable competitive advantage. These reductions in business development expenses will not affect our ability to grow, either in the short term or long term, as we have plenty of remaining development projects and acquisition opportunities in our pipeline.
Regarding our third announcement. We intend to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of 2012 of $120 million annually, payable in equal quarterly installments, with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. At today's share price, this represents a dividend of about 1.3% of our market cap. This timing will allow us to start realizing the benefit of the acquisition of DP&L and the commercial operations of new projects coming online this year.
At the same time, we wanted to provide investors with as much transparency as possible regarding our future plans, and that is why we're announcing it today. Of course, we will consider increasing the dividend over time, subject to our operational performance, credit profile and external market factors. A dividend will represent an important commitment to return cash to shareholders on a timely basis, as well as a demonstration of our confidence in future cash flows.
Speaking of returning money to our shareholders, during the third quarter, we took advantage of market volatility by repurchasing $126 million worth of shares. We repurchased an additional $54 million in October, bringing our total repurchases since July of 2010 to $378 million. 
Before turning the call over to Victoria, I would like to give you a brief update on our construction program and the acquisition of DP&L. During the third quarter, Maritza, our 670-megawatt lignite-fired plant in Bulgaria, passed its 72-hour full capacity operational test, meaning that as anticipated, it will produce earnings of approximately $0.11 next year. Our 223-megawatt Changuinola hydro plant in Panama and our 518-megawatt coal-fired plant Angamos in Chile have also achieved full commissioning. With these 3 additional plants, and our 98-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind project in Virginia, we've completed more than 1,500 megawatts of new construction slated for this year.
The acquisition of DP&L is proceeding smoothly. DP&L recently obtained approval from their shareholders. And with all funding in place, we're only waiting for approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and FERC. As you know, DP&L will be a major earnings and cash contributor in 2012 and will allow us to accelerate the use of substantial tax attributes available at AES. Planned activities are on track to fully integrate DP&L into the AES family of companies by early next year.
Now Victoria will walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, as well as expectations for full year 2011 and guidance for 2012."
35312,141270167,185896,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter, then I'll walk through our other key financial metrics, as well as parent l",1481,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on the performance of key operating drivers that impacted our earnings and cash flow results for the quarter, then I'll walk through our other key financial metrics, as well as parent liquidity. 
First, our operating drivers. Volume trends in Latin America this quarter continued to show growth year-on-year. Our Brazilian utilities grew by 4%, driven by increased demand. Similarly, our Latin American generation business has also benefited from higher volume. Chile experienced a demand growth, an essential growth of over 3%. Argentina had volume growth of 7% due to better availability of plants there. 
Earnings for the period also increased in part due to our new businesses, such as Maritza in Bulgaria, where increased capacity was brought online during the quarter, increasing its contribution both versus the prior year and also the second quarter of 2011. In addition, Ballylumford, our Northern Ireland business acquired in August of 2010, contributed positive year-over-year earnings. 
These positive trends were partially offset by lower prices at a few of our businesses. At one of our Brazilian utilities, Eletropaulo, the regulated tariff is reviewed and reset every 4 years, but the July 2011 reset has not yet been finalized. As a result, for the third quarter, Eletropaulo continues to invoice customers under the existing tariff rate, as required by the regulator. However, it is expected that the new tariff, once finalized, will be lower than the existing tariff. Therefore, we also recognized the regulatory liability against a portion of these collected amounts from July 2011 forward. Likewise, we anticipate a reduction in revenue in 2012 and going forward once the tariff is enacted. 
As was true in the second quarter, the outage at Estí, our hydroelectric plant jointly owned with the government in Panama, continued to create a drag on our results for the third quarter versus the same quarter of 2010. The plant remains offline as repair work continues. During that time, it is meeting its contractual obligations through spot market energy purchases. While we did receive business interruption insurance proceeds of $30 million in the third quarter, the net impact is still negative for this quarter. As a reminder, the plant is expected to be back online during the second half of 2012. 
Foreign exchange tailwinds experienced earlier in 2011 diminished in the third quarter, and foreign exchange had a minimal impact on our earnings for the period. However, FX tends to be very volatile as a result of global economic trends. 
Third quarter consolidated gross margin was just over $1 billion, which is an increase of $53 million or 5% compared to the same quarter of 2010. On a proportional basis, we earned $563 million of gross margin, which was a decline of $25 million versus 2010, primarily due to the impact of the Panama outage.
This quarter, we also booked several impairments to operating assets, as well as directly [indiscernible] investments that I'd like to walk you through. In total, these impairments represented $0.27 per share loss on a GAAP earnings basis. Approximately $0.10 of this was due to the impairment of 39 wind turbines held in storage and the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits made in prior years for the purchase of other wind turbines. An additional $0.12 of impairments was related to our investment in generation businesses in China. As we previously discussed, our business in China has experienced increased pressure on its operating margins due to higher coal prices, which we have not had the ability to pass through in tariffs there.
Finally, we impaired our Climate Solutions businesses due to a continued decline in the market prices for carbon offset. Please remember that these noncash expenses impact GAAP EPS from continuing operations, but they're excluded from our adjusted EPS results.
In the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.27, including $0.04 of costs related to the pending DP&L acquisition. Excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 or an increase of $0.11 over the third quarter of 2010. While proportional gross margin is down for the third quarter, adjusted EPS benefited from a favorable interim effective tax rate, a tax settlement in the Dominican Republic, as well as lower expenses. 
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $0.15, a decrease of $0.20 compared to the third quarter of 2010. This year-over-year change was driven by unrealized foreign exchange transaction impact, which swung from a $0.13 gain in the third quarter of 2010 to a loss of $0.10 in the third quarter of 2011.
These noncash losses are primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of foreign denominated receivables and cash balances as a result of the weakening of the Euro, British pound and Chilean peso during the quarter. 
Now let's discuss cash flow. Our cash flow results reflect many of the same trends that impacted earnings. On a consolidated basis, operating cash flow grew as a result of favorable working capital at our business in Chile and the contribution of new businesses in Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, which was offset by declines in Eletropaulo, El Salvador and the Philippines, driven by higher regulatory charges and lower operating income, respectively. 
As a result, our operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was $127 million higher year-over-year on a consolidated basis and higher by $102 million on a proportional basis, driven by new businesses in Europe and improved working capital in Chile. Consolidated free cash flow increased by $55 million to $886 million for the quarter. This increase was driven by higher operating cash flow as just discussed, partially offset by higher maintenance CapEx primarily in our Northern America utilities. This was primarily due to environmental projects there, as well as the Estí tunnel outage in Panama, as well as the stronger real in Brazil. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $55 million to $456 million. 
Now turning to parent liquidity. During the third quarter, parent liquidity benefited from $344 million of subsidiary distributions net of corporate overhead and interest expense during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we repurchased $126 million of AES shares as a result of market price opportunities. Additionally, we funded $414 million during the quarter. These investments consisted of prepayment of interest costs associated with the DP&L acquisition debt, as well as several construction and development projects, such as Mong Duong in Vietnam, Laurel Mountain in the U.S. and our AES Solar business. Our parent liquidity at quarter end is now $2.9 billion, down $200 million versus the second quarter of 2011. In some, the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
As you know, full year adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.14, excluding the DP&L acquisition costs estimated at $0.13. As we look ahead to the conclusion of 2011, we have several transactions underway, which could impact our final results compared to our guidance previously given, the most material of which I'd like to highlight here.
We previously disclosed that we're pursuing a sale of our interest in Eastern Energy. As you recall, in March 2011, we placed Eastern Energy into discontinued operations based on our active sale process this year. Given where we are in the year, and while efforts to sell Eastern Energy continue, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our interest there. It is possible that Eastern Energy may no longer be classified as continued operations by year end and as a result, we may be required to include Eastern Energy's loss of $0.07 per share in the company's results of operations in 2011.
As previously referenced, we also have several other transactions ongoing which could also and positively impact earnings. For example, we anticipate the closing of the sale of Cartagena, our business in Spain, by year end. Under the terms of the sale agreement, there are ender and regulator consents required. However, if this sale closes before year end, the transaction will provide adjusted earnings of up to $0.05 as a result of the settlement of dispute amounts due to Cartagena. We will update investors as we get a better sense of outcomes and the timing related to these and any other material transactions to the extent that they impact our results should they occur prior to our year-end call in February 2012.
With regard to 2012 guidance, adjusted EPS and cash flow metrics remain on track within the ranges previously disclosed. This is the result of new plants coming online, the contributions from the planned acquisition of DP&L and projected operating performance at our existing businesses. In addition, market and other headwinds, such as the tariff reset in Brazil, are mitigated by the additional cost cuts that we have announced. As is our practice, we will update you on our first quarter 2012 earnings call.
With that, let me turn it back over to Andres."

Today, we announced our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of next year. However, I would like to highlight that this is but one component of a broader vision for AES' future. We aim to improve our credit profile and earnings by focusing our new investments in core and key growing markets while prudently exiting non-core markets and businesses. We see a leaner, more efficient AES that takes full advantage of its business platforms to create shareholder value to earnings growth and a consistent dividend.
As part of our new organizational structure, Joel Abramson will move to become Chief Financial Officer of Generation. And I am pleased to announce that Ahmed Pasha will return to lead our Investor Relations effort. 
As we move forward on our goal of creating value for shareholders, we believe it will be more important than ever to effectively communicate our strategy and progress. To that end, Victoria, Andy, Ned and I will be visiting investors in New York and Boston on the 17th and 18th of this month, as well as in London and the West Coast some time before the end of March of next year. I look forward to seeing many of you soon.

We will look at our credit profile, and we will look on what's going on in the external market, which includes many factors.

So if you look at the growth of our subsidiary distributions, they have grown from about $1 billion, have been for many years to this year being about $1.25 billion. And we're projecting the midpoint about $1.5 billion next year. But I think that sort of puts it in context $120 million in terms of our total subsidiary distributions. We do have certain, say, restrictions under our debt covenants in terms of how much cash we can use for things like dividends or share buybacks. And this is normally in the range of around $400 million to $500 million. So that’s, I would say, one of the constraints that we have there. But in general, I think this is an amount that we feel comfortable if you compare it to the subsidiary distributions from our big core companies, whether it be a Gener, whether it be a DP&L, whether it be an IPL, it's, we think, the right amount. And we also have to take into consideration with what is offshore, onshore in terms of other tax considerations. So all in all, this is a, we think, sustainable dividend. It's a good place to start, and I think that the timing’s right."

There were a number of issues there.

You had also the hypothetical liquidated book value, HLBV, issues, which also pushed down earnings at the beginning of the year. So it was somewhat of a skewed picture. I think what's most important is the sort of -- what sort of returns are we getting from these projects? Are they coming online? Some of the projects have had issues with curtailment. I think a lot of these have been solved. I mean, this is mostly in Bulgaria and in China. So overall, if you look at our portfolio, I think we've -- your past -- some of the projects are maturing out of the lease equity -- tax equity, sorry, time period.
