I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results.

I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results. Business and consumer response to our latest wave of innovation, including Office 2010 and Kinect, helped drive yet another quarter of healthy revenue growth, resulting in revenue of nearly $20 billion. 
Our solid revenue performance, combined with cost controls and continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities, enabled us to deliver record earnings per share and our sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion. 
On our last earnings call, I commented that we were looking forward to an exciting holiday quarter, especially from consumers. Kinect, in particular, exceeded our expectation. The controller-free entertainment experience is revolutionizing the living room. Kinect is the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history. We couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished. But importantly, it's just our first step in delivering on the opportunity to fundamentally change the way people interact with technology. 
The Microsoft Business Division also had a terrific quarter. Office 2010 is the most successful consumer version we have ever shipped, and the product is also performing extremely well in the Business segment. Companies are purchasing Office 2010 as well as our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange and Lync. 
Businesses are also deploying Windows 7. According to IDC, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have already started their formal migrations to Windows 7. 
In addition to healthy enterprise deployment of our Business Desktop products, we saw strong momentum for our business infrastructure offerings. Windows Server and SQL Server premium revenues grew double digits, and this quarter marks the one year anniversary of Windows Server 2008 R2. Since its launch, we have grown our share of the overall server market every quarter. 
During the quarter, we continued our product launch momentum. In November, we delivered Microsoft Lync 2010, a next-generation communications platform that incorporates instant messaging, presence, audio, video, Web conferencing and voice into one interface that integrates with the applications businesses are already using today, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Exchange. 
For the consumer, I already mentioned Kinect. Also during the quarter, we launched Windows Phone 7, which is now on nine devices and 60 operators in 30 markets. We said all along that our first priority was to make a phone people love, and to that end, we're pleased with the initial response. Customer satisfaction data indicates 93% of customers worldwide are happy with the product, and we're also seeing strong developer engagement. While we're encouraged by the early progress, we realize we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we remain focused and committed to the long-term success of Windows Phone 7. 
We continued to deliver sustained innovation and releases for Bing. In addition to transitioning Yahoo!'s Page Search in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook. Bing now provides much more personalized experiences by allowing users to bring their Facebook friends into their Search experiences. 
So in summary, a record performance for this quarter rounded out a very successful calendar year for Microsoft. We delivered strong financial results and invigorated the market with our product innovation. With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results."

I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year.

I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year. The deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability. We've reconciled the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. 
Okay, now to our results. This quarter's performance continued the momentum we've seen over the past year. Total revenue for the company was up 15% to nearly $20 billion. Operating income grew 20% and earnings per share grew 28%. Bookings grew 21%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit bookings growth. 
We continued to see strong momentum with Windows 7. As Peter mentioned, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have started their formal migrations to Windows 7 and many have already recognized material savings as a result. 
Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 for the equivalent period following launch. Office clearly remains the world's most popular productivity platform for both home and work. 
We've experienced an incredible consumer response to our latest products. Kinect, in particular, was the hottest gift this holiday season and has been mentioned by a number of publications as the most innovative product of 2010. 
Businesses of all sizes continued to commit to Microsoft's platforms. This quarter, we saw a better-than-expected increase in transactional licensing and Enterprise Agreements renewed in the historical range. 
Our honored revenue balance grew 7% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. On a sequential basis, after adjusting for the $224 million of Office Tech Guarantee recognition, our honored revenue balance declined $278 million. Our contracted not billed balance grew to over $16.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the prior quarter. This growth in our customer's multiyear commitment, combined with our strong transactional sales, resulted in a solid 21% growth in year-over-year bookings. Geographically, emerging markets continued to outperform mature markets. 
Now turning to the PC market, we estimate close to 90 million PCs were sold globally, the biggest quarter ever, representing growth of 2% to 4%. Business PCs grew faster than consumer PCs as companies continued to refresh hardware and has opt to Windows 7. Within consumer PCs, netbooks declined from their peak last year while notebook growth remained healthy. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted that there would be a $600 million headwind to Windows comparables for the second quarter due to the Windows 7 launch spike last year. Adjusting for this dynamic and the prior year-over-year Tech Guarantee recognition, Windows and Windows Live revenue growth was in line with the PC market. 
As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The revenue per license benefit from a higher business mix was offset by emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. 
This quarter marks the one-year anniversary of Windows 7. Today, we are announcing that we have sold over 300 million Windows 7 licenses to date, continuing its momentum as the fastest-selling operating system in history. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC and Windows 7 ecosystem as seen at CES. The PC hardware dynamics are incredibly strong, with innovation in new ultraportables all-in-ones and other form factors, including tablets, plates and convertibles. The new Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Fusion Chip architectures substantially improved performance, graphics and battery life. 
In addition, we announced at CES that the next version of Windows will support System on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems form partners NVIDIA, QUALCOMM and Texas Instruments and x86-based systems from partners Intel and AMD. Windows on System on a Chip architectures will fuel significant innovation across a spectrum of devices. We are enthusiastic about the future of device innovation and the role Windows is playing. 
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth. Non-annuity revenue grew roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew high-single-digits. Multiyear license revenue growth was roughly 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 9%. In the data center, we continue to be pleased with our progress in virtualization and systems management. The virtualization trend is driving double-digit System Center and Windows Server premium revenue growth while significantly lowering our customers' costs. In the database, premium offerings are also a core focus of our strategy, and this quarter, we saw double-digit growth in SQL Server premium revenue. 
Among other customer wins this quarter, Thrifty Auto Group migrated their mission-critical pricing system from Oracle to a Microsoft data management solution, a strategic move that supports the company's goal to standardize on high-value cost-effective technologies. We are excited about SQL Server and our opportunity to drive Tier 1 customer wins. 
In the cloud, we continued to see developer interest and application development on the Windows Azure platform. Earlier in the quarter at PDC, we had held a number of additional platform enhancement and showed leading companies like Pixar Animation Studios and ADP with NVoicePay were able to develop innovative solutions with Azure. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division which grew 19%. Online advertising revenue, including both Search & Display, grew 23% and now includes revenue-driven by our Search partnership with Yahoo!, which is implemented in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter. We continue to make progress on the partnership, and earlier this month, we transitioned to algorithmic search traffic in Mexico, Brazil and Australia. 
Bing's U.S. market share continued to grow, ending the quarter at 12% and our Search revenue growth rate again outperformed the market leader. 
During the quarter, we announced the significant expansion of our partnership with Facebook, where Bing will provide more personalized experiences by allowing users to Search Facebook profiles and incorporate their friend's Like into Search results. We believe the addition of these new social features is another way to deliver innovation and valuable enhancements to the Bing experience. 
Next, I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which continues to show solid launch momentum with revenue growing 24%. This includes $224 million of recognized revenue pertaining to the Office Tech Guarantee. We've seen enthusiastic consumer response to Office 2010 and business demand has also been strong, with the transactional components of MBD sales up over 40%. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. CIOs are investing in the new productivity scenarios enabled by SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM, which are enhanced when deployed with Office 2010. 
Lync grew over 20% this quarter while SharePoint 2010 and Dynamics CRM both continue to grow double digits. This quarter, we reported a number of productivity wins, including the State University of New York, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, DuPont and the state of California, among others. We had seen an immediate customer and partner response to the Office 365 announcement, with the beta oversubscribed within its first day. 
Just two weeks ago, we launched Dynamics CRM online in 40 markets. We're already seeing customers switching from salesforce.com to Dynamics CRM online. It saves money, it's more fixable and it's easy to use with the familiar Microsoft Office experience for increased productivity.
Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 55% and operating income has now surpassed $1 billion year-to-date, which is a major milestone for this division. Kinect exceeded all expectations with 8 million stand-alone and bundled sensors sold in just 60 days. And since we updated the consoles last June, Xbox 360 has had tremendous momentum. We sold a record 6.3 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 21%. This helped drive Xbox Live membership up 30% to 30 million active members. 
In addition, at CES, we announced a number of upcoming feature enhancements, including Kinect support for, Netflix, Google Plus and Avatar Kinect, which will advance how people communicate and enjoy their television experiences. 
Windows Phone 7 is off to a solid start as handset manufacturers purchased over 2 million licenses in the quarter. Windows Phone 7 is making progress in its early days as user satisfaction is extremely high, and developer momentum has continued to build to now over 24,000 registered developers. As we announced at CES, we are looking forward to adding more features including support for CDMA. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 33% to $4.8 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, below our guidance of 23% to 24%, due primarily to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5 billion of shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends, continuing to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In summary, it was a strong quarter both for our product momentum, as well as for our financial results. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year."

At the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to various surveys, enterprise IT spend is forecast to grow in 2011, and Windows 7 and Office 2010 remained among the highest priorities for CIOs. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our share of the IT spending market. 
We expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. In terms of PC growth, we expect business to outpace consumer and emerging markets to outpace developed markets. With that backdrop, let me turn to segment expectations. 
Windows division revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC market for the third quarter and the full year when excluding the revenue attributable to the prior year launch spike and Tech Guarantee. As we said previously, when looking at year-over-year growth, you should exclude $100 million from Q3 of fiscal 2010 for the launch spike. And for full fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $700 million of revenue for the launch and $300 million for the Tech Guarantee. 
Moving on to Server & Tools. From Q3 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue, approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multi-year licensing revenue, which is about 50% of the total and enterprises services the remaining 20%, should grow high-single-digits for the third quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. 
Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rates for the third quarter and the fiscal year due to the Office 2010 launch. We expect revenue associated with multi-year agreements representing approximately 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single-digits for the third quarter and the fiscal year. When updating your models, remember that in Q3 of fiscal 2010, we deferred approximately $300 million related to the Office Tech Guarantee. 
Moving on to our Online Services division. While we feel great about the progress we have made with the partnership, we recognize that there has been some market place disruption. We are working diligently to address any issues, and we expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually over the next several quarters. We expect online advertising revenue, including organic revenue and new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership, to outperform the overall online advertising market in Q3 and for the full fiscal year. When updating your models, keep in mind that roughly 75% of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net of traffic acquisition costs. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, including the Kinect Sensor, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 50% for the third quarter and roughly 40% for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to cost of goods sold. As was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of the Entertainment and Devices division. Xbox consoles and Kinect Sensors have higher COGS than the rest of our products, and due to our growth expectations for these products, we remind you to consider this impact in your models. 
Turning to operating expenses. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion and our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we expect honored revenue to rapidly follow historic seasonal patterns. 
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the strong financial performance and continued product innovation we delivered this quarter. Heading into calendar year 2011, our product portfolio has never been stronger, and this combined with our continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities,  will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

I think we saw some macro things on the consumer side but business remains very strong, and I don't think that played a big part in it."

But probably even the stronger driver, especially now in the conversations, is the ability to more quickly take advantage of the latest capabilities that we have. Though it's a very easy way to deploy the latest versions of our software and increasingly, that's really the biggest piece of the dialogue. And for that, on the Azure side, the conversation's really about moving up from thinking about infrastructure-as-a-service to platform as a service and what they get with Azure in terms of management and security and sort of the developer ecosystem.

I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results.

I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results. Business and consumer response to our latest wave of innovation, including Office 2010 and Kinect, helped drive yet another quarter of healthy revenue growth, resulting in revenue of nearly $20 billion. 
Our solid revenue performance, combined with cost controls and continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities, enabled us to deliver record earnings per share and our sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion. 
On our last earnings call, I commented that we were looking forward to an exciting holiday quarter, especially from consumers. Kinect, in particular, exceeded our expectation. The controller-free entertainment experience is revolutionizing the living room. Kinect is the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history. We couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished. But importantly, it's just our first step in delivering on the opportunity to fundamentally change the way people interact with technology. 
The Microsoft Business Division also had a terrific quarter. Office 2010 is the most successful consumer version we have ever shipped, and the product is also performing extremely well in the Business segment. Companies are purchasing Office 2010 as well as our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange and Lync. 
Businesses are also deploying Windows 7. According to IDC, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have already started their formal migrations to Windows 7. 
In addition to healthy enterprise deployment of our Business Desktop products, we saw a strong momentum for our business infrastructure offerings. Windows Server and SQL Server premium revenues grew double digits, and this quarter marks the one year anniversary of Windows Server 2008 R2. Since its launch, we have grown our share of the overall server market every quarter. 
During the quarter, we continued our product launch momentum. In November, we delivered Microsoft Lync 2010, a next-generation communications platform that incorporates instant messaging, presence, audio, video, Web conferencing and voice into one interface that integrates with the applications businesses are already using today, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Exchange. 
For the consumer, I already mentioned Kinect. Also during the quarter, we launched Windows Phone 7, which is now on nine devices with 60 operators in 30 markets. We said all along that our first priority was to make a phone people love, and to that end, we're pleased with the initial response. Customer satisfaction data indicates 93% of customers worldwide are happy with the product, and we're also seeing strong developer engagement. While we're encouraged by the early progress, we realize we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we remain focused and committed to the long-term success of Windows Phone 7. 
We continued to deliver sustained innovation and releases for Bing. In addition to transitioning Yahoo!'s paid search in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook. Bing now provides much more personalized experiences by allowing users to bring their Facebook friends into their Search experiences. 
So in summary, our record performance for this quarter rounded out a very successful calendar year for Microsoft. We delivered strong financial results and invigorated the market with our product innovation. With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results."

I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year.

I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year. The deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability. We've reconciled the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless I specify otherwise. 
Okay, now to our results. This quarter's performance continued the momentum we've seen over the past year. Total revenue for the company was up 15% to nearly $20 billion. Operating income grew 20% and earnings per share grew 28%. Bookings grew 21%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit bookings growth. 
We continue to see strong momentum with Windows 7. As Peter mentioned, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have started their formal migrations to Windows 7 and many have already recognized material savings as a result. 
Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 for the equivalent period following launch. Office clearly remains the world's most popular productivity platform for both home and work. 
We've experienced an incredible consumer response to our latest products. Kinect, in particular, was the hottest gift this holiday season and has been mentioned by a number of publications as the most innovative product of 2010. 
Businesses of all sizes continued to commit to Microsoft's platforms. This quarter, we saw a better-than-expected increase in transactional licensing and Enterprise Agreements renewed in the historical range. 
Our unearned revenue balance grew 7% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. On a sequential basis, after adjusting for the $224 million of Office Tech Guarantee recognition, our unearned revenue balance declined $278 million. Our contracted-not-billed balance grew to over $16.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the prior quarter. This growth in our customer's multiyear commitment, combined with our strong transactional sales, resulted in a solid 21% growth in year-over-year bookings. Geographically, emerging markets continued to outperform mature markets. 
Now turning to the PC market, we estimate close to 90 million PCs were sold globally, the biggest quarter ever, representing growth of 2% to 4%. Business PCs grew faster than consumer PCs as companies continued to refresh hardware and has opt to Windows 7. Within consumer PCs, netbooks declined from their peak last year while notebook growth remained healthy. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted that there would be a $600 million headwind to Windows comparables for the second quarter due to the Windows 7 launch spike last year. Adjusting for this dynamic and the prior-year Tech Guarantee recognition, Windows and Windows Live revenue growth was in line with the PC market. 
As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The revenue per license benefit from a higher business mix was offset by emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. 
This quarter marks the one-year anniversary of Windows 7. Today, we are announcing that we have sold over 300 million Windows 7 licenses to date, continuing its momentum as the fastest-selling operating system in history. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC and Windows 7 ecosystem as seen at CES. The PC hardware dynamics are incredibly strong, with innovation in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including tablets, plates and convertibles. The new Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Fusion chip architectures substantially improved performance, graphics and battery life. 
In addition, we announced at CES that the next version of Windows will support System on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems form partners NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments and x86-based systems from partners Intel and AMD. Windows on System on a Chip architectures will fuel significant innovation across a spectrum of devices. We are enthusiastic about the future of device innovation and the role Windows is playing. 
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth. Non-annuity revenue grew roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew high-single-digits. Multi-year license revenue growth was roughly 11% and Enterprise Services revenue grew 9%. In the data center, we continue to be pleased with our progress in virtualization and systems management. The virtualization trend is driving double-digit System Center and Windows Server premium revenue growth while significantly lowering our customers' costs. In the database, premium offerings are also a core focus of our strategy, and this quarter, we saw a double-digit growth in SQL Server premium revenue. 
Among other customer wins this quarter, Dollar Thrifty Auto Group migrated their mission-critical pricing system from Oracle to a Microsoft data management solution, a strategic move that supports the company's goal to standardize on high-value cost-effective technologies. We are excited about SQL Server and our opportunity to drive Tier 1 customer wins. 
In the cloud, we continued to see developer interest and application development on the Windows Azure platform. Earlier in the quarter at PDC, we unveiled a number of additional platform enhancement and showed how leading companies like Pixar Animation Studios and ADP with NVoicePay were able to develop innovative solutions with Azure. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division which grew 19%. Online advertising revenue, including both Search and Display, grew 23% and now includes revenue-driven by our Search partnership with Yahoo!, which is implemented in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter. We continue to make progress on the partnership, and earlier this month, we transitioned to algorithmic search traffic in Mexico, Brazil and Australia. 
Bing's U.S. market share continued to grow, ending the quarter at 12% and our Search revenue growth rate again outperformed the market leader. 
During the quarter, we announced the significant expansion of our partnership with Facebook, where Bing will provide more personalized experiences by allowing users to Search Facebook profiles and incorporate their friend's like into search results. We believe the addition of these new social features is another way to deliver innovation and valuable enhancements to the Bing experience. 
Next, I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which continues to show solid launch momentum with revenue growing 24%. This includes $224 million of recognized revenue pertaining to the Office Tech Guarantee. We've seen enthusiastic consumer response to Office 2010 and business demand has also been strong with the transactional components of MBD sales up over 40%. The multi-year licensing portion of the business grew 9%. CIOs are investing in the new productivity scenarios enabled by SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM, which are enhanced when deployed with Office 2010. 
Lync grew over 20% this quarter while SharePoint 2010 and Dynamics CRM both continue to grow double digits. This quarter, we reported a number of cloud productivity wins, including the State University of New York, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, DuPont and the state of California among others. We have seen an immediate customer and partner response to the Office 365 announcement, with the beta oversubscribed within its first day. 
Just two weeks ago, we launched Dynamics CRM online in 40 markets. We're already seeing customers switching from Salesforce.com to Dynamics CRM online. It saves money, it's more flexible and it's easy to use with the familiar Microsoft Office experience for increased productivity.
Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 55% and operating income has now surpassed $1 billion year-to-date, which is a major milestone for this division. Kinect exceeded all expectations with 8 million stand-alone and bundled sensors sold in just 60 days. And since we updated the consoles last June, Xbox 360 has had tremendous momentum. We sold a record 6.3 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 21%. This helped drive Xbox Live membership up 30% to 30 million active members. 
In addition, at CES, we announced a number of upcoming feature enhancements, including Kinect support for Netflix, Hulu Plus and Avatar Kinect, which will advance how people communicate and enjoy their television experiences. 
Windows Phone 7 is off to a solid start as handset manufacturers purchased over 2 million licenses in the quarter. Windows Phone 7 is making progress in its early days as user satisfaction is extremely high, and developer momentum has continued to build to now over 24,000 registered developers. As we announced at CES, we are looking forward to adding more features including support for CDMA. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 33% to $4.8 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, below our guidance of 23% to 24%, due primarily to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5 billion of shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends, continuing to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In summary, it was a strong quarter both for our product momentum, as well as for our financial results. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to various surveys, enterprise IT spend is forecast to grow in 2011, and Windows 7 and Office 2010 remained among the highest priorities for CIOs. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our share of the IT spending market. 
We expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. In terms of PC growth, we expect business to outpace consumer and emerging markets to outpace developed markets. With that backdrop, let me turn to segment expectations. 
Windows division revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC market for the third quarter and the full year when excluding the revenue attributable to the prior-year launch spike and Tech Guarantee. As we said previously, when looking at year-over-year growth, you should exclude $100 million from Q3 of fiscal 2010 for the launch spike. And for full fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $700 million of revenue for the launch and $300 million for the Tech Guarantee. 
Moving on to Server & Tools. From Q3 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue, approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multi-year licensing revenue, which is about 50% of the total and enterprises services the remaining 20%, should grow high-single-digits for the third quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. 
Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rates for the third quarter and the fiscal year due to the Office 2010 launch. We expect revenue associated with multi-year agreements representing approximately 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single-digits for the third quarter and the fiscal year. When updating your models, remember that in Q3 of fiscal 2010, we deferred approximately $300 million related to the Office Tech Guarantee. 
Moving on to our Online Services division. While we feel great about the progress we have made with the partnership, we recognize that there has been some market place disruption. We are working diligently to address any issues, and we expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually over the next several quarters. We expect online advertising revenue, including organic revenue and new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership, to outperform the overall online advertising market in Q3 and for the full fiscal year. When updating your models, keep in mind that roughly 75% of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net of traffic acquisition costs. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, including the Kinect Sensor, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 50% for the third quarter and roughly 40% for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to cost of goods sold. As was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of the Entertainment and Devices division. Xbox consoles and Kinect Sensors have higher COGS than the rest of our products, and due to our growth expectations for these products, we remind you to consider this impact in your models. 
Turning to operating expenses. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion and our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns. 
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the strong financial performance and continued product innovation we delivered this quarter. Heading into calendar year 2011, our product portfolio has never been stronger, and this combined with our continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities,  will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

And so what we're seeing is strong contracted not billed, strong transactional reflected the bookings growth that Bill talked about.

And so what you're seeing is largely those two things offsetting each other."

I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results. Business and consumer response to our latest wave of innovation, including Office 2010 and Kinect, helped drive yet another quarter of healthy revenue growth, resulting in revenue of nearly $20 billion. 
Our solid revenue performance, combined with cost controls and continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities, enabled us to deliver record earnings per share and our sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion.
On our last earnings call, I commented that we were looking forward to an exciting holiday quarter, especially from consumers. Kinect, in particular, exceeded our expectation. The controller-free entertainment experience is revolutionizing the living room. Kinect is the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history. We couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished. But importantly, it's just our first step in delivering on the opportunity to fundamentally change the way people interact with technology.
The Microsoft Business Division also had a terrific quarter. Office 2010 is the most successful consumer version we have ever shipped, and the product is also performing extremely well in the Business segment. Companies are purchasing Office 2010 as well as our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange and Lync. Businesses are also deploying Windows 7. According to IDC, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have already started their formal migrations to Windows 7.
In addition to healthy enterprise deployment of our Business Desktop, we saw a strong momentum for our business infrastructure offerings. Windows Server and SQL Server premium revenues grew double digits, and this quarter marks the one year anniversary of Windows Server 2008 R2. Since its launch, we have grown our share of the overall server market every quarter.
During the quarter, we continued our product launch momentum. In November, we delivered Microsoft Lync 2010, a next-generation communications platform that incorporates instant messaging, presence, audio, video, Web conferencing and voice into one interface that integrates with the applications businesses are already using today, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Exchange.
For the consumer, I already mentioned Kinect. Also during the quarter, we launched Windows Phone 7, which is now on nine devices with 60 operators in 30 markets. We said all along that our first priority was to make a phone people love, and to that end, we're pleased with the initial response. Customer satisfaction data indicates 93% of customers worldwide are happy with the product, and we're also seeing strong developer engagement. While we're encouraged by the early progress, we realize we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we remain focused and committed to the long-term success of Windows Phone 7.
We continue to deliver sustained innovation and releases for Bing. In addition to transitioning Yahoo!'s paid search in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook. Bing now provides much more personalized experiences by allowing users to bring their Facebook friends into their Search experiences.
So in summary, our record performance for this quarter rounded out a very successful calendar year for Microsoft. We delivered strong financial results and invigorated the market with our product innovation.
With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results."

I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year. The deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability. We've reconciled the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless I specify otherwise.
Okay, now to our results. This quarter's performance continued the momentum we've seen over the past year. Total revenue for the company was up 15% to nearly $20 billion. Operating income grew 20% and earnings per share grew 28%. Bookings grew 21%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit bookings growth.
We continue to see strong momentum with Windows 7. As Peter mentioned, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have started their formal migrations to Windows 7 and many have already recognized material savings as a result.
Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 for the equivalent period following launch. Office clearly remains the world's most popular productivity platform for both home and work.
We've experienced an incredible consumer response to our latest products. Kinect, in particular, was the hottest gift this holiday season and has been mentioned by a number of publications as the most innovative product of 2010.
Businesses of all sizes continued to commit to Microsoft's platforms. This quarter, we saw a better-than-expected increase in transactional licensing and Enterprise Agreements renewed in the historical range.
Our unearned revenue balance grew 7% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. On a sequential basis, after adjusting for the $224 million of Office Tech Guarantee recognition, our unearned revenue balance declined $278 million. Our contracted-not-billed balance grew to over $16.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the prior quarter. This growth in our customer's multiyear commitment, combined with our strong transactional sales, resulted in a solid 21% growth in year-over-year bookings. Geographically, emerging markets continued to outperform mature markets.
Now turning to the PC market, we estimate close to 90 million PCs were sold globally, the biggest quarter ever, representing growth of 2% to 4%. Business PCs grew faster than consumer PCs as companies continued to refresh hardware and has opt to Windows 7. Within consumer PCs, netbooks declined from their peak last year while notebook growth remained healthy.
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted that there would be a $600 million headwind to Windows comparables for the second quarter due to the Windows 7 launch spike last year. Adjusting for this dynamic and the prior-year Tech Guarantee recognition, Windows and Windows Live revenue growth was in line with the PC market.
As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The revenue per license benefit from a higher business mix was offset by emerging markets growing faster than developed market.
This quarter marks the one-year anniversary of Windows 7. Today, we are announcing that we have sold over 300 million Windows 7 licenses to date, continuing its momentum as the fastest-selling operating system in history.
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC and Windows 7 ecosystem as seen at CES. The PC hardware dynamics are incredibly strong, with innovation in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including tablets, plates and convertibles. The new Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Fusion chip architectures substantially improved performance, graphics and battery life.
In addition, we announced at CES that the next version of Windows will support System on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems form partners NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments and x86-based systems from partners Intel and AMD. Windows on System on a Chip architectures will fuel significant innovation across a spectrum of devices. We are enthusiastic about the future of device innovation and the role Windows is playing.
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth. Non-annuity revenue grew roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew high-single-digits. Multi-year license revenue growth was roughly 11% and Enterprise Services revenue grew 9%. In the data center, we continue to be pleased with our progress in virtualization and systems management. The virtualization trend is driving double-digit System Center and Windows Server premium revenue growth while significantly lowering our customers' costs. In the database, premium offerings are also a core focus of our strategy, and this quarter, we saw a double-digit growth in SQL Server premium revenue.
Among other customer wins this quarter, Dollar Thrifty Auto Group migrated their mission-critical pricing system from Oracle to a Microsoft data management solution, a strategic move that supports the company's goal to standardize on high-value cost-effective technologies. We are excited about SQL Server and our opportunity to drive Tier 1 customer wins.
In the cloud, we continued to see developer interest and application development on the Windows Azure platform. Earlier in the quarter at PDC, we unveiled a number of additional platform enhancement and showed how leading companies like Pixar Animation Studios and ADP with NVoicePay were able to develop innovative solutions with Azure.
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division which grew 19%. Online advertising revenue, including both Search and Display, grew 23% and now includes revenue-driven by our Search partnership with Yahoo!, which is implemented in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter. We continue to make progress on the partnership, and earlier this month, we transitioned to algorithmic search traffic in Mexico, Brazil and Australia.
Bing's U.S. market share continued to grow, ending the quarter at 12% and our Search revenue growth rate again outperformed the market leader.
During the quarter, we announced the significant expansion of our partnership with Facebook, where Bing will provide more personalized experiences by allowing users to Search Facebook profiles and incorporate their friend's like into search results. We believe the addition of these new social features is another way to deliver innovation and valuable enhancements to the Bing experience.
Next, I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which continues to show solid launch momentum with revenue growing 24%. This includes $224 million of recognized revenue pertaining to the Office Tech Guarantee. We've seen enthusiastic consumer response to Office 2010 and business demand has also been strong with the transactional components of MBD sales up over 40%. The multi-year licensing portion of the business grew 9%. CIOs are investing in the new productivity scenarios enabled by SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM, which are enhanced when deployed with Office 2010.
Lync grew over 20% this quarter while SharePoint 2010 and Dynamics CRM both continue to grow double digits. This quarter, we reported a number of cloud productivity wins, including the State University of New York, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, DuPont and the state of California among others. We have seen an immediate customer and partner response to the Office 365 announcement, with the beta oversubscribed within its first day.
Just two weeks ago, we launched Dynamics CRM online in 40 markets. We're already seeing customers switching from Salesforce.com to Dynamics CRM online. It saves money, it's more flexible and it's easy to use with the familiar Microsoft Office experience for increased productivity.
Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 55% and operating income has now surpassed $1 billion year-to-date, which is a major milestone for this division. Kinect exceeded all expectations with 8 million stand-alone and bundled sensors sold in just 60 days. And since we updated the consoles last June, Xbox 360 has had tremendous momentum. We sold a record 6.3 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 21%. This helped drive Xbox Live membership up 30% to 30 million active members.
In addition, at CES, we announced a number of upcoming feature enhancements, including Kinect support for Netflix, Hulu Plus and Avatar Kinect, which will advance how people communicate and enjoy their television experiences.
Windows Phone 7 is off to a solid start as handset manufacturers purchased over 2 million licenses in the quarter. Windows Phone 7 is making progress in its early days as user satisfaction is extremely high, and developer momentum has continued to build to now over 24,000 registered developers. As we announced at CES, we are looking forward to adding more features including support for CDMA.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 33% to $4.8 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, below our guidance of 23% to 24%, due primarily to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5 billion of shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends, continuing to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In summary, it was a strong quarter both for our product momentum, as well as for our financial results.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to various surveys, enterprise IT spend is forecast to grow in 2011, and Windows 7 and Office 2010 remained among the highest priorities for CIOs. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our share of the IT spending market.
We expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. In terms of PC growth, we expect business to outpace consumer and emerging markets to outpace developed markets. With that backdrop, let me turn to segment expectations.
Windows division revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC market for the third quarter and the full year when excluding the revenue attributable to the prior-year launch spike and Tech Guarantee. As we said previously, when looking at year-over-year growth, you should exclude $100 million from Q3 of fiscal 2010 for the launch spike. And for full fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $700 million of revenue for the launch and $300 million for the Tech Guarantee.
Moving on to Server & Tools. From Q3 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue, approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multi-year licensing revenue, which is about 50% of the total and enterprise services the remaining 20%, should grow high-single-digits for the third quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year.
Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rates for the third quarter and the fiscal year due to the Office 2010 launch. We expect revenue associated with multi-year agreements representing approximately 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single-digits for the third quarter and the fiscal year. When updating your models, remember that in Q3 of fiscal 2010, we deferred approximately $300 million related to the Office Tech Guarantee.
Moving on to our Online Services division. While we feel great about the progress we have made with the partnership, we recognize that there has been some market place disruption. We are working diligently to address any issues, and we expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually over the next several quarters. We expect online advertising revenue, including organic revenue and new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership, to outperform the overall online advertising market in Q3 and for the full fiscal year. When updating your models, keep in mind that roughly 75% of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net of traffic acquisition costs.
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, including the Kinect Sensor, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 50% for the third quarter and roughly 40% for the full fiscal year.
Switching to cost of goods sold. As was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of the Entertainment and Devices division. Xbox consoles and Kinect Sensors have higher COGS than the rest of our products, and due to our growth expectations for these products, we remind you to consider this impact in your models.
Turning to operating expenses. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion and our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns.
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the strong financial performance and continued product innovation we delivered this quarter. Heading into calendar year 2011, our product portfolio has never been stronger, and this combined with our continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities,  will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

So in addition to just the beta being oversubscribed, it's not part of the conversations we're having with all of our customers. And it's one of those things where it's going to happen and the exact sort of speed of the ramp is uncertain. I do believe that once it starts to accelerate, it's going to accelerate pretty fast."

The talk about sort of the applications, the Office 365 types of services. People are very interested in that for two reasons. One, ultimately, if the economics are very good for them once they migrate over. But probably even the stronger driver, especially now in the conversations, is the ability to more quickly take advantage of the latest capabilities that we have. So it's a very easy way to deploy the latest versions of our software and increasingly, that's really the biggest piece of the dialogue. And for that, on the Office 365 side, on the Azure side, the conversation's really about moving up from thinking about infrastructure-as-a-service to platform-as-a-service and what they get with Azure in terms of management and security and sort of the developer ecosystem. So that's really what excites them in talking about the platform of the service of Azure, if you will."

This quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, reflecting strong business and consumer demand for our products and services. Despite a mixed PC environment, the breadth and depth of our portfolio drove another quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. 
On the commercial side, we saw strong multiyear licensing commitments by enterprises and robust transactional sales, particularly to small and medium businesses. Let me give more color on this. 
On the Business Desktop, customers continued to embrace our offering. Not only is Office 2010 the fastest-selling version of Office in our company's history, but businesses are purchasing our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And with the recently released public beta of Office 365, the next generation of our cloud productivity service, we are enabling new scenarios that weren't viable in the past, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. 
Office 365 eases deployment for our customers while lowering their upfront costs and provides significantly better returns on investments. Enterprises are investing in our business infrastructure offerings, with a growing preference for our premium products. Windows Server, SQL Server and our management tools are enabling our customers to transform their data centers to be more efficient. 
Companies are reaping the benefits that Windows 7 brings, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, security and manageability. Enterprise deployment of Windows 7 have more than doubled over the past 6 months. While business PC shipments showed strength this quarter, consumer PCs declined. Within both segments, emerging markets continued to be an area of strong growth. 
As demonstrated by Bing's continued market share this launch, we've made great strides in relevancy and design and continue to transform search beyond just queries to test completion and decision-making. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with Bing, there is significant work ahead to improve the monetizations, the combined Yahoo! and Bing marketplace. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI but revenue per search is below our expectations. We have our best search technical leadership on this issue, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to improve monetization as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
Turning to our Entertainment and Devices Division, in November, we took the first step in creating a new mobile ecosystem by launching Windows Phone 7. In this quarter, we took the next step by entering into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. Together, Nokia and Microsoft will innovate with greater speed and provide enhanced opportunities for users and partners to share in the success of the new ecosystem. 
Consumers are delighted with Kinect, as well as our entire Xbox 360 platform for the evolutionary experience it brings to their living room. Kinect continues to be lead the way forward in gaming and is opening the door for new scenarios to take advantage of natural user interface. 
In summary, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with prioritization of investments and our continued focus on operating expense management, allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong financial result. 
With that, I'm going to hand it over to Bill to provide more detail on this quarter's results.  And then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year."
21835,129184187,119296,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Microsoft Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%.

Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record $8.7 billion or growth of 17%. Operating cash flow year-to-date had surpassed $21 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion. Many of the demand trends in the third quarter were similar to the first half of the year. Specifically, Office 2010, Xbox and Xbox LIVE and Kinect continue to enjoy exceptional consumer momentum. 
On the commercial side, enterprise demand for our products remains strong. Businesses are deploying Microsoft platforms and applications, including Windows, Windows Server, Office, Dynamics and Management Tools. The business demand is translating into healthy increases in transactional licensing and strong Enterprise Agreement visuals. Our and revenue balance grew 6% to $13 billion, reflecting continued strength in our commercial customer's multiyear commitment. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $17 billion, growing approximately 20%. Bookings for the company were up 8%. 
Now let me turn to the PC market. There are 3 trends we are observing. First, business PC growth was 9% this quarter. The business PC refresh cycle continues and is still in the early stages. Second, emerging markets continues to play a larger role in total PC shipment volume and now represent nearly half of all worldwide PC shipments. Finally, the consumer PC markets declined 8% as there are several dynamics at work, including a 40% decline in netbooks, broader consumer macroeconomic, increased competition for consumer spending and the strength of Windows 7 consumer PCs in the prior year. In total, we estimate the PC market decline 1% to 3% in the third quarter. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted there would be a $100 million headwind to Windows comparables for the third quarter due to the prior year Windows 7 launch. Adjusting for this dynamic, Windows revenue was in line with the PC market as we guided. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. 
To summarize, the PC industry dynamics have continuing strength from emerging market offset by a benefit of a higher business mix and improved attach. 
Since the launch of Windows 7, customer satisfaction and market reception have been terrific, and we have more opportunities ahead. While Windows 7 has now sold over 350 million units since launch, an estimated 75% of the PC installed base is still running older operating systems. The number of PCs running Windows 7 in the enterprise has more than doubled over the past 6 months, and volume licensing has strengthened. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC market with Windows 7. There's innovation occurring in new ultraportables, all-in-one and other form factors, including slates and convertibles which are starting to hit the market now. This quarter, we also released Windows in Tune, a cloud-based subscription service that will help businesses manage and secure Windows PCs. Windows in Tune provides significant opportunities for Microsoft and our partners to further expand our reach, grow our revenue and delight customers. With Windows in Tune, we have an opportunity to bring even more customers to the cloud. 
During the quarter, we launched the latest version of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9 utilizes the power and performance of the whole PC to provide users with a faster, more immersive web experience. With new features such as hardware accelerated graphics, support for HTML 5 and integrated Windows 7 navigation, websites act more like applications on IE9. And just a few weeks after releasing IE9, we released the platform preview of IE 10, which will deliver innovation for the next generation of web experience powered by Windows. 
Now I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which excluding the prior year Office Tech Guarantee deferral, grew 13%. We continue to see terrific response to the release from both consumers and businesses. Adjusted for the prior year deferral, consumer revenue grew 26%, with increased Office attached to PCs. The business transactional portion grew 28%, also driven by improved attach rate, post-launch and higher business PC shipments. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 5%. 
Businesses are deploying Office 2010, along with Windows 7 on the corporate desktop. Office 2010 deployment rate is 5x faster than the deployment of Office 2007. Importantly, businesses are also attaching the Office Server applications, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync, which all grew double digits this quarter. 
Lync grew 30%, and we are seeing tremendous reception for the product. As we have discussed previously, Unified Communications is a huge growth opportunity, and Lync offers an immediate return on investment to CIOs.
Last Monday, we released the public beta of Office 365, and we continue to see momentum in business online services. The number of customers using our services has quadrupled since last year. Over 50% of our customers are small businesses, but we're also seeing large enterprises, governmental and educational institutions moving to the cloud. This quarter, we announced large customer wins, including Shell Oil, General Hospital, Advocate Healthcare and Manpower, among others. 
Our Dynamics business grew 10%, with both Dynamics ERP and Dynamics CRM increasing account penetration. In the third quarter, we launched Dynamics CRM 2011, and we are seeing great traction with 40,000 businesses already in product trial, a significant pipeline to our current 27,000 customer base. 
We also recently announced that the next release of Dynamics ERP will be cloud-enabled. We are delivering world-class business applications on premise and in the cloud that are simple, agile and deliver more values than competitive offerings. 
Now let's turn to Server & Tools, which posted 11% revenue growth. Server & Tools had strong performance across the entire product portfolio. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single-digits. 
Multiyear license revenue grew 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%. In the data center, we continue to increase the penetration and monetization of Windows Server and System Center. We saw strong Enterprise Agreement renewals of Windows Server this quarter and premium revenue was up double digits. 
System Center, our management offering, grew double digits for the 10th consecutive quarter. 
Hyper V continues to win new business and establish new performance benchmarks on key workloads. This quarter, we showcased a large customer win, with Target Corporation. Target is running business-critical workloads for all 1,700 retail stores using Microsoft virtualization and management technologies. 
In the database, SQL Server unit volumes and ASPs were up, with a shift toward our premium editions. SQL premium revenue has now grown double digits for 4 consecutive quarters as customers adopt higher-level capabilities such as business intelligence.
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong momentum and developer interest. This quarter, we announced the strategic partnership with Toyota, who will be using Windows Azure for its enterprise-grade scalable platform to provide advanced telematics services. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services Division, which grew 14%. Online advertising revenue, including both search and display, grew 17%. 
Bing's U.S. market share continue to grow, ending the quarter at 13.9%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter and almost 600 basis points since launch. We feel great about the pace of innovation and customer satisfaction with our differentiated approach to search. However, the expensive monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing search marketplace in the U.S. and Canada is taking longer than planned, and revenue per share remains below our expectations.  
We have delayed our international integration efforts to focus on improvements in the U.S. and Canada.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices Division, where revenue grew an impressive 60%. Xbox has been setting the pace in the gaming industry this fiscal year. With Kinect recognized as the fastest-selling consumer electronics product ever, we sold an additional 2.4 million sensors this post-holiday quarter. We also shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles, a new third quarter record that surpasses the previous high by 1 million units.
Xbox Live also continues to increase its contribution to our customer experience and ED's financial performance. We again saw healthy increases in transactional revenue, which continues to exceed subscription revenue.
Turning to Windows Phone. Product reviews are good. Customer satisfaction is high, well above 90%, and we have shown a clear strategy for enabling a vibrant ecosystem around Windows Phone. This quarter, we took the next step and entered into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. While we have enjoyed strong developer support to date with more than 13,000 applications, we've noted even greater developer interest subsequent to the Nokia alliance announcement.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 41% this quarter due to 3 primary factors: One, volume-driven costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party contract royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox LIVE. 
Two, as I mentioned in the Server & Tools performance, our Enterprise Services business is growing rapidly. Costs in this business are largely volume driven.  
And three, online services costs are up from increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. 
Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was below our guidance, due primarily to the $461 million one-time benefit related to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased $827 million of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. Year-to-date, we returned $13.9 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, 33% more than the previous year.
In summary, it was a very solid quarter with strong financial results.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook."

The remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high-level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2012. From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter may be similar to the third quarter. 
In the PC market, we've seen that growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets and growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs. As a result, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with the PC market for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, continued to exceed PC shipment growth rate, and at a moderating rate as we approach the Office 2010 launch anniversary. Revenue associated with multiyear licensing agreements, representing approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single-digits. 
Turning to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. The Business division, we expect transactional revenue to generally track at the hardware market, and multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low-double-digits. 
Within OSD, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with overall online advertising market. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 25% for the fourth quarter. Shifting to cost of goods sold, as was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of Entertainment and Devices, Enterprise Services and integration and traffic acquisition costs associated with our search business. 
Turning to operating expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for fiscal year 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Revenue will follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to our next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal 2012. The PC market dynamics I discussed for Q4, emerging markets outpacing developed markets and business outpacing consumer should also continue through the next fiscal year. While we expect ongoing healthy demand for Office 2010, we expect more difficult year-over-year comparables for the Microsoft Business Division. 
For Server & Tools, we expect to continue to outpace the server market due to our premium offerings and product portfolio. Within our search business, we expect to see revenue per search improvements over the course of the calendar year. 
Lastly, we expect momentum within our Entertainment and Devices division to continue. 
Moving on to Cost of Goods Sold, as was the case in fiscal 2011, the most important factor to consider will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. We expect fiscal year 2012 operating expenses to grow 3% to 5% from the midpoint of our fiscal 2011 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending to manage our expenses. Based on this growth range, we expect fiscal 2012 operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our healthy financial results for the quarter. As we look forward into the next fiscal year, our robust product portfolio and ongoing focus on cost management will enable us to continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

This quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, reflecting strong business and consumer demand for our products and services. Despite a mixed PC environment, the breadth and depth of our portfolio drove another quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. 
On the commercial side, we saw strong multiyear licensing commitments by enterprises and robust transactional sales, particularly to small and medium businesses. Let me give more color on these. 
On the business desktop, customers continued to embrace our offering. Not only is Office 2010 the fastest-selling version of Office in our company's history, but businesses are purchasing our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And with the recently released public beta of Office 365, the next generation of our cloud productivity service, we are enabling new scenarios that weren't viable in the past, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. Office 365 eases deployment for our customers while lowering their upfront costs and provides significantly better returns on investment. 
Enterprises are investing in our business infrastructure offerings, with a growing preference for our premium products. Windows Server, SQL Server and our management tools are enabling our customers to transform their data centers to be more efficient. 
Companies are reaping the benefits that Windows 7 brings, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, security and manageability. Enterprise deployments of Windows 7 have more than doubled over the past 6 months. While business PC shipments showed strength this quarter, consumer PCs declined. Within both segments, emerging markets continued to be an area of strong growth. 
As demonstrated by Bing's continued market share gains since its launch, we have made great strides in relevancy and design and continue to transform search beyond just queries to task completion and decision making. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with Bing, there is significant work ahead to improve the monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing marketplace. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but revenue per search is below our expectations. We have our best search technical leadership on this issue, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to improve monetization as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
Turning to our Entertainment and Devices division, in November, we took the first step in creating a new mobile ecosystem by launching Windows Phone 7. In this quarter, we took the next step by entering into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. Together, Nokia and Microsoft will innovate with greater speed and provide enhanced opportunities for users and partners to share in the success of the new ecosystem. 
Consumers are delighted with Kinect, as well as our entire Xbox 360 platform for the revolutionary experience it brings to their living room. Kinect continues to lead the way forward in gaming and is opening the door for new scenarios to take advantage of natural user interface. 
So in summary, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with prioritization of investments and our continued focus on operating expense management, allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong financial results. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results. And then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year."
21835,129184187,119383,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Microsoft Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and our sixth con",1695,"Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record $8.7 billion or growth of 17%. Operating cash flow year-to-date had surpassed $21 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion. Many of the demand trends in the third quarter were similar to the first half of the year. Specifically, Office 2010, Xbox and Xbox Live and Kinect continue to enjoy exceptional consumer momentum. 
On the commercial side, enterprise demand for our products remains strong. Businesses are deploying Microsoft platforms and applications, including Windows, Windows Server, Office, Dynamics and Management Tools. The business demand is translating into healthy increases in transactional licensing and strong enterprise agreement renewals. Our unearned revenue balance grew 6% to $13 billion, reflecting continued strength in our customers' multiyear commitment. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $17 billion, growing approximately 20%. Bookings for the company were up 8%. 
Now let me turn to the PC market. There are 3 trends we are observing. First, business PC growth was 9% this quarter. The business PC refresh cycle continues and is still in the early stages. Second, emerging markets continues to play a larger role in total PC shipment volume and now represent nearly half of all worldwide PC shipments. 
Finally, the consumer PC markets declined 8% as there are several dynamics at work, including a 40% decline in netbooks, broader consumer macroeconomics, increased competition for consumer spending and the strength of Windows 7 consumer PCs in the prior year. In total, we estimate the PC market declined 1% to 3% in the third quarter. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted there would be a $100 million headwind to Windows comparables for the third quarter due to the prior year Windows 7 launch. Adjusting for this dynamic, Windows revenue was in line with the PC market as we guided. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. 
To summarize, the PC industry dynamics of continuing strength from emerging markets offset the benefits of a higher business mix and improved attach. 
Since the launch of Windows 7, customer satisfaction and market reception have been terrific, and we have more opportunities ahead. While Windows 7 has now sold over 350 million units since launch, an estimated 75% of the PC installed base is still running older operating systems. The number of PCs running Windows 7 in the enterprise has more than doubled over the past 6 months, and volume licensing has strengthened. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC market with Windows 7. There is innovation occurring in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including slates and convertibles, which are starting to hit the market now. 
This quarter, we also released Windows Intune, a cloud-based subscription service that will help businesses manage and secure Windows PCs. Windows Intune provides significant new opportunities for Microsoft and our partners to further expand our reach, grow our revenue and delight customers. With Windows Intune, we have an opportunity to bring even more customers to the cloud. 
During the quarter, we launched the latest version of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9 utilizes the power and performance of the whole PC to provide users with a faster, more immersive web experience. With new features, such as hardware-accelerated graphics, support for HTML 5 and integrated Windows 7 navigation, websites act more like applications on IE9. And just a few weeks after releasing IE9, we released the platform preview of IE 10, which will deliver innovation for the next generation of web experiences powered by Windows. 
Now I'll move to the Microsoft Business division, which excluding the prior year Office Tech Guarantee deferral, grew 13%. We continue to see terrific response to the release from both customers -- from both consumers and businesses. Adjusted for the prior year deferral, consumer revenue grew 26%, with increased Office attached to PCs. The business transactional portion grew 28%, also driven by improved attach rates, postlaunch and higher business PC shipments. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 5%. 
Businesses are deploying Office 2010, along with Windows 7 on the corporate desktop. Office 2010 deployment rate is 5x faster than the deployment of Office 2007. Importantly, businesses are also attaching the Office Server applications: SharePoint, Exchange and Lync, which all grew double digits this quarter. 
Lync grew 30%, and we are seeing tremendous reception for the product. As we have discussed previously, Unified Communications is a huge growth opportunity, and Lync offers an immediate return on investment to CIOs.
Last Monday, we released the public beta of Office 365, and we continue to see momentum in business Online Services. The number of customers using our services has quadrupled since last year. Over 50% of our customers are small businesses, but we're also seeing large enterprises, governmental and educational institutions moving to the cloud. This quarter, we announced large customer wins, including Shell Oil, Tampa General Hospital, Advocate Healthcare and Manpower, among others. 
Our Dynamics business grew 10%, with both Dynamics ERP and Dynamics CRM increasing account penetration. In the third quarter, we launched Dynamics CRM 2011, and we are seeing great traction with 40,000 businesses already in product trial, a significant pipeline to our current 27,000 customer base. 
We also recently announced that the next release of Dynamics ERP will be cloud enabled. We are delivering world-class business applications on premise and in the cloud that are simple, agile and deliver more values than competitive offering. 
Now let's turn to Server and Tools, which posted 11% revenue growth. Server and Tools had strong performance across the entire product portfolio. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. 
Multiyear license revenue grew 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%. In the data center, we continue to increase the penetration and monetization of Windows Server and System Center. We saw strong Enterprise Agreement renewals of Windows Server this quarter and premium revenue was up double digits. 
System Center, our management offering, grew double digits for the 10th consecutive quarter. Hyper-V continues to win new business and establish new performance benchmarks on key workloads. This quarter, we showcased a large customer win, with Target Corporation. Target is running business-critical workloads for all 1,700 retail stores using Microsoft virtualization and management technologies. 
In the database, SQL Server unit volumes and ASPs were up, with a shift toward our premium editions. SQL premium revenue has now grown double digits for 4 consecutive quarters as customers adopt higher level capabilities, such as business intelligence.
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong momentum and developer interest. This quarter, we announced the strategic partnership with Toyota, who will be using Windows Azure for its enterprise-grade, scalable platform to provide advanced telematics services. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 14%. Online advertising revenue, including both search and display, grew 17%. 
Bing's U.S. market share continue to grow, ending the quarter at 13.9%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter and almost 600 basis points since launch. We feel great about the pace of our innovation and customer satisfaction with our differentiated approach to search. However, the expensive monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing search marketplace in the U.S. and Canada is taking longer than planned, and revenue per share remains below our expectations. We have delayed our international integration efforts to focus on improvements in the U.S. and Canada.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew an impressive 60%. Xbox has been setting the pace in the gaming industry this fiscal year. With Kinect recognized as the fastest selling consumer electronics product ever, we sold an additional 2.4 million sensors this postholiday quarter. We also shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles, a new third quarter record that surpasses the previous high by 1 million units.
Xbox Live also continues to increase its contribution to our customer experience and E&D's financial performance. We again saw healthy increases in transactional revenue, which continues to exceed subscription revenue.
Turning to Windows Phone. Product reviews are good. Customer satisfaction is high, well above 90%. And we have shown a clear strategy for enabling a vibrant ecosystem around Windows Phone. This quarter, we took the next step and entered into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. While we have enjoyed strong developer support to date with more than 13,000 applications, we've noted even greater developer interest subsequent to the Nokia alliance announcement.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 41% this quarter due to 3 primary factors: one, volume driven costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Two, as I mentioned in the Server and Tools performance, our Enterprise Services business is growing rapidly. Costs in this business are largely volume driven. And three, Online Services costs are up from increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4%. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was below our guidance, due primarily to the $461 million onetime benefit related to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased $827 million of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned $13.9 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, 33% more than the previous year.
In summary, it was a very solid quarter with strong financial results.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2012. 
From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter will be similar to the third quarter. In the PC market, we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets and growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs. As a result, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with the PC market for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rate, but at a moderating rate as we approach the Office 2010 launch anniversary. Revenue associated with multiyear licensing agreements, representing approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single digits. 
Turning to Server and Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. Within this division, we expect transactional revenue to generally track at the hardware market, and multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low double digits. Within OSD, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 25% for the fourth quarter. 
Switching to cost of goods sold, as was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of Entertainment and Devices, Enterprise Services and integration and traffic acquisition costs associated with our search business. 
Turning to operating expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for fiscal year 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to our next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal 2012. The PC market dynamics I discussed for Q4, emerging markets outpacing developed markets and business outpacing consumer should also continue through the next fiscal year. While we expect ongoing healthy demand for Office 2010, we expect more difficult year-over-year comparables for the Microsoft Business division. 
For Server and Tools, we expect to continue to outpace the server market due to our premium offerings and product portfolio. Within our search business, we expect to see revenue per search improvements over the course of the calendar year. 
Lastly, we expect momentum within our Entertainment and Devices division to continue. 
Moving on to Cost of Goods Sold, as was the case in fiscal 2011, the most important factor to consider will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. We expect fiscal year 2012 operating expenses to grow 3% to 5% from the midpoint of our fiscal 2011 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses. Based on this growth range, we expect fiscal 2012 operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our healthy financial results for the quarter. As we look forward into the next fiscal year, our robust product portfolio and ongoing focus on cost management will enable us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions."

This quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, reflecting strong business and consumer demand for our products and services. Despite a mixed PC environment, the breadth and depth of our portfolio drove another quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. 
On the commercial side, we saw strong multiyear licensing commitments by enterprises and robust transactional sales, particularly to small and medium businesses. Let me give more color on these. 
On the business desktop, customers continued to embrace our offering. Not only is Office 2010 the fastest-selling version of Office in our company's history, but businesses are purchasing our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And with the recently released public beta of Office 365, the next generation of our cloud productivity service, we are enabling new scenarios that weren't viable in the past, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. Office 365 eases deployment for our customers while lowering their upfront costs and provides significantly better returns on investment. 
Enterprises are investing in our business infrastructure offerings, with a growing preference for our premium products. Windows Server, SQL Server and our management tools are enabling our customers to transform their data centers to be more efficient. 
Companies are reaping the benefits that Windows 7 brings, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, security and manageability. Enterprise deployments of Windows 7 have more than doubled over the past 6 months. While business PC shipments showed strength this quarter, consumer PCs declined. Within both segments, emerging markets continued to be an area of strong growth. 
As demonstrated by Bing's continued market share gains since its launch, we have made great strides in relevancy and design and continue to transform search beyond just queries to task completion and decision making. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with Bing, there is significant work ahead to improve the monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing marketplace. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but revenue per search is below our expectations. We have our best search technical leadership on this issue, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to improve monetization as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
Turning to our Entertainment and Devices division, in November, we took the first step in creating a new mobile ecosystem by launching Windows Phone 7. In this quarter, we took the next step by entering into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. Together, Nokia and Microsoft will innovate with greater speed and provide enhanced opportunities for users and partners to share in the success of the new ecosystem. 
Consumers are delighted with Kinect, as well as our entire Xbox 360 platform for the revolutionary experience it brings to their living room. Kinect continues to lead the way forward in gaming and is opening the door for new scenarios to take advantage of natural user interface. 
So in summary, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with prioritization of investments and our continued focus on operating expense management, allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong financial results. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results. And then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year."
21835,129184187,119433,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Microsoft Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%.

Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record $8.7 billion or growth of 17%. Operating cash flow year-to-date has surpassed $21 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion. Many of the demand trends in the third quarter were similar to the first half of the year. Specifically, Office 2010, Xbox and Xbox Live and Kinect continue to enjoy exceptional consumer momentum. 
On the commercial side, enterprise demand for our products remains strong. Businesses are deploying Microsoft platforms and applications, including Windows, Windows Server, Office, Dynamics and Management Tools. The business demand is translating into healthy increases in transactional licensing and strong enterprise agreement renewals. Our unearned revenue balance grew 6% to $13 billion, reflecting continued strength in our customers' multiyear commitment. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $17 billion, growing approximately 20%. Bookings for the company were up 8%. 
Now let me turn to the PC market. There are 3 trends we are observing. First, business PC growth was 9% this quarter. The business PC refresh cycle continues and is still in the early stages. Second, emerging markets continues to play a larger role in total PC shipment volume and now represent nearly half of all worldwide PC shipments. 
Finally, the consumer PC market declined 8% as there are several dynamics at work, including a 40% decline in netbooks, broader consumer macroeconomics, increased competition for consumer spending and the strength of Windows 7 consumer PCs in the prior year. In total, we estimate the PC market declined 1% to 3% in the third quarter. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted there would be a $100 million headwind to Windows comparables for the third quarter due to the prior year Windows 7 launch. Adjusting for this dynamic, Windows revenue was in line with the PC market as we guided. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. 
To summarize, the PC industry dynamics of continuing strength from emerging markets offset the benefits of a higher business mix and improved attach. 
Since the launch of Windows 7, customer satisfaction and market reception have been terrific, and we have more opportunities ahead. While Windows 7 has now sold over 350 million units since launch, an estimated 75% of the PC installed base is still running older operating systems. The number of PCs running Windows 7 in the enterprise has more than doubled over the past 6 months, and volume licensing has strengthened. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC market with Windows 7. There is innovation occurring in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including slates and convertibles, which are starting to hit the market now. 
This quarter, we also released Windows Intune, a cloud-based subscription service that will help businesses manage and secure Windows PCs. Windows Intune provides significant new opportunities for Microsoft and our partners to further expand our reach, grow our revenue and delight customers. With Windows Intune, we have an opportunity to bring even more customers to the cloud. 
During the quarter, we launched the latest version of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9 utilizes the power and performance of the whole PC to provide users with a faster, more immersive web experience. With new features, such as hardware-accelerated graphics, support for HTML 5 and integrated Windows 7 navigation, websites act more like applications on IE9. And just a few weeks after releasing IE9, we released the platform preview of IE 10, which will deliver innovation for the next generation of web experiences powered by Windows. 
Now I'll move to the Microsoft Business division, which excluding the prior year Office Tech Guarantee deferral, grew 13%. We continue to see terrific response to the release from both consumers and businesses. Adjusted for the prior year deferral, consumer revenue grew 26%, with increased Office attach to PCs. The business transactional portion grew 28%, also driven by improved attach rates, postlaunch and higher business PC shipments. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 5%. 
Businesses are deploying Office 2010, along with Windows 7 on the corporate desktop. Office 2010 deployment rate is 5x faster than the deployment of Office 2007. Importantly, businesses are also attaching the Office Server applications: SharePoint, Exchange and Lync, which all grew double digits this quarter. 
Lync grew 30%, and we are seeing tremendous reception to the product. As we have discussed previously, Unified Communications is a huge growth opportunity, and Lync offers an immediate return on investment to CIOs.
Last Monday, we released the public beta of Office 365, and we continue to see momentum in business Online Services. The number of customers using our services has quadrupled since last year. Over 50% of our customers are small businesses, but we're also seeing large enterprises, governmental and educational institutions moving to the cloud. This quarter, we announced large customer wins, including Shell Oil, Tampa General Hospital, Advocate Healthcare and Manpower, among others. 
Our Dynamics business grew 10%, with both Dynamics ERP and Dynamics CRM increasing account penetration. In the third quarter, we launched Dynamics CRM 2011, and we are seeing great traction with 40,000 businesses already in product trial, a significant pipeline to our current 27,000 customer base. 
We also recently announced that the next release of Dynamics ERP will be cloud enabled. We are delivering world-class business applications on premise and in the cloud that are simple, agile and deliver more values than competitive offering. 
Now let's turn to Server and Tools, which posted 11% revenue growth. Server and Tools had strong performance across the entire product portfolio. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. 
Multiyear license revenue grew 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%. In the data center, we continue to increase the penetration and monetization of Windows Server and System Center. We saw strong Enterprise Agreement renewals of Windows Server this quarter and premium revenue was up double digits. 
System Center, our management offering, grew double digits for the 10th consecutive quarter. Hyper-V continues to win new business and establish new performance benchmarks on key workloads. This quarter, we showcased a large customer win, with Target Corporation. Target is running business-critical workloads for all 1,700 retail stores using Microsoft virtualization and management technologies. 
In the database, SQL Server unit volumes and ASPs were up, with a shift toward our premium editions. SQL's premium revenue has now grown double digits for 4 consecutive quarters as customers adopt higher level capabilities, such as business intelligence.
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong momentum and developer interest. This quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Toyota, who will be using Windows Azure for its enterprise-grade, scalable platform to provide advanced telematics services. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 14%. Online advertising revenue, including both search and display, grew 17%. 
Bing's U.S. market share continue to grow, ending the quarter at 13.9%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter and almost 600 basis points since launch. We feel great about the pace of our innovation and customer satisfaction with our differentiated approach to search. However, the expected monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing search marketplace in the U.S. and Canada is taking longer than planned, and revenue per share remains below our expectations. We have delayed our international integration efforts to focus on improvements in the U.S. and Canada.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew an impressive 60%. Xbox has been setting the pace in the gaming industry this fiscal year. With Kinect recognized as the fastest selling consumer electronics product ever, we sold an additional 2.4 million sensors this postholiday quarter. We also shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles, a new third quarter record that surpasses the previous high by 1 million units.
Xbox Live also continues to increase its contribution to our customer experience and E&D's financial performance. We again saw healthy increases in transactional revenue, which continues to exceed subscription revenue.
Turning to Windows Phone. Product reviews are good. Customer satisfaction is high, well above 90%. And we have shown a clear strategy for enabling a vibrant ecosystem around Windows Phone. This quarter, we took the next step and entered into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. While we have enjoyed strong developer support to date with more than 13,000 applications, we've noted even greater developer interest subsequent to the Nokia alliance announcement.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 41% this quarter due to 3 primary factors: one, volume driven costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Two, as I mentioned in the Server and Tools performance, our Enterprise Services business is growing rapidly. Costs in this business are largely volume driven. And three, Online Services costs are up from increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4%. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was below our guidance, due primarily to the $461 million onetime benefit related to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased $827 million of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned $13.9 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, 33% more than the previous year.
In summary, it was a very solid quarter with strong financial results.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2012. 
From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter will be similar to the third quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets and growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs. As a result, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with the PC market for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rate, but at a moderating rate as we approach the Office 2010 launch anniversary. Revenue associated with multiyear licensing agreements, representing approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single digits. 
Turning to Server and Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. Within this division, we expect transactional revenue to generally track at the hardware market, and multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low double digits. Within OSD, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 25% for the fourth quarter. 
Switching to cost of goods sold, as was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of Entertainment and Devices, Enterprise Services and integration and traffic acquisition costs associated with our search business. 
Turning to operating expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for fiscal year 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to our next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal 2012. The PC market dynamics I discussed for Q4, emerging markets outpacing developed markets and business outpacing consumer should also continue through the next fiscal year. While we expect ongoing healthy demand for Office 2010, we expect more difficult year-over-year comparables for the Microsoft Business division. 
For Server and Tools, we expect to continue to outpace the server market due to our premium offerings and product portfolio. Within our search business, we expect to see revenue per search improvements over the course of the calendar year. 
Lastly, we expect momentum within our Entertainment and Devices division to continue. 
Moving on to Cost of Goods Sold, as was the case in fiscal 2011, the most important factor to consider will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. We expect fiscal year 2012 operating expenses to grow 3% to 5% from the midpoint of our fiscal 2011 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses. Based on this growth rate, we expect fiscal 2012 operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our healthy financial results for the quarter. As we look forward into the next fiscal year, our robust product portfolio and ongoing focus on cost management will enable us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions."

Secondly, Enterprise Services, which is volume-driven, and they are having nice growth, so that shows up in COGS. And then finally in Online Services, some costs associated with the Yahoo! alliance. As you know, some of that revenue that we get from that alliance from the Yahoo! property gets tacked out in COGS and some other traffic acquisition costs. Those were the 3 big drivers of the COGS growth, all volume driven."

I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, identified as further to our commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. 
Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7 where our enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. 
As I look back on the fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that would allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenue double digits, and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. 
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. 
We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat, while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront costs.  And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. 
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. 
At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. 
In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationships with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined Search marketplace. 
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. 
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its network platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we'll increase the accessibility of realtime video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. 
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances, which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012."

First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details of the 5 business segments. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion,",1298,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details of the 5 business segments. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion, a growth of 12%. 
Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. 
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our honored revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. 
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs representing 1/2 of all global PC shipments were shipped to emerging markets. 
We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increase of 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. 
Last week on at our Worldwide Partner Conference we announced that we have sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. 
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our Build Developer Conference this September. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued lifecycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. 
We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow at double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on the Dynamics CRM and now 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM everyday. 
Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single-digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double-digits 10 consecutive quarters. 
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. 
Lastly, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at Build in September. 
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerated. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by Search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social grasp to help people make better, smarter decisions.  As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forces of War, Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. 
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB, and this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. 
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone.  Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. 
During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. 
Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling related costs. 
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the one-time benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. 
In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook."
21835,137176239,144266,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Microsoft Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. For emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, the impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and at higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single-digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Turning to the Online Services division, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high-single-digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double-digits over this fiscal year. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

And we've got great momentum in the marketplace with the console which we've refreshed a year ago, with Kinect which just came to market last holiday, with a bunch of new content titles that Bill talked about in terms of games as well as broader entertainment content. So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the market place, you'll see the strategy really coming together in that business, selling the installed base of the console and then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio.  And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business. Additionally, I mean I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the surface of the possibility with both the Xbox console and Kinect.

They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means. Now we integrate not only the great new Office applications but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently communications with Lync.  And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses.  And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, we're taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across-the-board whether that's with the premium version of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementation on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there. So the combination of a really strong environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across-the-board from infrastructure to applications has been great."

So it's a very deliberate plan. They're engaged in testing. In many cases, I think we talked about that last quarter but not so much this quarter. They're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 Desktop. So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a lot of opportunity for the future.

So the dynamics that we saw this past quarter, we see playing out again next year, and that will drive the unearned growth for the full year. I would add and I talked about this a little earlier but I'll go back to it again. The conversations increasing that we're having with the cloud, whether that's Office 365 our Windows Azure or Windows Intune or Dynamics CRM Online really play into that as well because we find increasingly customers wanting to make long-term commitments when they see that migration path to the cloud as well.  And that you'll see coming down even more play this year."

I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, as enterprises furthered to our commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. 
As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenue double digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. 
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. 
We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront cost. And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. 
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. 
At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. 
In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace. 
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. 
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its networked platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. 
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012."

Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion, growth of 12%. 
Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter, and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. 
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our unearned revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. 
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs, representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets. We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. 
Last week on at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we had sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. 
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD developer conference this September. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. 
We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on the Dynamics CRM. And now, 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM everyday. 
Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters. 
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. 
Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at BUILD in September. 
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter decisions.  As Peter mentioned, we continued to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forces of War, Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. 
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB. And this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. 
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone.  Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling-related costs. 
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the onetime benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. 
In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Turning to the Online Services division, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high-single-digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch, and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double digits over this fiscal year. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business. Additionally -- I mean, I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the surface of the possibilities with both the Xbox console and Kinect.

One, the business refresh has continued as companies have come out of the economic downturn of a few years ago. They really are investing in technology. They're seeing the opportunities for technology to really enhance their value proposition. And they are seeing the benefit of our technology. They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means and how we integrate not only the great new Office applications, but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses.  And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, in taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementations on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there. So the combination of a really strong environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across the board, from infrastructure to applications, has been great."

In many cases, I think we talked about that last quarter, but not so much this quarter, they're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 Desktop. So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a lot of opportunity for the future.

For enterprises who need much more scalability, who need premium versions, they can pay a little bit more.

I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, as enterprises furthered their commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. 
As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenues double digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. 
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. 
We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront cost. And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. 
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. 
In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace. 
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. 
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its networked platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. 
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012."

Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion, growth of 12%. 
Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter, and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. 
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our unearned revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not-billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. 
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs, representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets. We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. 
Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we had sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. 
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD developer conference this September. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. 
We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on Dynamics CRM, and now, 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM every day. 
Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters. 
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. 
Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at BUILD in September. 
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter decisions.  As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forza 4 [sic] [Forza Motorsport 4], Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. 
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB. And this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. 
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone.  Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling-related costs. 
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the onetime benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. 
In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Turning to the Online Services division. We expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high single digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch, and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double-digits over this fiscal year. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the marketplace, you see the strategy really coming together in that business, selling the installed base of the consoles and then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio. And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business.

One, the business refresh has continued as companies have come out of the economic downturn of a few years ago. They really are investing in technology. They're seeing the opportunities for technology to really enhance their value proposition. And they are seeing the benefit of our technology. They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means and how we integrate, not only the great new Office applications, but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses.  And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, in taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementations on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there. So the combination of a really strong environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across the board, from infrastructure to applications, has been great."

On the enterprise side, clearly, companies like JPMorgan have started looking at Windows 7 and working on the deployment plan. When we think about the term ""committed"", it means that either a Microsoft sales rep or a partner actually have plans in place where they're looking at a rollout schedule. So it's a very deliberate plan. They're engaged in testing. In many cases, I think we talked about that last quarter, but not so much this quarter, they're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 Desktop. So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a lot of opportunity for the future. And I think to your point probably, enterprises are a little bit further along just due to the -- probably the macroeconomic environment. And we've seen more deliberate execution there than maybe in some of the other areas. That's a great question."

I would add, and I talked about this a little earlier but I'll go back to it again, the conversations increasingly that we're having with the cloud, whether that's Office 365 or Windows Azure or Windows Intune or Dynamics CRM Online, really play into that as well because we find increasingly, customers wanting to make long-term commitments when they see that migration path to the cloud as well.

I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, as enterprises furthered their commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. 
As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenues double digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. 
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. 
We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront cost. And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. 
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. 
In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace. 
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. 
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its networked platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. 
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012."

Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter, and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. 
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our unearned revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not-billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. 
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs, representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets. We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. 
Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we had sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. 
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD developer conference this September. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. 
We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on Dynamics CRM, and now, 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM every day. 
Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters. 
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. 
Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at BUILD in September. 
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter decisions.  As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forza 4 [sic] [Forza Motorsport 4], Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. 
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB. And this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. 
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone.  Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling-related costs. 
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the onetime benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. 
In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."
21835,137176239,144554,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Microsoft Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our busi",656,"Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Turning to the Online Services division. We expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high single digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch, and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double-digits over this fiscal year. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions."

So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the marketplace, you see the strategy really coming together in that business, selling the installed base of the consoles and then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio. And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business. Additionally -- I mean, I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the surface of the possibilities with both the Xbox console and Kinect.

They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means and how we integrate, not only the great new Office applications, but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses.  And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, in taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementations on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there.

Today, I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter financial results. We've started fiscal year 2012 with good momentum. We have great products in market, customer satisfaction is high and we have important strategic investments and alliances to position us well for long-term growth. 
This quarter, we saw revenue growth across all of our segments. Similar to prior periods, we continue to see broad-based demand across geographies, including Europe. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division continued its momentum with revenue of $5.6 billion, growth of 8%. 
Despite the best efforts of competitors, Office remains the overwhelming choice for productivity, evolving with our customers and posting impressive revenues. We are extremely pleased by the market reception to Office 2010 this far into the launch cycle. We're 15 months post-launch, but we still saw an increase in the consumer PC attach rate for Office this quarter. 
And for businesses, Office 2010 remains a top priority. Just as important, businesses are also adopting our productivity server applications, including Lync, SharePoint and Exchange, either on-premise or in the cloud with Office 365. The early success of Office 365 has surpassed our expectations. Businesses around the world and of all sizes are making the commitment to Microsoft's cloud services. 
Our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center, are a top priority for enterprises. The flexibility, performance, scalability and price advantage of our private cloud products uniquely meet the needs of the market. And with Windows Azure, we enable our customers to build new applications and extend their existing private cloud assets to the public cloud. 
As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting, we are increasingly delivering integrated experiences across multiple devices from the phone, to the Xbox and TV and to the PC. Earlier this month, we launched an updated version of our Windows Phone operating system with a broad array of new features and services, including enhanced integration with Bing, Xbox Live and Office 365. With Nokia, Samsung and other devices coming to market, we are well positioned to become the third mobile ecosystem. 
In the living room, we continue to differentiate the entertainment experience for Xbox users around the world, and we recently announced partnerships with nearly 40 leading TV and entertainment providers. Powered by Kinect and Voice Search through Bing, users will be able to easily search and enjoy content from a large collection of content providers through their Xbox 360 consoles. 
And on the PC, Windows 7 is the operating system of choice for almost half a billion people around the world. Combined with the innovative hardware being brought to market by our OEM partners this holiday season, Windows will continue to deliver the great experiences that people want. 
During the quarter, we unveiled the developer preview of the next version of our PC operating system. Windows 8 creates a modern platform designed for a new generation of hardware experiences, enabled by touch and a diversity of chip architectures. 
In Search, monetization of our ad platforms remains below our expectations, and we continue to partner closely with Yahoo! to address the platform gaps and inefficiencies. We recently agreed to extend the RPS guaranteed payments to Yahoo!, reflecting the strength of our partnership and our continued commitment and optimism about the financial opportunity ahead of us. 
Last week, we reached a significant milestone with the closing of our acquisition of Skype. We welcome Skype employees into the Microsoft family, and we welcome the over 170 million people who rely on Skype with their voice and video calls on a monthly basis. Now that the deal is closed, we're starting the integration of Skype's world-class services and global network platform across our portfolio products and services, including Lync, Windows Live messenger, Windows Phone and the Xbox platform. Together, we will redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world. 
In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Customer demand across the breadth of our product portfolio was healthy, and we remain focused on our strategic investments and partnerships that will help drive future growth. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide some more details in our results."

First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year.

Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.68, an increase of 10%. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income during the quarter. Coming off a record Q4, enterprise demand for our products remains strong, and our customers continue to add both products and seats to their Enterprise Agreements. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.7 billion, and our contracted not build remained over $18.5 billion. 
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the overall market grew 1% to 3%. Within that, PC sales to emerging markets continued to outpace developed markets. Business PCs grew 5% to a quarterly record of almost 35 million PCs. And consumer PCs were flat, primarily impacted by weakness in netbook sales. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was up 2% and grew in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, the Windows business continued to show momentum. During the quarter, we surpassed 450 million copies of Windows 7 sold since launch, and enterprise deployments of Windows 7 progressed. This quarter, OEM licenses grew 4%, and within that, business licenses grew 6%. 
While we have seen the cannibalization of netbooks, sales of Windows licenses on traditional consumer PCs showed healthy growth of 14%. 
As we look toward the holiday season, we are particularly excited about the lineup of impressive ultrabooks that will be in market from our OEM partners. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 8%. Consumer revenue increased 7% despite difficult comps from the year ago launch of Office 2010. The business transactional portion grew 3%, driven by strong attach in developed markets, partially offset by the impact of PC geographical market mix. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. 
Collaboration and communication continued to be a pillar of strength to our Office business. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew over 25% as customers increasingly chose Microsoft for their voice and video rollouts. We are focused on the opportunities in this large and growing market. 
With Skype's highly engaged users spending an average of 125 minutes per month, we're particularly excited about the role Skype can play in connecting individuals and businesses together with voice and video. 
Last quarter, we announced the launch of Office 365, the latest version of our cloud-based productivity platform. We are thrilled with the early results. In the first 10 weeks of Office 365 availability, the number of new customers exceeded what took us over 2 years to build with the first version of our business productivity online service. 
Also, we've seen Office 365 customers buy more products and drive new revenue streams. For example, when we've won a competitive bid on the enterprise for messaging and e-mail, 80% of the new customers have bought SharePoint and Lync, in addition to Exchange. 
And historically, small businesses have only bought Office. But today with Office 365, 80% of the time, we've seen them buy the bundle of SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools which posted 10% revenue growth and grew faster than the server market. Our multiyear license revenue continued to perform well and grew double digits this quarter. Enterprise Services revenue was up 17%. 
Windows Server Premium and System Center revenues grew midteens as the buildout of private cloud environments and the virtualization of data centers has increased server density and has shifted buying behaviors toward our premium enterprise offering. 
Our data platform business also continued to perform well. SQL Server premium revenue grew nearly 20% this quarter as customers increasingly look to SQL Server to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workload. 
We continue to build on our strong Server & Tools portfolio. At our BUILD Developer Conference in September, we took the wraps off Windows Server 8, the next major release of the world's most used server operating system, which will be cloud-optimized to work in both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. 
In addition, we highlighted our data platform with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012. We also announced our plans to support Apache Hadoop, both on Windows Azure and Windows Server to embrace big data. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division where revenue grew 19%. Online advertising revenue was up nearly 21%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.7%, up 30 basis points this quarter and 350 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, when they progress in differentiating our offering by deepening social integration with Facebook and Twitter and made enhancements that simplify decision-making and path completion. 
While Online Services improved its year-over-year operating performance, we continued to face monetization challenges which we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices division where revenue grew 9%, and we continued our leadership of the U.S. console market. Gears of War 3, which is only available on Xbox, effectively kicked off the holiday season and sold 3 million units in its first week of release. Gaming is an important component of living room entertainment and in addition to blockbusters such as Forza 4, Dance Central 2, Halo Anniversary and Kinect Sports Season 2, there will be over 70 Kinect titles available for the holidays. 
Beyond gaming, next quarter is also when nearly 35 million Xbox Live users will begin to enjoy the new television content and experiences from our announced partnerships. 
During the quarter, we released the updated version of Windows Phone to market, and it has received favorable reviews from both industry press and our customers. We also signed a broad agreement with Samsung that includes increased collaboration on the development and marketing of Windows phones. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was driven by the following: First, we saw an increase in royalty costs resulting from strong transactional sales on Xbox Live and the increased sales of royalty-bearing Xbox 360 games, notably Gears of War 3. Second, Enterprise Services continue to grow rapidly; and third, online service costs increased, which included Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to compensation changes, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. 
In the first quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.20, an increase of 25%, and we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends. 
So in summary, we saw broad-based strength in our businesses and got off to a good start to the year, both in revenue and EPS. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who is going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live division. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced the past several quarters, with PC growth in emerging markets significantly outpacing growth in developed markets. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the second quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the prior-year launch impact. 
In addition, when updating your models, remember that last year, we recognized $224 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Tech Guarantee. 
Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single-digits for the second quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow about 20%. 
Turning to the Online Services division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business. Our #1 priority is to resolve the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are working very closely with Yahoo! on bridging the RPS gap. As we improve RPS, revenue should track the online advertising market more closely. 
Moving onto the Entertainment & Devices division. Including Skype, we now expect revenue to grow low double digits for the second quarter and high teens for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. We expect COGS growth to have similar dynamics to what we experienced the past 3 quarters. Growth will be driven by increased Xbox console sales, Xbox Live royalty costs, the inclusion of Skype, Enterprise Services and online costs, including Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. We have adjusted our fiscal year operating expense guidance to include Skype and the associated integration costs. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be $28.6 billion to $29.2 billion for the full fiscal year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the second quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. 
For the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year. 
As I discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation. Investing in growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We are investing in the significant growth opportunities we see for our businesses by building integrated products that deliver a differentiated value proposition and accelerating our growth in compelling scenarios like real-time communications with the acquisition of Skype. 
We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our dividend 25%, and we are continuing our $40 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in 2008, of which $11.2 billion remain. 
In summary, our financial results this quarter build upon an already strong financial foundation, one that provides stability while at the same time giving us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn back to Bill and we'll take some questions."

We've got folks here sort of in the building as we speak really working hard on what the plans are going to be, and so I think over time, it will become more clear. I think as we've been talking about since we announced the acquisition, the opportunities are incredibly exciting across the portfolio of our products, whether it's Lync or Windows Live messenger or Xbox or on the phone. And so I think not only are there great opportunities to integrate across our product portfolio but as they were working on even before we announced the acquisition, new revenue opportunities related to advertising and premium services. So all of that's coming together as we speak. And mostly, we're incredibly excited to get to work together more fully now that the deal has closed. In terms of your question about Thailand, first thing I want to say obviously is our thoughts go out to all the individuals that are affected there and we're thinking about them. In terms of the impact of that, you're correct, it doesn't impact solid-state which is good. And I would say this about the overall impact.

There's a couple of things going on, particularly in the enterprise that really provides sustenance for the ongoing business. One is the great sort of traction we get from the integration of SharePoint and Exchange and Lync with Office 2010. So not only is there really good resonance for the Office application but increasingly, as Bill talked about, customers are deploying communications and collaboration technology with that. And there's a lot of legs to go on productivity server applications piece of the business. Second thing I would add is the cloud. Increasingly, every time we go in and talk to enterprises about productivity, they want to have a conversation about public cloud services, not necessarily because they want to deploy public cloud tomorrow but they really want to understand the roadmap and understand where that's leading, and we found that creates an incredibly good conversation that then leads to a broader conversation of a long-term commitment to our platform and applications. And I think obviously, that's a long-term phenomenon but a lot of room still to go. So the way I think about it, yes, with the Office application particularly on the transactional side coming off of launch here, there's some difficult comparables.

Today, I’m pleased to share with you our first quarter financial results. We’ve started fiscal year 2012 with good momentum. We have great products in market, customer satisfaction is high, and we have important strategic investments and alliances that position us well for long-term growth. 
This quarter, we saw revenue growth across all of our segments. Similar to prior periods, we continued to see broad-based demand across geographies, including Europe. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division continued its momentum with revenue of $5.6 billion, growth of 8%. Despite the best efforts of competitors, Office remains the overwhelming choice for productivity, evolving with our customers and posting impressive revenues.  
We are extremely pleased by the market reception to Office 2010 this far into the launch cycle. We’re 15 months post-launch, but we still saw an increase in the consumer PC attach rate for Office this quarter. And, for businesses, Office 2010 remains a top priority. Just as important, businesses are also adopting our productivity server applications including Lync, SharePoint, and Exchange, either on-premise, or in the cloud with Office 365. The early success of Office 365 has surpassed our expectations. Businesses around the world, and of all sizes, are making the commitment to Microsoft’s cloud services. 
Our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V, and System Center, are a top priority for enterprises. The flexibility, performance, scalability, and price advantage of our private cloud products uniquely meet the needs of the market. And with Windows Azure, we enable our customers to build new applications and extend their existing private cloud assets to the public cloud.
As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting, we are increasingly delivering integrated experiences across multiple devices, from the phone, to the Xbox and TV, and to the PC. Earlier this month, we launched an updated version of our Windows Phone operating system with a broad array of new features and services, including enhanced integration with Bing, Xbox LIVE, and Office 365. With Nokia, Samsung and other devices coming to market, we are well positioned to become the third mobile ecosystem. 
In the living room, we continue to differentiate the entertainment experience for Xbox users around the world, and we recently announced partnerships with nearly 40 leading TV and entertainment providers. Powered by Kinect and voice search through Bing, users will be able to easily search and enjoy content from a large collection of content providers through their Xbox 360 consoles. And on the PC, Windows 7 is the operating system of choice for almost half a billion people around the world. Combined with the innovative hardware being brought to market by our OEM partners this holiday season, Windows will continue to deliver the great experiences that people want.  
During the quarter, we unveiled the developer preview of the next version of our PC operating system. Windows 8 creates a modern platform designed for a new generation of hardware experiences enabled by touch and the diversity of chip architectures. In Search, monetization of our ad platform remains below our expectations and we continue to partner closely with Yahoo! to address the platform gaps and inefficiencies. We recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee payments to Yahoo! reflecting the strength of our partnership, and our continued commitment and optimism about the financial opportunity ahead of us.
Last week, we reached a significant milestone with the closing of our acquisition of Skype. We welcome Skype employees into the Microsoft family. And, we welcome the over 170 million people who rely on Skype for their voice and video calls on a monthly basis. Now that the deal is closed, we are starting the integration of Skype’s world-class services and global-networked platform across our portfolio of products and services including Lync, Windows Live Messenger, Windows Phone, and the Xbox platform. Together, we will redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.
In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Customer demand across the breadth of our product portfolio was healthy and we remain focused on our strategic investments and partnerships that will help drive future growth. 
With that, I’m going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results."

First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operation",1171,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.68, an increase of 10%. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income during the quarter. Coming off a record Q4, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and our customers continue to add both products and seats to their enterprise agreements. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.7 billion, and our contracted not billed remained over $18.5 billion. 
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the overall market grew 1% to 3%. Within that, PC sales to emerging markets continued to outpace developed markets. Business PCs grew 5% to a quarterly record of almost 35 million PCs. And consumer PCs were flat, primarily impacted by weakness in netbook sales. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 2% and grew in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, the Windows business continued to show momentum. During the quarter, we surpassed 450 million copies of Windows 7 sold since launch, and enterprise deployments of Windows 7 progressed. This quarter, OEM licenses grew 4%, and within that, business licenses grew 6%. 
While we have seen the cannibalization of netbooks, sales of Windows licenses on traditional consumer PCs showed healthy growth of 14%. 
As we look towards the holiday season, we are particularly excited about the lineup of impressive Ultrabooks that will be in market from our OEM partners. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 8%. Consumer revenue increased 7% despite difficult comps from the year ago launch of Office 2010. The business transactional portion grew 3%, driven by strong attach in developed markets, partially offset by the impact of PC geographical market mix. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. 
Collaboration and communication continued to be a pillar of strength to our Office business. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew over 25% as customers increasingly chose Microsoft for their voice and video rollouts. We are focused on the opportunities in this large and growing market. 
With Skype's highly engaged users spending an average of 125 minutes per month, we're particularly excited about the role Skype can play in connecting individuals and businesses together with voice and video. 
Last quarter, we announced the launch of Office 365, the latest version of our cloud-based productivity platform. We are thrilled with the early results. In the first 10 weeks of Office 365 availability, the number of new customers exceeded what took us over 2 years to build with the first version of our business productivity online service. 
Also, we've seen Office 365 customers buy more products and drive new revenue streams. For example, when we've won a competitive bid on the enterprise for messaging and email, 80% of the new customers have bought SharePoint and Lync, in addition to Exchange. 
And historically, small businesses have only bought Office. But today with Office 365, 80% of the time, we've seen them buy the bundle of SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools which posted 10% revenue growth and grew faster than the server market. Our multiyear license revenue continued to perform well and grew double digits this quarter. Enterprise Services revenue was up 17%. 
Windows Server premium and System Center revenues grew mid-teens as the buildout of private cloud environments and the virtualization of data centers has increased server density and has shifted buying behaviors toward our premium enterprise offering. 
Our data platform business also continued to perform well. SQL Server premium revenue grew nearly 20% this quarter as customers increasingly look to SQL Server to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workloads. 
We continue to build on our strong Server & Tools portfolio. At our BUILD Developer Conference in September, we took the wraps off Windows Server 8, the next major release of the world's most used server operating system, which will be cloud-optimized to work in both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. 
In addition, we highlighted our data platform with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012. We also announced our plans to support Apache Hadoop, both on Windows Azure and Windows Server to embrace big data. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 19%. Online advertising revenue was up nearly 21%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.7%, up 30 basis points this quarter and 350 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, when may progress in differentiating our offering by deepening Bing's social integration with Facebook and Twitter and made enhancements that simplify decision-making and task-completion.
While Online Services improved its year-over-year operating performance, we continued to face monetization challenges which we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division where revenue grew 9%, and we continued our leadership of the U.S. console market. Gears of War 3, which is only available on Xbox, effectively kicked off the holiday season and sold 3 million units in its first week of release. Gaming is an important component of living room entertainment and in addition to blockbusters such as Forza 4, Dance Central 2, Halo Anniversary and Kinect Sports Season 2, there will be over 70 Kinect titles available for the holidays. 
Beyond gaming, next quarter is also when nearly 35 million Xbox LIVE users will begin to enjoy the new television content and experiences from our announced partnerships. 
During the quarter, we released the updated version of Windows Phone to market, and it has received favorable reviews from both industry press and our customers. We also signed a broad agreement with Samsung that includes increased collaboration on the development and marketing of Windows Phones. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was driven by the following: First, we saw an increase in royalty costs resulting from strong transactional sales on Xbox LIVE and the increased sales of royalty-bearing Xbox 360 games, notably Gears of War 3. Second, Enterprise Services continued to grow rapidly; and third, online service costs increased, which included Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to compensation changes, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. 
In the first quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.20, an increase of 25%, and we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
So in summary, we saw broad-based strength in our businesses and got off to a good start to the year, both in revenue and EPS. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we exper",621,"Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced in the past several quarters, with PC growth in emerging markets significantly outpacing growth in developed markets. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the second quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the prior-year launch impact. 
In addition, when updating your models, remember that last year, we recognized $224 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Tech Guarantee. 
Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow about 20%. 
Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business. Our #1 priority is to resolve the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are working very closely with Yahoo! on bridging the RPS gap. As we improve RPS, revenue should track the online advertising market more closely. 
Moving onto the Entertainment & Devices Division. Including Skype, we now expect revenue to grow low double digits for the second quarter and high teens for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. We expect COGS growth to have similar dynamics to what we experienced in the past 3 quarters. Growth will be driven by increased Xbox console sales, Xbox LIVE royalty costs, the inclusion of Skype, Enterprise Services and online costs, including Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. We have adjusted our fiscal year operating expense guidance to include Skype and the associated integration costs. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be $28.6 billion to $29.2 billion for the full fiscal year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the second quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. 
For the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year. 
As I discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation. Investing in growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We are investing in the significant growth opportunities we see for our businesses by building integrated products that deliver a differentiated value proposition and accelerating our growth in compelling scenarios like real-time communications with the acquisition of Skype. 
We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our dividend 25%, and we are continuing our $40 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in 2008, of which $11.2 billion remain. 
In summary, our financial results this quarter build upon an already strong financial foundation, one that provides stability while at the same time giving us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions."

We've got folks here sort of in the building as we speak really working hard on what the plans are going to be, and so I think over time, it will become more clear. I think as we've been talking about since we announced the acquisition, the opportunities are incredibly exciting across the portfolio of our products, whether it's Lync or Windows Live Messenger or Xbox or on the phone. And so I think not only are there great opportunities to integrate across our product portfolio but as they were working on even before we announced the acquisition, new revenue opportunities related to advertising and premium services, so all of that's coming together as we speak. And mostly, we're incredibly excited to get to work together more fully now that the deal has closed. In terms of your question about Thailand, first thing I want to say obviously is, our thoughts go out to all the individuals that are affected there and we're thinking about them. In terms of the impact of that, you're correct, it doesn't impact solid-state which is good. And I would say this about, overall, the impact.

There's a couple of things going on, particularly in the enterprise that really provides sustenance for the ongoing business. One is the great sort of traction we get from the integration of SharePoint and Exchange and Lync with Office 2010. So not only is there really good resonance for the Office application but increasingly, as Bill talked about, customers are deploying communications and collaboration technology with that. And there is a lot of legs to go on the productivity server applications piece of the business. Second thing I would add is the cloud. Increasingly, every time we go in and talk to enterprises about productivity, they want to have a conversation about public cloud services, not necessarily because they want to deploy public cloud tomorrow, but they really want to understand the roadmap and understand where that's leading, and we found that it creates an incredibly good conversation that then leads to a broader conversation of a long-term commitment to our platform and applications. And I think obviously, that's a long-term phenomenon but a lot of room still to go. So the way I think about it, yes, for the Office application, particularly on the transactional side, coming off of launch here, there's some difficult comparables. But on the enterprise side, with the additional products and the cloud, that's really been the driver of our growth and it is really a long-term catalyst."

Today, I’m pleased to share with you our first quarter financial results. We’ve started fiscal year 2012 with good momentum. We have great products in market, customer satisfaction is high, and we have important strategic investments and alliances to position us well for long-term growth. 
This quarter, we saw revenue growth across all of our segments. Similar to prior periods, we continued to see broad-based demand across geographies, including Europe. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division continued its momentum with revenue of $5.6 billion, growth of 8%. Despite the best efforts of competitors, Office remains the overwhelming choice for productivity, evolving with our customers and posting impressive revenues.  
We are extremely pleased by the market reception to Office 2010 this far into the launch cycle. We’re 15 months post-launch, but we still saw an increase in the consumer PC attach rate for Office this quarter. And, for businesses, Office 2010 remains a top priority. Just as important, businesses are also adopting our productivity server applications including Lync, SharePoint and Exchange, either on-premise or in the cloud with Office 365. The early success of Office 365 has surpassed our expectations. Businesses around the world, and of all sizes, are making the commitment to Microsoft’s cloud services. 
Our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center, are a top priority for enterprises. The flexibility, performance, scalability, and price advantage of our private cloud products uniquely meet the needs of the market. And with Windows Azure, we enable our customers to build new applications and extend their existing private cloud assets to the public cloud.
As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting, we are increasingly delivering integrated experiences across multiple devices, from the phone to the Xbox and TV and to the PC. Earlier this month, we launched an updated version of our Windows Phone operating system with a broad array of new features and services, including enhanced integration with Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365. With Nokia, Samsung and other devices coming to market, we are well positioned to become the third mobile ecosystem. 
In the living room, we continue to differentiate the entertainment experience for Xbox users around the world, and we recently announced partnerships with nearly 40 leading TV and entertainment providers. Powered by Kinect and voice search through Bing, users will be able to easily search and enjoy content from a large collection of content providers through their Xbox 360 consoles. And on the PC, Windows 7 is the operating system of choice for almost half a billion people around the world. Combined with the innovative hardware being brought to market by our OEM partners this holiday season, Windows will continue to deliver the great experiences that people want.  
During the quarter, we unveiled the developer preview of the next version of our PC operating system. Windows 8 creates a modern platform designed for a new generation of hardware experiences enabled by touch and a diversity of chip architectures. In Search, monetization of our ad platform remains below our expectations, and we continue to partner closely with Yahoo! to address the platform gaps and inefficiencies. We recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee payments to Yahoo! reflecting the strength of our partnership and our continued commitment and optimism about the financial opportunity ahead of us.
Last week, we reached a significant milestone with the closing of our acquisition of Skype. We welcome Skype employees into the Microsoft family. And we welcome the over 170 million people who rely on Skype for their voice and video calls on a monthly basis. Now that the deal is closed, we are starting the integration of Skype’s world-class services and global-networked platform across our portfolio of products and services including Lync, Windows Live Messenger, Windows Phone and the Xbox platform.  Together, we will redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.
In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Customer demand across the breadth of our product portfolio was healthy, and we remain focused on our strategic investments and partnerships that will help drive future growth. 
With that, I’m going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results."

First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operation",1171,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.68, an increase of 10%. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income during the quarter. Coming off a record Q4, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and our customers continued to add both products and seats to their enterprise agreements. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.7 billion, and our contracted not billed remained over $18.5 billion. 
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the overall market grew 1% to 3%. Within that, PC sales to emerging markets continued to outpace developed markets. Business PCs grew 5% to a quarterly record of almost 35 million PCs. And consumer PCs were flat, primarily impacted by weakness in netbook sales. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 2% and grew in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, the Windows business continued to show momentum. During the quarter, we surpassed 450 million copies of Windows 7 sold since launch, and enterprise deployments of Windows 7 progressed. This quarter, OEM licenses grew 4%, and within that, business licenses grew 6%. 
While we have seen the cannibalization of netbooks, sales of Windows licenses on traditional consumer PCs showed healthy growth of 14%. 
As we look towards the holiday season, we are particularly excited about the lineup of impressive Ultrabooks that will be in market from our OEM partners. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 8%. Consumer revenue increased 7%, despite difficult comps from the year ago launch of Office 2010. The business transactional portion grew 3%, driven by strong attach in developed markets, partially offset by the impact of PC geographical market mix. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. 
Collaboration and communication continued to be a pillar of strength to our Office business. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew over 25% as customers increasingly chose Microsoft for their voice and video rollouts. We are focused on the opportunities in this large and growing market. 
With Skype's highly engaged users spending an average of 125 minutes per month, we're particularly excited about the role Skype can play in connecting individuals and businesses together with voice and video. 
Last quarter, we announced the launch of Office 365, the latest version of our cloud-based productivity platform. We are thrilled with the early results. In the first 10 weeks of Office 365 availability, the number of new customers exceeded what took us over 2 years to build with the first version of our business productivity online service. 
Also, we've seen Office 365 customers buy more products and drive new revenue streams. For example, when we've won a competitive bid in the enterprise for messaging and email, 80% of the new customers have bought SharePoint and Lync, in addition to Exchange. 
And historically, small businesses have only bought Office. But today with Office 365, 80% of the time, we've seen them buy the bundle of SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth and grew faster than the server market. Our multiyear license revenue continued to perform well and grew double digits this quarter. Enterprise Services revenue was up 17%. 
Windows Server premium and System Center revenues grew mid-teens as the buildout of private cloud environments and the virtualization of data centers has increased server density and has shifted buying behaviors toward our premium enterprise offering. 
Our data platform business also continued to perform well. SQL Server premium revenue grew nearly 20% this quarter as customers increasingly look to SQL Server to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workloads. 
We continue to build on our strong Server & Tools portfolio. At our BUILD Developer Conference in September, we took the wraps off Windows Server 8, the next major release of the world's most used server operating system, which will be cloud-optimized to work in both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. 
In addition, we highlighted our data platform with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012. We also announced our plans to support Apache Hadoop, both on Windows Azure and Windows Server to embrace big data. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 19%. Online advertising revenue was up nearly 21%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.7%, up 30 basis points this quarter and 350 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, we made progress in differentiating our offering by deepening Bing's social integration with Facebook and Twitter and made enhancements that simplify decision-making and task-completion.
While Online Services improved its year-over-year operating performance, we continued to face monetization challenges which we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division where revenue grew 9%, and we continued our leadership of the U.S. console market. Gears of War 3, which is only available on Xbox, effectively kicked off the holiday season and sold 3 million units in its first week of release. Gaming is an important component of living room entertainment, and in addition to blockbusters such as Forza 4, Dance Central 2, Halo Anniversary and Kinect Sports Season 2, there will be over 70 Kinect titles available for the holidays. 
Beyond gaming, next quarter is also when nearly 35 million Xbox LIVE users will begin to enjoy the new television content and experiences from our announced partnerships. 
During the quarter, we released the updated version of Windows Phone to market, and it has received favorable reviews from both industry press and our customers. We also signed a broad agreement with Samsung that includes increased collaboration on the development and marketing of Windows Phones. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was driven by the following: First, we saw an increase in royalty costs resulting from strong transactional sales on Xbox LIVE and the increased sales of royalty-bearing Xbox 360 games, notably Gears of War 3. Second, Enterprise Services continued to grow rapidly. And third, online service costs increased, which included Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to compensation changes, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. 
In the first quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.20, an increase of 25%, and we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
So in summary, we saw broad-based strength in our businesses and got off to a good start to the year, both in revenue and EPS. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook."

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Divisions. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced in the past several quarters, with PC growth in emerging markets significantly outpacing growth in developed markets. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the second quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the prior-year launch impact. 
In addition, when updating your models, remember that last year, we recognized $224 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Tech Guarantee. 
Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow about 20%. 
Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business. Our #1 priority is to resolve the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are working very closely with Yahoo! on bridging the RPS gap. As we improve RPS, revenue should track the online advertising market more closely. 
Moving onto the Entertainment & Devices Division. Including Skype, we now expect revenue to grow low double digits for the second quarter and high teens for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. We expect COGS growth to have similar dynamics to what we experienced the past 3 quarters. Growth will be driven by increased Xbox console sales, Xbox LIVE royalty costs, the inclusion of Skype, Enterprise Services and online costs, including Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. We have adjusted our fiscal year operating expense guidance to include Skype and the associated integration costs. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be $28.6 billion to $29.2 billion for the full fiscal year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the second quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. 
For the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year. 
As I discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation: investing in growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We are investing in the significant growth opportunities we see for our businesses by building integrated products that deliver a differentiated value proposition and accelerating our growth in compelling scenarios like real-time communications with the acquisition of Skype. 
We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our dividend 25%, and we are continuing our $40 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in 2008, of which $11.2 billion remain. 
In summary, our financial results this quarter build upon an already strong financial foundation, one that provides stability while at the same time giving us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill, and we'll take some questions."

We've got folks here sort of in the building as we speak really working hard on what the plans are going to be, and so I think, over time, it will become more clear. I think as we've been talking about since we announced the acquisition, the opportunities are incredibly exciting across the portfolio of our products, whether it's Lync or Windows Live Messenger or Xbox or on the phone. And so I think not only are there great opportunities to integrate across our product portfolio but, as they were working on even before we announced the acquisition, new revenue opportunities related to advertising and premium services, so all of that's coming together as we speak. And mostly, we're incredibly excited to get to work together more fully now that the deal has closed. In terms of your question about Thailand, first thing I want to say, obviously, is our thoughts go out to all the individuals that are affected there, and we're thinking about them.

Within that, we have been managing the expenses, and so we are taking every opportunity to manage the profitability of that business, but by far, the most important thing to continue to increase the profitability is to make sure we can continue to grow the revenue, and to do that, we need to make sure we get the revenue for Search up. So that's what we're laser focused on.

There's a couple of things going on, particularly in the enterprise that really provide sustenance for the ongoing business. One is the great sort of traction we get from the integration of SharePoint and Exchange and Lync with Office 2010. So not only is there really good resonance for the Office application, but increasingly, as Bill talked about, customers are deploying communications and collaboration technology with that. And there is a lot of legs to go on the productivity server applications piece of the business. Second thing I would add is the cloud. Increasingly, every time we go in and talk to enterprises about productivity, they want to have a conversation about public cloud services, not necessarily because they want to deploy public cloud tomorrow, but they really want to understand the roadmap and understand where that's leading, and we found that creates an incredibly good conversation that then leads to a broader conversation of a long-term commitment to our platform and applications. And I think, obviously, that's a long-term phenomenon with a lot of room still to go. So the way I think about it, yes, for the Office application, particularly on the transactional side, coming off of launch here, there's some difficult comparables. But on the enterprise side, with the additional products and the cloud, that's really been the driver of our growth, and it is really a long-term catalyst."
