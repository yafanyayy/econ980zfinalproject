Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us with the PerkinElmer Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. 
We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter delivering another solid quarter of both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenue grew 9%, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 19%. 
In addition to exceeding our financial commitments we continued to make great strides on our strategic priorities. 
Touching briefly on our end markets, both the Human and Environmental businesses performed well in the quarter. In Human Health, organic revenue grew 9% with our Diagnostic business is growing mid-teens led by medical imaging and maternal and newborn health. 
In the Research market, we grew mid-single digits led by the academic market and strong growth in our cellular imaging offering. 
In Environmental Health, we experienced 10% organic growth driven by strong demand related to new and more stringent regulations for Environmental and Food Safety. 
And we will provide additional color around our end markets and our financial results in more detail later this call. I will focus my remarks on the continued progress we made this quarter on two of our strategic priorities. Increasing the growth profile of the company and expanding our operating margins. 
In the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our top line through continued expansion and emerging territories, leveraging our capabilities into adjacent markets, new product innovations and key customer wins. 
Revenues from emerging territories not exceed 25% of our total revenue and are growing overall at a mid-teens rate. Within each of the BRIC countries, we are experiencing growth greater than 20%. 
In addition, we had several important customer wins in these regions and we continue to invest in the infrastructure for future growth. 
During the quarter, we placed a number of our recently introduced newborn screening systems in emerging markets to facilitate growth there and while I put some pressure on our gross margin, it will accelerate our growth and help provide critical neonatal screening technology to those who need it. 
We also partnered with key health officials in Russia as they expand their newborn screening efforts through the countries first dried blood spot test. 
Our recent investments in Asia included a new software center of excellence in Shanghai, which will build upon our software capabilities and improve our time to market. 
We also established a center in Bangkok that will enable us to leverage our local expertise and capabilities and drive deeper penetration into the growing Southeast Asian market. 
This quarter, we continued to expand in adjacent markets. Our Medical Imaging business broadened its offerings to include new applications, including securing our first veterinary customer, as well as adding five new non-medical OEMs. 
Our market leading one source service franchise also reached new heights this quarter as it continues to experience strong geographic expansion and has doubled its revenue over the past five years. 
During the quarter, we also introduced a series of innovations targeted to advance in Human and Environmental Health, including last week's announcement of a launch of our next-generation DNA sequencing and data analysis services. 
And additionally, we increased our investments to providing epigenetic solutions with the introduction of new epigenetic space detection reagents to facilitate high torpid screening for researching diseases such as neuro degeneration and cancer. 
We also launched the first placental growth factor outside of the United States designed to help clinicians screen pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
And lastly, we expanded our digital imaging technology outside of the medical applications with the launch of two new digital x-ray flat-panel detectors for non-destructive testing. 
These are just a few examples of the great headway we are making to meet the evolving needs of our customers. 
Turning now to adjusted operating profit margins, our focus approach in increasing productivity and simplification is gaining substantial traction. Adjusted operating profit for the company grew by 60 basis points to 15.8%. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating profit increased by 100 basis points representing the top end of our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. As a result, we believe that we remain on track to achieve our goal of high teens adjusted operating profit margins by 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed the divestiture of Illumination and Detection Solutions business. Our strong balance sheet will fuel the accelerated execution against our strategic priorities. I'm pleased to note that we have a solid and expanding pipeline of potential acquisitions targets that we're actively engaged and reviewing. 
Our acquisition priorities are to build out the breath and footprint of our key end markets with particular emphasis in broadening our offerings, and services, reagents, consumables and software. 
As I look back at the past year I'm proud of the progress we made. We improved our financial strength and exceeded our financial commitments. Successfully growing organic revenue by 8%, expanding our adjusted earnings per share by 24% and generating adjusted operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year. 
We also increased the growth profile the company through a number of new markets driven innovations augmented our portfolio with several key acquisitions, expanded into adjacent markets and grew our global footprint in developing regions. 
Finally and most importantly, we believe our efforts continue to help improve the quality of life across the globe. From earlier detection of disease and combating infectious disease, to ensure cleaner drinking water and safer food. 
Moving from 2010 to 2011, our strategic priorities will remain focused on propelling our growth and employing a dedicated approach to improving our operating margins while investing in new technologies, software and services. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to walk you through our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

I'll now provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results and after my prepared remarks will open it up for questions. 
Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular manager being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As Rob mentioned previously, we had another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth over the prior year period. Reported revenue and organic revenue for the company in the fourth quarter increased 10% and 9%, respectively, as compared to the same period last year. 
By segment, organic revenue increased by 10% in Human Health and 9% in Environmental Health. By product category, our recurring revenue which includes our reagents, consumables and services represented approximately 54% of total revenue in the quarter and organic revenue grew at the high single-digit rate. 
Instruments and components represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue grew at a low double digit rate. We experienced organic revenue growth across all major geographies with particular strength in the Americas and Asia, while emerging markets remain strong in the quarter, ramping up a terrific performance for the year. 
From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represent approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve two end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 26% of total revenue; and research, which represented 20% of total revenues. 
Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew mid-teens in the fourth quarter with strong contributions from our screening and medical imaging businesses. 
In our Screening businesses, we experienced growth across all major geographies and all major product offerings. We were particularly pleased by the strong neonatal growth that we experienced in the U.S. given the backdrop of historically low birthrates experienced earlier in the year. 
We also posted broad-based growth outside of the U.S, driven in part by continued success of our efforts to expand our reach and emerging territories. 
Organic growth revenue growth at our Medical Imaging business grew over 20% in the quarter as we continue to see stronger from diagnostics, oncology and non-medical applications. 
We continue to benefit from the revamp of capital equipment investments in major hospitals and the last of our easier comparables from the prior year. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, we are continuing to expand into attractive adjacencies including non-destructive industrial testing and veterinary applications. We are pleased with a significant role in the number of new OEM customers added in 2010 in these adjacencies affording us the strong and diversified customer base for our imaging technology. 
Organic revenue in our research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by robust demand in the academic sector as a customers continue to focus in critical disease, therapeutic research and efficiencies in the lab. 
In particular, we saw strong demand for our high end opera cellular imaging systems inspire our plate readers and proprietary alpha detection reagents which are all specifically developed to address the growing need of our academic customers. 
Offsetting this growth was the continuation of soft capital spending in our large pharmaceutical accounts particularly in the area of throughput screening. 
As a result, we are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customers evolving needs. As these customers focus spending on downstream technologies and preclinical research, we are well-positioned with our In vitro imaging offering available through our Viz business. 
Additionally, it's not a tactic to accelerate cancer and neuro biological research our nearly released epigenetic base detection reagents enable high throughput screening for new drug candidates. 
The Environmental Health business represented 54% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve three end markets. Laboratory services which represented 24% of revenue; environmental and safety of which represented 21% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue in our last services business grew low double digit in the fourth quarter. Revenue from one source are unique comprehensive service offering as well as relocation and qualification services drove strong top line growth as customers continue to turn PerkinElmer for their laboratory asset management needs. 
Also in the quarter, we expanded our one source relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim as they outsource lab management, asset management for their Ontario site allowing them to better focus their resources on core pharmaceutical development competencies. 
Organic revenue in our Environmental and Safety markets grew high single digits in the fourth quarter as new and more stringent regulations for Environmental and Food Safety continue to drive the need for end lows technologies to detect contaminants, globally. 
As a result, we saw a continued strong demand for our antibiotic analysis solutions used in both the food and environmental applications for the detection of metal contaminants such as lead, arsenic and cadmium. 
We continue to see strong market penetration and adoption of our market-leading ICPMS, the next SION 200 in these markets. 
In addition, in China, as the government continues to drive tighter food safety regulations, our chromatography UV fluorescent, an inorganic solutions were chosen by key manufacturers of infant milk and dairy products for detection of heavy metals, melamine and residual pesticide ensuring compliance with these tighter requirements. 
Organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid single in the fourth quarter.  We continue to see healthy demand due impart to the six rule recovery as well as the demand for chemical and petrochemical offerings. 
Turning to our financial performance. Adjusted operating margins were up 60 basis points in the fourth quarter to 15.8%. We continue to successfully execute on our margin expansion goals across the company which afforded us the opportunity to fund additional growth investments during the quarter while absorbing the impact of new product launches and unfavorable product mix. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating margins expanded 100 basis points. In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.1% representing a decline of 10 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. 
This year, every year decline was consistent with our expectations and primary related to the start up cost on key growth initiatives and the early stage solutions from our recent acquisition, specifically Strigonomic and Bizman. We expect these acquisitions to be accretive in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health segment were 19.1%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to the full year 2009. 
The Environmental Health segment adjusted operating margins were 15.4%,  flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Within this segment, we  experienced an unfavorable product mix as well as incremental cost from the transfer of manufacturing activities related to the Sayak integration, both of which we expect to normalize in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Environmental Health segment were 12.8%, a 90 basis point improvement as compared to the full year of 2009. 
For the fourth quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 5.1%. The result of several favorable tax items realized in the period. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 27.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $0.36, compared to $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 19% from the prior year and our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 117.5 million shares. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted EPS was $1.33 representing the increase of 24.4% over the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the fourth quarter with approximately $6 million of net debt which we define as short and long-term debt minus cash. 
This reflects the decrease in net debt of approximately $413 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010, as divestiture proceeds were partially offset by open market repurchases of 3 million shares in the period. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $420 million of cash. Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $46.3million, as compared to $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
This year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of the timing of cash payment, as well as the temporary inventory build related to new products. 
On a full year basis, adjusted operating cash flow was $197 million as compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, representing the increase of 17%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the year as we continue to drive strong revenue and earnings growth. 
Now let me discuss our 2011 guidance and provide some further detail. We expect business conditions in 2011 to remain solid forecasting a continuation of the strong demand profile that we have seen environmental, food and consumer safety testing, lab services and our academic research customers. 
We expect our Screening business to return to a more normalized growth patterns as we progress through the year as birth rates begin to recover, as we penetrate diagnostic testing deeper into developing regions and expand our menu of test in the developed world. 
As for the businesses that benefited the most from the economy recovery in 2010, we're forecasting organic growth rates to moderate as we cycle up against more difficult comparisons throughout the year. 
So to reiterate what Rob shared earlier, we expect organic revenue to grow in the mid single digit range for the full year as well as the first quarter. 
Regarding adjusted operating margins, with leverage from our forecast revenue growth and continued focus on our multi-year productivity initiatives, we expect adjusted operating margins to expand 75 to 100 basis points in 2011. 
Given this adjusted operating margin expansion, we expect adjusted earnings per share from our base business to grow in a range of 12% to 15%. Additionally, we expect to redeploy the proceeds of our ideas divestiture to the combination of acquisitions and open market stock repurchases adding $0.07 to $0.11 to our adjusted EPS for the year. 
Bringing these factors together we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be in a range of $1.56 to $1.64, representing growth of 17% to 23% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31, representing growth of 16% to 24% as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dave."

With regard to the other aspect of that business, I think we continue to see good adoption of maternal testing. So I think we would sort of put that growth in the high single, low double digits from a maternal perspective.

But I think with regards to actual increase shipment products in our case it's probably a little bit delayed, but it's having an impact globally as well. You may know that China government recently issued some recent food regulations around infant milk. And that's driving growth as well. We actually won some further fairly big tender there to provide some metal around that. So I think in the short time, it's raising the visibility and I think I can say, probably in 2012 it will start to have an impact on actually people purchasing our products to do more testing."

I think when you go over in the Human Health side, we would have to diagnostic markets a little higher probably more in the high single digits. And in the Research business is probably more in the low single, probably 3% to 5%. Some of that is, they issues you've heard recently about the Pharma spending being somewhat offset by growth in academia. But I think also it speaks a little bit to where our portfolio is positioned with high throughput screening and a radio chemicals and as Andy mentioned we're were working hard to improve that portfolio in places like preclinical and the cellular imaging area. But I still think the research area for us is going to be probably in the 3% to 5% range. So at the end of the day, Human Health and Environmental Health we predict will be very similar with diagnostics sort of increasing the research growth and the applied markets in the service being in the 5% to 7% range."

But of course now you're thinking getting the instruments out there that drives a lot of our service revenue down the road. So we think that bodes well for good service growth in the future."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. 
We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, delivering another solid quarter of both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenue grew 9%, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 19%. 
In addition to exceeding our financial commitments we continued to make great strides on our strategic priorities. Touching briefly on our end markets, both the Human and Environmental businesses performed well in the quarter. In Human Health, organic revenue grew 9%, with our Diagnostic businesses growing mid-teens, led by medical imaging and maternal and newborn health. In the research market, we grew mid-single-digits, led by the academic market and strong growth in our cellular imaging offerings. In Environmental Health, we experienced 10% organic growth, driven by strong demand related to new and more stringent regulations for environmental and food safety. 
Andy will provide additional color around our end markets and our financial results in more detail later on this call. I will focus my remarks on the continued progress we made this quarter on two of our strategic priorities, increasing the growth profile of the company and expanding our operating margins. 
In the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our top line through continued expansion in emerging territories, leveraging our capabilities into adjacent markets, new product innovations and key customer wins. Revenues from emerging territories now exceed 25% of our total revenue and are growing overall at a mid-teens rate. Within each of the BRIC countries, we're experiencing growth greater than 20%. In addition, we had several important customer wins in these regions and we continue to invest in the infrastructure for future growth. 
During the quarter, we placed a number of our recently introduced newborn screening systems in emerging markets to facilitate growth there. And while it puts some pressure on our gross margins, it will accelerate our growth and help provide critical neonatal screening technology to those who need it.  We also partnered with key health officials in Russia as they expand their newborn screening efforts through the country's first dried blood spot test. 
Our recent investments in Asia included a new software center of excellence in Shanghai, which will build upon our software capabilities and improve our time-to-market. 
We also established a center in Bangkok that will enable us to leverage our local expertise and capabilities and drive deeper penetration into the growing Southeast Asian market. 
This quarter, we continued to expand in adjacent markets. Our Medical Imaging business broadened its offerings to include new applications, including securing our first veterinarian customer, as well as adding five new non-medical OEMs. 
Our market-leading OneSource service franchise also reached new heights this quarter as it continues to experience strong geographic expansion and has doubled its revenue over the past five years. 
During the quarter, we also introduced a series of innovations targeted to advancing Human and Environmental Health, including last week's announcement of the launch of our next-generation DNA sequencing and data analysis services. 
And additionally, we increased our investments in providing epigenetic solutions with the introduction of new epigenetics-based detection reagents to facilitate high-throughput screening for researching diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. 
We also launched the first placental growth factor assay kit outside of the United States, designed to help clinicians screen pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
And lastly, we expanded our digital imaging technology outside of the medical applications with the launch of two new digital x-ray flat-panel detectors for non-destructive testing. These are just a few examples of the great headway we are making to meet the evolving needs of our customers. 
Turning now to adjusted operating profit margins, our focused approach on increasing productivity and simplification is gaining substantial traction. Adjusted operating profit for the company grew by 60 basis points to 15.8%. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating profit increased by 100 basis points, representing the top end of our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. As a result, we believe that we remain on track to achieve our goal of high-teens adjusted operating profit margins by 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed the divestiture of Illumination and Detection Solutions business. Our strong balance sheet will fuel the accelerated execution against our strategic priorities. I'm pleased to note that we have a solid and expanding pipeline of potential acquisition targets that we're actively engaged in reviewing. 
Our acquisition priorities are to build out the breadth and footprint of our key end markets with particular emphasis in broadening our offerings in services, reagents, consumables and softwares. 
As I look back at the past year, I'm proud of the progress we made. We improved our financial strength and exceeded our financial commitments, successfully growing organic revenue by 8%, expanding our adjusted earnings per share by 24% and generating adjusted operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year. 
We also increased the growth profile the company through a number of new market-driven innovations augmented our portfolio with several key acquisitions, expanded into adjacent markets and grew our global footprint in developing regions. 
Finally and most importantly, we believe our efforts continue to help improve the quality of life across the globe. From earlier detection of disease and combating infectious disease, to ensuring cleaner drinking water and safer food. 
Moving from 2010 to 2011, our strategic priorities will remain focused on propelling our growth and employing a dedicated approach to improving our operating margins while investing in new technologies, software and services. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to walk you through our end-market and financial performance in greater detail."

Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As Rob mentioned previously, we had another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth over the prior year period. Reported revenue and organic revenue for the company in the fourth quarter increased 10% and 9%, respectively, as compared to the same period last year. 
By segment, organic revenue increased by 10% in Human Health and 9% in Environmental Health. By product category, our recurring revenue, which includes our reagents, consumables and services, represented approximately 54% of total revenue in the quarter and organic revenue grew at a high single-digit rate. 
Instruments and components represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue grew at a low double-digit rate. We experienced organic revenue growth across all major geographies, with particular strength in the Americas and Asia, while emerging markets remain strong in the quarter, ramping up a terrific performance for the year. 
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve two end markets: diagnostics, which represented 26% of total revenue; and research, which represented 20% of total revenues. 
Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew mid-teens in the fourth quarter, with strong contributions from our Screening and Medical Imaging businesses. In our Screening business, we experienced growth across all major geographies and all major product offerings. We were particularly pleased by the strong neonatal growth that we experienced in the U.S. given the backdrop of historically low birthrates experienced earlier in the year. We also posted broad-based growth outside of the U.S., driven in part by continued success from our efforts to expand our reach in emerging territories. 
Organic growth revenue growth at our Medical Imaging business grew over 20% in the quarter, as we continue to see strong growth from diagnostics, oncology and non-medical applications. 
We continue to benefit from the rebound of capital equipment investments in major hospitals in the last of our easier comparables from the prior year. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, we are continuing to expand into attractive adjacencies, including non-destructive industrial testing and veterinary applications. We are pleased with the significant growth in the number of new OEM customers added in 2010 in these adjacencies, affording us a strong and diversified customer base for our imaging technology. 
Organic revenue on our research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by robust demand in the academic sector, as our customers continue to focus on critical disease, therapeutic research and efficiencies in the lab. 
In particular, we saw strong demand for our high-end Opera cellular imaging systems, EnSpire Plate Readers and proprietary Alpha detection reagents, which are all specifically developed to address the growing needs of our academic customers. 
Offsetting this growth was the continuation of soft capital spending in our large pharmaceutical accounts, particularly in the area of high-throughput screening. 
As a result, we are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customers' evolving needs. As these customers focus spending on downstream technologies and pre-clinical research, we are well-positioned with our in vivo imaging offering available through our VisEn business. 
Additionally, as scientists strive to accelerate cancer and neurobiological research, our newly released epigenetic-based detection reagents enable high-throughput screening for new drug candidates. 
The Environmental Health business represented 54% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve three end markets. Laboratory services which represented 24% of revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 21% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low double-digit in the fourth quarter. Revenue from OneSource, our unique comprehensive service offering, as well as relocation and qualification services drove strong top line growth, as customers continue to turn PerkinElmer for their laboratory asset management needs. 
Also in the quarter, we expanded our one source relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim, as they outsourced lab asset management for their Ontario site, allowing them to better focus their resources on core pharmaceutical development competencies. 
Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew high single-digit in the fourth quarter, as new and more stringent regulations for environmental and food safety continue to drive the need for analytical technologies to detect contaminants globally. 
As a result, we saw a continued strong demand for our inorganic analysis solutions, used in both the food and environmental applications, for the detection of metal contaminants such as lead, arsenic and cadmium. We continue to see strong market penetration and adoption of our market-leading ICP-MS, the NexION 300, in these markets. 
In addition, in China, as the government continues to drive tighter food safety regulations, our chromatography, UV, fluorescent and inorganic solutions were chosen by key manufacturers of infant milk and dairy products for detection of heavy metals, melamine and residual pesticides, ensuring compliance with these tighter requirements. 
Organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid-single-digit in the fourth quarter. We continue to see a healthy demand, due impart to the cyclical recovery, as well as the demand for chemical and petrochemical offerings. 
Turning to our financial performance. Adjusted operating margins were up 60 basis points in the fourth quarter to 15.8%. We continue to successfully execute on our margin expansion goals across the company, which afforded us the opportunity to fund additional growth investments during the quarter while absorbing the impact of new product launches and an unfavorable product mix. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating margins expanded 100 basis points. In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.1% representing a decline of 10 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. 
This year-over-year decline was consistent with our expectations and primary related to the start up cost on key growth initiatives and the early stage solutions from our recent acquisition, specifically Signature Genomics and VisEn. We expect these acquisitions to be accretive in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health segment were 19.1%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to the full year 2009. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 15.4%, flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Within this segment, we  experienced an unfavorable product mix, as well as incremental cost from the transfer of manufacturing activities related to the SCIEX integration, both of which we expect to normalize in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Environmental Health segment were 12.8%, a 90 basis point improvement as compared to the full year 2009.  For the fourth quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 5.1%. The result of several favorable tax items realized in the period. On a non-GAAP basis, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 27.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $0.36, compared to $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted EPS was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 19% from the prior year, and our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 117.5 million shares. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted EPS was $1.33, representing an increase of 24% over the prior year.  Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $6 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. 
This reflects a decrease in net debt of approximately $413 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010, as divestiture proceeds were partially offset by open-market repurchases of 3 million shares in the period. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $420 million of cash. Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $46.3 million, as compared to $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
This year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of the timing of cash payments, as well as a temporary inventory build related to new products. 
On a full year basis, adjusted operating cash flow was $197 million, as compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 17%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the year, as we continue to drive strong revenue and earnings growth. Now let me discuss our 2011 guidance and provide some further detail. We expect business conditions in 2011 to remain solid, forecasting a continuation of the strong demand profile that we have seen in environmental, food and consumer safety testing, lab services and our academic research customers. 
We expect our Screening business to return to a more normalized growth patterns as we progress through the year, as birth rates begin to recover, as we penetrate diagnostic testing deeper into developing regions and expand our menu of test in the developed world. 
As for the businesses that benefited the most from the economy recovery in 2010, we're forecasting organic growth rates to moderate as we cycle up against more difficult comparisons throughout the year. 
So to reiterate what Rob shared earlier, we expect organic revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, as well as the first quarter. 
Regarding adjusted operating margins, with leverage from our forecasted revenue growth and continued focus on our multi-year productivity initiatives, we expect adjusted operating margins to expand 75 to 100 basis points in 2011. 
Given this adjusted operating margin expansion, we expect adjusted earnings per share from our base business to grow in a range of 12% to 15%. Additionally, we expect to redeploy the proceeds of our IDS divestiture through a combination of acquisitions and open-market stock repurchases, adding $0.07 to $0.11 to our adjusted EPS for the year. 
Bringing these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be in a range of $1.56 to $1.64, representing growth of 17% to 23% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31, representing growth of 16% to 24% as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dave."

But I think with regards to actual increased shipment products in our case, it's probably a little bit delayed. But it's having an impact globally as well. You may know that China government recently issued some recent food regulations around infant milk. And that's driving growth as well. We actually won some fairly big tender there to provide some analytical instruments around that.

But I would say, when you think about the Environmental side, both the service and applied markets are probably mid-single-digits, so probably in the 5% to 7% range. I think when you go over on the Human Health side, we would have the diagnostic markets a little higher, probably more in the high single-digits. And in the research business is probably more in the low single, probably 3% to 5%. Some of that is, the issues you've heard recently about the pharma spending being somewhat offset by growth in academia. But I think also it speaks a little bit to where our portfolio is positioned with high-throughput screening and a radiochemicals. And as Andy mentioned, we're working hard to improve that portfolio in places like pre-clinical and the cellular imaging area. But I still think the research area for us is going to be probably in the 3% to 5% range.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. 
We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, delivering another solid quarter of both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenue grew 9%, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 19%. 
In addition to exceeding our financial commitments we continued to make great strides on our strategic priorities. Touching briefly on our end markets, both the Human and Environmental businesses performed well in the quarter. In Human Health, organic revenue grew 9%, with our Diagnostic businesses growing mid-teens, led by medical imaging and maternal and newborn health. In the research market, we grew mid-single-digits, led by the academic market and strong growth in our cellular imaging offerings. In Environmental Health, we experienced 10% organic growth, driven by strong demand related to new and more stringent regulations for environmental and food safety. 
Andy will provide additional color around our end markets and our financial results in more detail later on this call. I will focus my remarks on the continued progress we made this quarter on two of our strategic priorities, increasing the growth profile of the company and expanding our operating margins. 
In the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our top line through continued expansion in emerging territories, leveraging our capabilities into adjacent markets, new product innovations and key customer wins. Revenues from emerging territories now exceed 25% of our total revenue and are growing overall at a mid-teens rate. Within each of the BRIC countries, we're experiencing growth greater than 20%. In addition, we had several important customer wins in these regions and we continue to invest in the infrastructure for future growth. 
During the quarter, we placed a number of our recently introduced newborn screening systems in emerging markets to facilitate growth there. And while it puts some pressure on our gross margins, it will accelerate our growth and help provide critical neonatal screening technology to those who need it.  We also partnered with key health officials in Russia as they expand their newborn screening efforts through the country's first dried blood spot test. 
Our recent investments in Asia included a new software center of excellence in Shanghai, which will build upon our software capabilities and improve our time-to-market. 
We also established a center in Bangkok that will enable us to leverage our local expertise and capabilities and drive deeper penetration into the growing Southeast Asian market. 
This quarter, we continued to expand in adjacent markets. Our Medical Imaging business broadened its offerings to include new applications, including securing our first veterinarian customer, as well as adding five new non-medical OEMs. 
Our market-leading OneSource service franchise also reached new heights this quarter as it continues to experience strong geographic expansion and has doubled its revenue over the past five years. 
During the quarter, we also introduced a series of innovations targeted to advancing Human and Environmental Health, including last week's announcement of the launch of our next-generation DNA sequencing and data analysis services. 
And additionally, we increased our investments in providing epigenetic solutions with the introduction of new epigenetics-based detection reagents to facilitate high-throughput screening for researching diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. 
We also launched the first placental growth factor assay kit outside of the United States, designed to help clinicians screen pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
And lastly, we expanded our digital imaging technology outside of the medical applications with the launch of two new digital x-ray flat-panel detectors for non-destructive testing. These are just a few examples of the great headway we are making to meet the evolving needs of our customers. 
Turning now to adjusted operating profit margins, our focused approach on increasing productivity and simplification is gaining substantial traction. Adjusted operating profit for the company grew by 60 basis points to 15.8%. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating profit increased by 100 basis points, representing the top end of our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. As a result, we believe that we remain on track to achieve our goal of high-teens adjusted operating profit margins by 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed the divestiture of Illumination and Detection Solutions business. Our strong balance sheet will fuel the accelerated execution against our strategic priorities. I'm pleased to note that we have a solid and expanding pipeline of potential acquisition targets that we're actively engaged in reviewing. 
Our acquisition priorities are to build out the breadth and footprint of our key end markets with particular emphasis in broadening our offerings in services, reagents, consumables and softwares. 
As I look back at the past year, I'm proud of the progress we made. We improved our financial strength and exceeded our financial commitments, successfully growing organic revenue by 8%, expanding our adjusted earnings per share by 24% and generating adjusted operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year. 
We also increased the growth profile of the company through a number of new market-driven innovations augmented our portfolio with several key acquisitions, expanded into adjacent markets and grew our global footprint in developing regions. 
Finally and most importantly, we believe our efforts continue to help improve the quality of life across the globe. From earlier detection of disease and combating infectious disease, to ensuring cleaner drinking water and safer food. 
Moving from 2010 to 2011, our strategic priorities will remain focused on propelling our growth and employing a dedicated approach to improving our operating margins while investing in new technologies, software and services. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to walk you through our end-market and financial performance in greater detail."

Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever",1766,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results. And after my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. 
Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As Rob mentioned previously, we had another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth over the prior year period. Reported revenue and organic revenue for the company in the fourth quarter increased 10% and 9%, respectively, as compared to the same period last year. 
By segment, organic revenue increased by 10% in Human Health and 9% in Environmental Health. By product category, our recurring revenue, which includes our reagents, consumables and services, represented approximately 54% of total revenue in the quarter and organic revenue grew at a high single-digit rate. 
Instruments and components represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue grew at a low double-digit rate. We experienced organic revenue growth across all major geographies, with particular strength in the Americas and Asia, while emerging markets remain strong in the quarter, ramping up a terrific performance for the year. 
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve two end markets: diagnostics, which represented 26% of total revenue; and research, which represented 20% of total revenues. 
Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew mid-teens in the fourth quarter, with strong contributions from our Screening and Medical Imaging businesses. In our Screening business, we experienced growth across all major geographies and all major product offerings. We were particularly pleased by the strong neonatal growth that we experienced in the U.S. given the backdrop of historically low birthrates experienced earlier in the year. We also posted broad-based growth outside of the U.S., driven in part by continued success from our efforts to expand our reach in emerging territories. 
Organic growth revenue growth at our Medical Imaging business grew over 20% in the quarter, as we continued to see strong growth from diagnostics, oncology and non-medical applications. 
We continued to benefit from the rebound of capital equipment investments in major hospitals in the last of our easier comparables from the prior year. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, we are continuing to expand into attractive adjacencies, including non-destructive industrial testing and veterinary applications. We are pleased with the significant growth in the number of new OEM customers added in 2010 in these adjacencies, affording us a strong and diversified customer base for our imaging technology. 
Organic revenue on our research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by robust demand in the academic sector, as our customers continue to focus on critical disease, therapeutic research and efficiencies in the lab. 
In particular, we saw strong demand for our high-end Opera cellular imaging systems, EnSpire Plate Readers and proprietary Alpha detection reagents, which are all specifically developed to address the growing needs of our academic customers. 
Offsetting this growth was the continuation of soft capital spending in our large pharmaceutical accounts, particularly in the area of high-throughput screening. 
As a result, we are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customers' evolving needs. As these customers focus their spending on downstream technologies and pre-clinical research, we are well-positioned with our in vivo imaging offering available through our VisEn business. 
Additionally, as scientists strive to accelerate cancer and neurobiological research, our newly released epigenetic-based detection reagents enable high-throughput screening for new drug candidates. 
The Environmental Health business represented 54% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve three end markets. Laboratory services which represented 24% of revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 21% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low double-digit in the fourth quarter. Revenue from OneSource, our unique comprehensive service offering, as well as relocation and qualification services drove strong top-line growth, as customers continue to turn PerkinElmer for their laboratory asset management needs. 
Also in the quarter, we expanded our OneSource relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim, as they outsourced lab asset management for their Ontario site, allowing them to better focus their resources on core pharmaceutical development competencies. 
Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew high single-digit in the fourth quarter, as new and more stringent regulations for environmental and food safety continue to drive the need for analytical technologies to detect contaminants globally. 
As a result, we saw a continued strong demand for our inorganic analysis solutions, used in both the food and environmental applications, for the detection of metal contaminants such as lead, arsenic and cadmium. We continue to see strong market penetration and adoption of our market-leading ICP-MS, the NexION 300, in these markets. 
In addition, in China, as the government continues to drive tighter food safety regulations, our chromatography, UV, fluorescent and inorganic solutions were chosen by key manufacturers of infant milk and dairy products for detection of heavy metals, melamine and residual pesticides, ensuring compliance with these tighter requirements. 
Organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid-single-digit in the fourth quarter. We continue to see a healthy demand, due in part to the cyclical recovery, as well as the demand for chemical and petrochemical offerings. 
Turning to our financial performance. Adjusted operating margins were up 60 basis points in the fourth quarter to 15.8%. We continue to successfully execute on our margin expansion goals across the company, which afforded us the opportunity to fund additional growth investments during the quarter while absorbing the impact of new product launches and an unfavorable product mix. 
For the full year, our adjusted operating margins expanded 100 basis points. In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.1% representing a decline of 10 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. 
This year-over-year decline was consistent with our expectations and primary related to the start-up cost on key growth initiatives and the early stage solutions from our recent acquisition, specifically Signature Genomics and VisEn. We expect these acquisitions to be accretive in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health segment were 19.1%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to the full year 2009. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 15.4%, flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Within this segment, we experienced an unfavorable product mix, as well as incremental cost from the transfer of manufacturing activities related to the SCIEX integration, both of which we expect to normalize in 2011. 
For the full year, adjusted operating margins in our Environmental Health segment were 12.8%, a 90 basis point improvement as compared to the full year 2009.  For the fourth quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 5.1%. The result of several favorable tax items realized in the period. On a non-GAAP basis, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 27.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $0.36, compared to $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted EPS was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 19% from the prior year, and our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 117.5 million shares. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted EPS was $1.33, representing an increase of 24% over the prior year.  Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $6 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. 
This reflects a decrease in net debt of approximately $413 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010, as divestiture proceeds were partially offset by open-market repurchases of 3 million shares in the period. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $420 million of cash. Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $46.3 million, as compared to $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
This year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of the timing of cash payments, as well as a temporary inventory build related to new products. 
On a full year basis, adjusted operating cash flow was $197 million, as compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 17%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the year, as we continue to drive strong revenue and earnings growth. Now let me discuss our 2011 guidance and provide some further detail. We expect business conditions in 2011 to remain solid, forecasting a continuation of the strong demand profile that we have seen in environmental, food and consumer safety testing, lab services and our academic research customers. 
We expect our Screening business to return to a more normalized growth patterns as we progress through the year, as birth rates begin to recover, as we penetrate diagnostic testing deeper into developing regions and expand our menu of test in the developed world. 
As for the businesses that benefited the most from the economic recovery in 2010, we're forecasting organic growth rates to moderate as we cycle up against more difficult comparisons throughout the year. 
So to reiterate what Rob shared earlier, we expect organic revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, as well as the first quarter. 
Regarding adjusted operating margins, with leverage from our forecasted revenue growth and continued focus on our multi-year productivity initiatives, we expect adjusted operating margins to expand 75 to 100 basis points in 2011. 
Given this adjusted operating margin expansion, we expect adjusted earnings per share from our base business to grow in a range of 12% to 15%. Additionally, we expect to redeploy the proceeds of our IDS divestiture through a combination of acquisitions and open-market stock repurchases, adding $0.07 to $0.11 to our adjusted EPS for the year. 
Bringing these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be in a range of $1.56 to $1.64, representing growth of 17% to 23% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31, representing growth of 16% to 24% as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dave."

But I would say, when you think about the Environmental side, both the service and applied markets are probably mid-single-digits, so probably in the 5% to 7% range. I think when you go over on the Human Health side, we would have the diagnostic markets a little higher, probably more in the high single-digits. And in the research business is probably more in the low single, probably 3% to 5%. Some of that is, the issues you've heard recently about the pharma spending being somewhat offset by growth in academia. But I think also it speaks a little bit to where our portfolio is positioned with high-throughput screening and a radiochemicals. And as Andy mentioned, we're working hard to improve that portfolio in places like pre-clinical and the cellular imaging area. But I still think the research area for us is going to be probably in the 3% to 5% range.

So whether it's service, reagents, consumables, software from that perspective. Financially, I don't think you should expect where we do something significantly dilutive. I think if you look at historically, we've done some minor dilutions in a short period of time. But generally, beyond 12 months, it becomes accretive. So we're not looking to do something that would be significantly dilutive. I think the financial metrics we're looking at is obviously return on cash and return on invested capital. So we're looking at sort of IRI or return on invested capital, and trying to obviously be smart with the capital deployment."

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a very successful start of the year as we delivered excellent financial results while continuing to fund strategic investments, supporting our longer term growth initiatives. 
Looking at the first quarter, we generated very strong growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share, exceeding both our top and bottom line guidance that we shared with you in February. Reported revenue was up 14%, organic revenue grew 10%, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 160 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 36%. Andy will provide the specific details on our financial performance however, in summary, the growth we experienced in the first quarter, was attributable to improving end markets, growth from new products, continued strength in emerging territories and our efforts to focus the company on fewer more attractive market segments and applications. Furthermore, the emphasis we are placing on expanding our operating margins was apparent in the quarter as we experienced very good flow through from the incremental revenue, despite headwinds from an unfavorable mix. The 160 basis points increase over first quarter of last year reinforces our belief that we can achieve adjusted operating profit margins in the high teens by 2014. Just as important as a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made very good progress on increasing the growth profile of the company, the return on investments as well as external collaborations and acquisitions. 
In the first quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities within selected geographies and applications. This is allowing us to capitalize on increasingly stringent environmental regulations and the growing demand for greater access to health care and emerging territories, particularly related to newborn maternal health and infectious disease. 
During the quarter, we funded a series of investments targeted at providing our customers with better tools to advance Human and Environmental Health. In particular, several of our new product innovations provide customers with multiple modes of operation within 1 instrument creating a more efficient lab environment. 3 of these MultiMode innovations are the label free inspired plate reader, which help scientist to enable discovery of potential therapeutic targets. The spectrum to infrared analyzer which provides better near and midrange infrared capabilities for characterizing chemical and biological materials. 
In the next ICP-MS system, which advances trace element analysis through 3 modes of operation for better food and order analysis. I'm also pleased with our ability to leverage adjacencies in the diagnostics and therapeutic markets with new applications such as Onco chips a new microtechnology to aid in faster, earlier and more accurate diagnoses of hemacological malignancies. Additionally, we expanded our core blood banking business to include umbilical cord tissue banking services, which will help to provide patients more options in new cell therapies. 
And finally, we introduced our new epigenetics-based detection reagents, which help to accelerate drug discovery research from now on therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. In the first quarter, we also made a number of strategic acquisitions that increase our ability to address our customers growing needs. While each of the acquired businesses brings us unique capabilities, the acquisitions are targeted on 2 critical areas. The first area is the need for better tools to interpret and manage the vast amounts of data that laboratories generate every day. Through the cambridge soft and artists lab acquisitions, we'll have the capability of providing a robust informatics platform that will enable customers to maximize the laboratory efficiency and harness critical information and insights. 
In addition, we can provide our customers with the ability to rapidly access and share enterprise wide data for faster, more informed scientific decisions. The secondary of increased investment was in the area of DNA analysis with the intention of complementing our current capabilities in protein based analysis. Increasingly, customers want to perform experiments that look at both proteins and genes. Therefore, we are selectively adding to our existing competencies as we did with our purchase of signature Genomics in 2010. This year, we have broaden our DNA analysis for print and in sample prep, and DNA sequencing. We accomplished this through the purchase of comegen, which provides a complete solution, to acids our sample preparation. 
The acquisition of Geospiza announced earlier today which is a bio informatics software company focused on sequencing and the launch of our next generation sequencing service. As a result of these acquisitions, and repurchasing 7 million shares in the open market over last 2 quarters, we have reinvested approximately 90% of the divestiture proceeds from the sale of the Illumination and Detection solutions business. 
I am pleased that we redeployed the capital in a way that should allow us to achieve the high-end of our regional guidance of $0.07 to $0.11 accretion while increasing our recurring revenues and significantly expanding our scale and critical growth drivers for the company. 
In closing, I believe that were off to a strong start as the organization is executing well against our operating priorities as well as continuing to invest for long term profitable growth. As a result, we've decided to raise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year to $1.62 through a $1.67 with the midpoint representing a 24% increase over 2010. I will now hand the call over to Andy who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

I will now provide some financial details on our first quarter results and following my prepared remarks, will open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever",1655,"Thanks, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. I will now provide some financial details on our first quarter results and following my prepared remarks, will open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down referring to an increase or decrease in net measure during the first quarter of 2011, compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we had another strong quarter of revenue adjusted earnings growth. Revenue for the first quarter increased by 14% and organic revenue increased by 10% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% in Human Health and 17% in Environmental Health. Recurring revenue which includes reagents, consumables and services represented approximately 56% of total revenue in the quarter with organic revenue growing at a mid-single-digit rate. 
Estimates and components represent approximately 44% of total revenue in the first quarter with organic revenue growing at a high teens. We've experienced strong organic revenue growth across all major geographies with the Americas and Europe growing at high single digit rates and Asia growing high teens. Additionally, as Rob mentioned, our focus on emerging markets continues to gain traction with almost a quarter of our total revenue now coming from these key regions and growing at a double digit rate at the quarter. 
From an end market perspective, Perkin numbers, Human Health segment represented approximately 45% of total revenue in the quarter. Within this segment, we serve 2 end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 27% of total revenue; and research, which represented 18% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue from our diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the first quarter with contributions from our streaming business more than offsetting a modest decline of our Medical Imaging business as it cycled up against very difficult prior year comparisons. 
In our Screening business we experienced growth across all major geographies. Within the U.S., growth was primarily due to the timing of certain shipments in the quarter as birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline at a low single digit rate. Outside of the U.S. will continue to benefit increasing adoption rate for neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings, particularly in emerging markets. Organic revenue and our Medical Imaging business declined a little single-digit rate in the quarter. Robust demand and adjacent markets including industrial and that's in our were offset by declines in the base business result very difficult comparables in the prior year. The success we achieved and adding new OEM customers at adjacent markets has helped reduced the cyclicality of the business to the diversification of our customer base for the skate imaging technology. Organic revenue in our research business declined out of low single-digit rate in the first quarter as we express considered healthy demand and academic sector as early stage therapeutic researchers continue their efforts to optimize screening efficiencies in the lab. In particular, we saw strong demand for operators center imaging systems and aspire multi-papers about the which of target features and price points aligned with the needs of our academic customers. These technologies coupled with our automated sample preparation systems provide a compelling, high throughput solution for these key customer segment. Also in both academic sector was a decline in organic revenue with a large-pharma. This decline was primarily related to a larger than to separate a contraction in our legacy, radio, isotope portfolio however, we were encouraged by growth in both not an estimates supporting our high throughput screening offering. We expect positive growth in the region segment for the full year and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the geographic shift to reserves Asia global investments targeting preclinical research as well as what we believe are improving trends in the pharmaceutical segment. 
Now let's turn to Environmental Health which represented 55% of our total revenues in the first quarter. Within Environmental Health we serve pre-markets laboratory services which represented 24% of total revenue, environmental and safety which represented 21% and industrial which represented 10% of total revenue. Organic revenue and our lab services business grew low double digits in the first quarter as the ones as business once again poses strong top line growth as this unique comprehensive service offerings continues to expand globally. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew over 20% in the first quarter as increased environmental and food safety regulations continued to drive strong demand for our ethical technologies. During the quarter, we saw strength in our organic analysis solutions used with a deck medical examiners include and environmental applications. Revenues from our Axion 300 ICP mass more than doubled versus the first quarter 2010 as this highly efficient multi-mode instrument continues to gain share in these markets. Additionally, our guests offering grew low double-digit in the period due to ongoing concerns around food additives as well as pesticide contaminants in both food and water. 
Finally, organic revenue and our industrial market grew over 20% in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand in industrial applications due in part to the cyclical recovery and the timing of demand fulfillment. We also experienced significant growth in our GC solutions and our new spectrum to infrared instrument used in chemical and petrochemical applications. 
Looking over at our financial performance adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points in the first quarter to 13.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from healthy incremental flow through on strong sales the result of productivity improvement and the benefit of prior restructuring actions partially offset by unfavorable product mix and growth investments executed in the period. 
In our Human Health segment adjusted over the margins were 17.9% representing an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were partially offset by acquisition integration related costs and growth investments. And in our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.6% representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
Within this segment we experienced healthy volume leverage, a favorable product mix as well as solid productivity gains including the realization of expected benefits related to the science integration. GAAP operating profits was $39.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
For the first quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 22.9% and a non-GAAP basis our adjusted tax rate was 26.9%, which is consistent with our guidance communicated in February. GAAP EPS we continue operations in the first quarter of 2011 was $0.22, compared to $0.17 in the first quarter of 2010 while our adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the first quarter of 2011  up 36% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately 115.1 million shares. 
Turning to balance sheet we finished the first quarter with approximately $100 million of net debt which we defined as short and long term debt minus cash. This reflect a decrease in net that approximately $94 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due primarily to open market repurchases of 4 million shares and payment for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $460 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $47.3 million as compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. This modest year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of an approval tax impact associated with the sale of IDS. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating cash flow increased 7% in the period.  In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong revenue and adjusted earnings growth. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter and full year 2011 guidance. Consistent with our view as expressed early in the year, we expect business conditions for the remainder of 2011 to remain solid. We're forecasting a similar demand profile and environmental food safety testing, lab services and academic research but we expect others to moderate to do more challenging comparables for the balance of the year. Additionally, we expect our screening business to generate more normalized growth rates is in the back half of the year as birthrates in the U.S. begin to recover. Accordingly we are forecasting organic revenue to by the mid-single-digit range for the full year as well as for the second quarter. Regarding adjusted operating margins, we do expect expansion to be at the high-end of our range of our stated objectives of 75 to 100 basis points for all of 2011. This expansion will be driven primarily by volume leverage and continued traction on a multi-year productivity initiatives offset by growth investments to ensure the sustainability of our long-term financial performance. Addition a due to the timing of revenue recognition existing cambric contract expect the majority of full year profits to be realized in the fourth quarter. As Rob mentioned we have redeployed approximately 90% of the proceeds to the divestiture of elimination detection solutions business to highly productive assets. We continued to look for opportunities to deploy capital in accordance with our strategy but not required to do so to achieve our full year guidance. Bringing this factors together, we estimate our fully adjusted earnings per share of 2011 to increase from previously communicated range of $1.56 to $1.64 to a new range of $1.62 to $1.67 representing growth of 22% to 26% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expected adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.48 representing growth of 15% to 21`% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a very successful start to the year as we delivered excellent financial results while continuing to fund strategic investments, supporting our longer term growth initiatives. 
Looking at the first quarter, we generated very strong growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share, exceeding both our top and bottom line guidance that we shared with you in February. 
Reported revenue, it was up 14%. Organic revenue grew 10%. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 160 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 36%. Andy will provide the specific details on our financial performance. However, in summary, the growth we experienced in the first quarter was attributable to: improving end markets; growth from new products; continued strength in emerging territories; and our efforts to focus the company on fewer, more attractive market segments and applications. 
Furthermore, the emphasis we are placing on expanding our operating margins was apparent in the quarter as we experienced very good flow-through from the incremental revenue despite headwinds from an unfavorable mix. The 160 basis points increase over first quarter of last year reinforces our belief that we can achieve adjusted operating profit margins in the high teens by 2014. 
Just as important as a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made very good progress on increasing the growth profile of the company through internal investments as well as external collaborations and acquisitions. 
In the first quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities within selected geographies and applications. This is allowing us to capitalize on increasingly stringent environmental regulations and the growing demand for greater access to health care and emerging territories, particularly related to newborn, maternal health and infectious disease. 
During the quarter, we funded a series of investments targeted at providing our customers with better tools to advance human and environmental health. In particular, several of our new product innovations provide customers with multiple modes of operation within one instrument, creating a more efficient lab environment. Three of these multimode innovations are: the label-free EnSpire Plate Reader, which helps scientists to enable discovery of potential new therapeutic targets; the Spectrum Two infrared analyzer, which provides better near and midrange infrared capabilities for characterizing chemical and biological materials;
and the NexION ICP-MS system, which advances trace element analysis through 3 modes of operation for better food and water analysis. 
I'm also pleased with our ability to leverage adjacencies in the diagnostics and therapeutic markets with new applications such as OncoChip, a new microarray technology to aid in faster, earlier and more accurate diagnosis of hematological malignancies. Additionally, we expanded our Cord Blood Banking business to include umbilical cord tissue banking services, which will help to provide patients more options in new cell therapies. 
And finally, we introduced our new epigenetics-based detection reagents, which help to accelerate drug discovery research for novel therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. In the first quarter, we also made a number of strategic acquisitions that increase our ability to address our customer's growing needs. While each of the acquired businesses brings us unique capabilities, the acquisitions are targeted on 2 critical areas. The first area is the need for better tools to interpret and manage the vast amounts of data that laboratories generate every day. Through the CambridgeSoft and ArtusLabs acquisitions, we will have the capability of providing a robust informatics platform that will enable customers to maximize their laboratory efficiency and harness critical information and insights. 
In addition, we can provide our customers with the ability to rapidly access and share enterprise-wide data for faster, more informed scientific decisions. The second area of increased investment was in the area of DNA analysis with the intention of complementing our current capabilities in protein-based analysis. 
Increasingly, our customers want to perform experiments that look at both proteins and genes. Therefore, we are selectively adding to our existing competencies, as we did with our purchase of Signature Genomics in 2010. This year, we have broadened our DNA analysis footprint in sample prep, bioinformatics and DNA sequencing. 
We accomplished this through the purchase of chemagen, which provides a complete solution to nucleic acids sample preparation; the acquisition of Geospiza, announced earlier today, which is a bioinformatics software company focused on sequencing; and the launch of our Next Generation Sequencing Service. As a result of these acquisitions, and repurchasing 7 million shares in the open market over the last 2 quarters, we have reinvested approximately 90% of the divestiture proceeds from the sale of the Illumination and Detection Solutions business. 
I am pleased that we have redeployed the capital in a way that should allow us to achieve the high end of our regional guidance of $0.07 to $0.11 accretion while increasing our recurring revenues and significantly expanding our scale in critical growth drivers for the company. 
In closing, I believe that we're off to a strong start as the organization is executing well against our operating priorities, as well as continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. As a result, we have decided to raise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year to $1.62 through $1.67, with the midpoint representing a 24% increase over 2010. 
I will now hand the call over to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

I'll now provide some additional details on our first quarter results. And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that wheneve",1675,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now provide some additional details on our first quarter results. And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we had another strong quarter of revenue and adjusted earnings growth. Revenue for the first quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 10% as compared to the same period last year. 
By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% in Human Health and 17% in Environmental Health. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and services, represented approximately 56% of total revenue in the quarter, with organic revenue growing at a mid-single digit rate. 
Instruments and components represented approximately 44% of total revenue in the first quarter, with organic revenue growing in the high teens. We experienced strong organic revenue growth across all major geographies with the Americas and Europe growing at high single digit rates and Asia growing high teens. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, our focus on emerging markets continues to gain traction with almost a quarter of our total revenue now coming from these key regions and growing at a double digit rate at the quarter. From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 45% of total revenue in the quarter. Within this segment, we serve 2 end markets: diagnostics, which represented 27% of total revenue; and research, which represented 18% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the first quarter, with contributions from our Screening business more than offsetting a modest decline in our Medical Imaging business as it cycled up against very difficult prior year comparisons. 
In our Screening business, we experienced growth across all major geographies. Within the U.S., growth was primarily due to the timing of certain shipments in the quarter as birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline at a low single digit rate. Outside of the U.S., we continued to benefit from an increasing adoption rate for our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings, particularly in emerging markets. Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business declined to the low single-digit rate in the quarter. Robust demand in adjacent markets, including industrial and veterinary, were offset by declines in the base business, a result of very difficult comparables in the prior year. 
The success we achieved in adding new OEM customers and adjacent markets has helped reduced the cyclicality of the business due to diversification of our customer base for this key imaging technology. Organic revenue in our Research business declined to the low single digit rate in the first quarter as we experienced continued healthy demand in the academic sector as early stage therapeutic researchers continue their efforts to optimize screening efficiencies in the lab. 
In particular, we saw strong demand for our Operetta cellular imaging systems and EnSpire Multimode Plate Readers, both of which have target features and price points aligned with the needs of our academic customers. These technologies, coupled with our automated sample preparation systems, provide a compelling, high throughput solution for this key customer segment. Offsetting growth in the academic sector was a decline in organic revenue within large pharma. This decline was primarily related to a larger-than-anticipated contraction in our legacy radioisotope portfolio. However, we were encouraged by growth in both non-rad reagents and instruments supporting our high-throughput screening offering. 
We expect positive growth in the reagent segment for the full year and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the geographic shift of research to Asia, global investments targeting preclinical research, as well as what we believe are improving trends in the pharmaceutical segment. 
Now let's turn to Environmental Health, which represented 55% of our total revenues in the first quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve 3 markets: laboratory services, which represented 24% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 21%; and industrial, which represented 10% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low double digits in the first quarter as our OneSource business once again posted strong topline growth as this unique comprehensive service offering continues to expand globally. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew over 20% in the first quarter as increased environmental and food safety regulations continued to drive strong demand for our analytical technologies. 
During the quarter, we saw strength in our inorganic analysis solutions, used for detecting trace metal contaminants in food and environmental applications. Revenues from our NexION 300 ICP-MS more than doubled versus the first quarter of 2010 as this highly efficient multimode instrument continues to gain share in these markets. 
Additionally, our gas chromatography offering grew low double digit in the period, driven by ongoing concerns around food additives and adulterants as well as pesticide contaminants in both food and water. 
Finally, organic revenue in our industrial market grew over 20% in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand in industrial applications due in part to the cyclical recovery and the timing of demand fulfillment. We also experienced significant growth in our GC Engineered Solutions and our new Spectrum Two infrared instrument used in chemical and petrochemical applications. 
Looking at our overall financial performance, adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points in the first quarter to 13.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from healthy incremental flow-through on strong sales, a result of productivity improvement and the benefit of prior year restructuring actions, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and growth investments executed in the period. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 17.9%, representing an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were partially offset by acquisition integration-related costs and growth investments. 
In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.6%, representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
Within this segment, we experienced healthy volume leverage, a favorable product mix as well as solid productivity gains, including the realization of expected benefits related to the SCIEX integration. 
GAAP operating profits was $39.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. For the first quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 22.9%. And on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 26.9%, which is consistent with our guidance communicated in February. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011 was $0.22 compared to $0.17 in the first quarter of 2010 while our adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the first quarter of 2011, up 36% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately 115.1 million shares. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with approximately $100 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $94 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to open market repurchases of 4 million shares and payment for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $416 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $47.3 million as compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. This modest year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of an unfavorable tax impact associated with the sale of IDS. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating cash flow increased 7% in the period.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong revenue and adjusted earnings growth. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter and full year 2011 guidance. Consistent with our view as expressed early in the year, we expect business conditions for the remainder of 2011 to remain solid. We're forecasting a similar demand profile in environmental food safety testing, lab services and academic research, but we expect growth rates to moderate due to more challenging comparables for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we expect our Screening business to generate more normalized growth rates in the back half of the year as birthrates in the U.S. begin to recover. Accordingly, we're forecasting organic revenue to grow in the mid single digit range for the full year as well as for the second quarter. 
Regarding adjusted operating margins, we now expect expansion to be at the high-end of our range of our stated objectives of 75 to 100 basis points for all of 2011. This expansion will be driven primarily by volume leverage and continued traction on our multiyear productivity initiatives, offset by growth investments to ensure the sustainability of our long-term financial performance. 
Additionally, due to the timing of revenue recognition of existing CambridgeSoft contracts, we expect the majority of its full year profits to be realized in the fourth quarter. As Rob mentioned, we have redeployed approximately 90% of the proceeds from the divestiture of the Illumination and Detection Solutions business to highly productive assets. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in accordance with our strategy, but are no longer required to do so to achieve our full year guidance. 
Bringing this factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to increase from the previously communicated range of $1.56 to $1.64 to a new range of $1.62 to $1.67, representing growth of 22% to 26% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40, representing growth of 15% to 21% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So it was nice to see. We saw strength both on the plate readers as well as on the reagent side. Andy mentioned the fact that however offsetting that was the fact that our rad business contracted a little bit more than what we've seen historically. And we think that somewhat timing-related, but we'll just have to wait and see how that pans out for the rest of the year. So I would say, when I think about the research market, we're starting to see some recovery on the screening side in pharma and both academics. So that's the good news. The offset to that is we are seeing pressure on the radioactive side of our business. But as Andy said, we are expecting the research business to be positive for the year, probably low to mid single digits."

We'd sort of increased over the last couple of year's from 50% to 60%. Now we'll be pushing through to 65%. But we see informatics as a real opportunity. And I would say, there's a couple of drivers to that. First of all, clearly, the consolidation that's going on is requiring our customers to have better connection between the scientific efforts, whether its the outsourcing of R&D, the CROs that are requiring the ability to share information seamlessly, whether it's a focus on productivity or whether it's just a fact that the instrumentations are continuing to generate a more and more information. And there's a real need to be able to search, analyze, store and share that information. So we think, consistent with what we've done with our service offering, there's a huge opportunity to help our customers sort through this need to have a much better informatics platform. And so we did CambridgeSoft. Let's think about it sort of a backbone brings in a very strong electronic notebook. ArtusLabs brings us some fairly good capability around imaging. They've got some -- particularly technology around optical structure recognition. And then, of course, Geospiza brings us cloud computing and some real good capabilities around sequencing, which is complementary to our Sequencing Service."

I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a very successful start to the year as we delivered excellent financial results while continuing to fund strategic investments, supporting our",896,"Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a very successful start to the year as we delivered excellent financial results while continuing to fund strategic investments, supporting our longer term growth initiatives. 
Looking at the first quarter, we generated very strong growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share, exceeding both our top and bottom line guidance that we shared with you in February. 
Reported revenue, it was up 14%. Organic revenue grew 10%. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 160 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 36%. Andy will provide the specific details on our financial performance. However, in summary, the growth we experienced in the first quarter was attributable to improving end markets; growth from new products; continued strength in emerging territories; and our efforts to focus the company on fewer, more attractive market segments and applications. 
Furthermore, the emphasis we are placing on expanding our operating margins was apparent in the quarter as we experienced very good flow-through from the incremental revenue despite headwinds from an unfavorable mix. The 160 basis points increase over first quarter of last year reinforces our belief that we can achieve adjusted operating profit margins in the high teens by 2014. 
Just as important as a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made very good progress on increasing the growth profile of the company through internal investments as well as external collaborations and acquisitions. 
In the first quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities within selected geographies and applications. This is allowing us to capitalize on increasingly stringent environmental regulations and the growing demand for greater access to health care in emerging territories, particularly related to newborn, maternal health and infectious disease. 
During the quarter, we funded a series of investments targeted at providing our customers with better tools to advance human and environmental health. In particular, several of our new product innovations provide customers with multiple modes of operation within one instrument, creating a more efficient lab environment. Three of these multimode innovations are the label-free EnSpire Plate Reader, which helps scientists to enable discovery of potential new therapeutic targets; the Spectrum Two infrared analyzer, which provides better near and midrange infrared capabilities for characterizing chemical and biological materials;
and the NexION ICP-MS system, which advances trace element analysis through 3 modes of operation for better food and water analysis. 
I'm also pleased with our ability to leverage adjacencies in the diagnostics and therapeutic markets with new applications such as OncoChip, a new microarray technology to aid in faster, earlier and more accurate diagnosis of hematological malignancies. Additionally, we expanded our Cord Blood Banking business to include umbilical cord tissue banking services, which will help to provide patients more options in new cell therapies. 
And finally, we introduced our new epigenetics-based detection reagents, which help to accelerate drug discovery research for novel therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. In the first quarter, we also made a number of strategic acquisitions that increase our ability to address our customers' growing needs. While each of the acquired businesses brings us unique capabilities, the acquisitions are targeted on 2 critical areas. The first area is the need for better tools to interpret and manage the vast amounts of data that laboratories generate every day. Through the CambridgeSoft and ArtusLabs acquisitions, we will have the capability of providing a robust informatics platform that will enable customers to maximize their laboratory efficiency and harness critical information and insights. 
In addition, we can provide our customers with the ability to rapidly access and share enterprise-wide data for faster, more informed scientific decisions. The second area of increased investment was in the area of DNA analysis with the intention of complementing our current capabilities in protein-based analysis. 
Increasingly, our customers want to perform experiments that look at both proteins and genes. Therefore, we are selectively adding to our existing competencies, as we did with our purchase of Signature Genomics in 2010. This year, we have broadened our DNA analysis footprint in sample prep, bioinformatics and DNA sequencing. 
We accomplished this through the purchase of chemagen, which provides a complete solution to nucleic acids sample preparation; the acquisition of Geospiza, announced earlier today, which is a bioinformatics software company focused on sequencing; and the launch of our Next Generation Sequencing Service. As a result of these acquisitions, and repurchasing 7 million shares in the open market over the last 2 quarters, we have reinvested approximately 90% of the divestiture proceeds from the sale of the Illumination and Detection Solutions business. 
I am pleased that we have redeployed the capital in a way that should allow us to achieve the high end of our original guidance of $0.07 to $0.11 accretion while increasing our recurring revenues and significantly expanding our scale and critical growth drivers for the company. 
In closing, I believe that we're off to a strong start as the organization is executing well against our operating priorities, as well as continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. As a result, we have decided to raise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year to $1.62 through $1.67, with the midpoint representing a 24% increase over 2010. 
I will now hand the call over to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

I'll now provide some additional details on our first quarter results. And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions.

And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we had another strong quarter of revenue and adjusted earnings growth. Revenue for the first quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 10% as compared to the same period last year. 
By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% in Human Health and 17% in Environmental Health. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and services, represented approximately 56% of total revenue in the quarter, with organic revenue growing at a mid-single digit rate. 
Instruments and components represented approximately 44% of total revenue in the first quarter, with organic revenue growing in the high teens. We experienced strong organic revenue growth across all major geographies with the Americas and Europe growing at high-single digit rates and Asia growing high teens. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, our focus on emerging markets continues to gain traction with almost a quarter of our total revenue now coming from these key regions and growing at a double digit rate in the quarter. From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 45% of total revenue in the quarter. Within this segment, we serve 2 end markets: diagnostics, which represented 27% of total revenue; and research, which represented 18% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the first quarter, with contributions from our Screening business more than offsetting a modest decline in our Medical Imaging business as it cycled up against very difficult prior year comparisons. 
In our Screening business, we experienced growth across all major geographies. Within the U.S., growth was primarily due to the timing of certain shipments in the quarter as birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline at a low-single digit rate. Outside of the U.S., we continued to benefit from an increasing adoption rate for our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings, particularly in emerging markets. Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business declined at a low-single digit rate in the quarter. Robust demand in adjacent markets, including industrial and veterinary, were offset by declines in the base business, a result of very difficult comparables in the prior year. 
The success we achieved in adding new OEM customers in adjacent markets has helped reduce the cyclicality of the business due to diversification of our customer base for this key imaging technology. Organic revenue in our Research business declined at a low-single digit rate in the first quarter as we experienced continued healthy demand in the academic sector as early stage therapeutic researchers continue their efforts to optimize screening efficiencies in the lab. 
In particular, we saw strong demand for our Operetta cellular imaging systems and EnSpire Multimode Plate Readers, both of which have targeted features and price points aligned with the needs of our academic customers. These technologies, coupled with our automated sample preparation systems, provide a compelling, high throughput solution for this key customer segment. Offsetting growth in the academic sector was a decline in organic revenue within large pharma. This decline was primarily related to a larger-than-anticipated contraction in our legacy radioisotope portfolio. However, we were encouraged by growth in both non-rad reagents and instruments supporting our high-throughput screening offering. 
We expect positive growth in the reagent segment for the full year and believe we are well positioned to benefit from the geographic shift of research to Asia, global investments targeting preclinical research, as well as what we believe are improving trends in the pharmaceutical segment. 
Now let's turn to Environmental Health, which represented 55% of our total revenues in the first quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve 3 markets: laboratory services, which represented 24% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 21%; and industrial, which represented 10% of total revenue. 
Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low-double digits in the first quarter as our OneSource business once again posted strong top line growth as this unique comprehensive service offering continues to expand globally. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew over 20% in the first quarter as increased environmental and food safety regulations continued to drive strong demand for our analytical technologies. 
During the quarter, we saw strength in our inorganic analysis solutions, used for detecting trace metal contaminants in food and environmental applications. Revenues from our NexION 300 ICP-MS more than doubled versus the first quarter of 2010 as this highly efficient multimode instrument continues to gain share in these markets. 
Additionally, our gas chromatography offering grew low-double digit in the period, driven by ongoing concerns around food additives and adulterants as well as pesticide contaminants in both food and water. 
Finally, organic revenue in our industrial market grew over 20% in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand in industrial applications due in part to the cyclical recovery and the timing of demand fulfillment. We also experienced significant growth in our GC Engineered Solutions and our new Spectrum Two infrared instrument used in chemical and petrochemical applications. 
Looking at our overall financial performance, adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points in the first quarter to 13.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from healthy incremental flow-through on strong sales, a result of productivity improvement and the benefit of prior year restructuring actions, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and growth investments executed in the period. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 17.9%, representing an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were partially offset by acquisition integration-related costs and growth investments. 
In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.6%, representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
Within the segment, we experienced healthy volume leverage, a favorable product mix as well as solid productivity gains, including the realization of the expected benefits related to the SCIEX integration. 
GAAP operating profit was $39.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. For the first quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 22.9%. And on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 26.9%, which is consistent with our guidance communicated in February. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011 was $0.22 compared to $0.17 in the first quarter of 2010 while our adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the first quarter of 2011, up 36% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately 115.1 million shares. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with approximately $100 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $94 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to open market repurchases of 4 million shares and payment for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $416 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $47.3 million as compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. This modest year-over-year decline in the quarter was primarily the result of an unfavorable tax impact associated with the sale of IDS. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating cash flow increased 7% in the period.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong revenue and adjusted earnings growth. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter and full year 2011 guidance. Consistent with our views expressed earlier in the year, we expect business conditions for the remainder of 2011 to remain solid. We're forecasting a similar demand profile in environmental food safety testing, lab services and academic research, but we expect growth rates to moderate due to more challenging comparables for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we expect our Screening business to generate more normalized growth rates in the back half of the year as birthrates in the U.S. begin to recover. Accordingly, we're forecasting organic revenue to grow in the mid-single digit range for the full year as well as for the second quarter. 
Regarding adjusted operating margins, we now expect expansion to be at the high end of our range of our stated objectives of 75 to 100 basis points for all of 2011. This expansion will be driven primarily by volume leverage and continued traction on our multiyear productivity initiatives, offset by growth investments to ensure the sustainability of our long-term financial performance. 
Additionally, due to the timing of revenue recognition of existing CambridgeSoft contracts, we expect the majority of its full year profits to be realized in the fourth quarter. As Rob mentioned, we have redeployed approximately 90% of the proceeds from the divestiture of the Illumination and Detection Solutions business to highly productive assets. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in accordance with our strategy, but are no longer required to do so to achieve our full year guidance. 
Bringing these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to increase from the previously communicated range of $1.56 to $1.64 to a new range of $1.62 to $1.67, representing growth of 22% to 26% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40, representing growth of 15% to 21% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

We saw strength both on the plate readers as well as on the reagent side. Andy mentioned the fact that, however, offsetting that was the fact that our rad business contracted a little bit more than what we've seen historically. And we think that’s somewhat timing-related, but we'll just have to wait and see how that pans out for the rest of the year. So I would say, when I think about the research market, we're starting to see some recovery on the screening side in pharma and both academics. So that's the good news. The offset to that is we are seeing pressure on the radioactive side of our business. But as Andy said, we are expecting the research business to be positive for the year, probably low- to mid-single digits."

We've sort of increased over the last couple of years from 50% to 60%. Now we'll be pushing through to 65%. But we see informatics as a real opportunity. And I would say, there's a couple of drivers to that. First of all, clearly, the consolidation that's going on is requiring our customers to have better connection between the scientific efforts, whether it’s the outsourcing of R&D, the CROs that are requiring the ability to share information seamlessly, whether it's a focus on productivity or whether it's just a fact that the instrumentations are continuing to generate more and more information. And there's a real need to be able to search, analyze, store and share that information. So we think, consistent with what we've done with our service offering, there's a huge opportunity to help our customers sort through this need to have a much better informatics platform. And so we did CambridgeSoft. Let's think about it sort of a backbone, brings in a very strong electronic notebook. ArtusLabs brings us some fairly good capability around imaging. They've got some -- particularly technology around optical structure recognition. And then, of course, Geospiza brings us cloud computing and some real good capabilities around sequencing, which is complementary to our Sequencing Service."

I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continue to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance in both the top and bottom line. Reven",1034,"Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continue to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance in both the top and bottom line. Revenue grew 14%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And adjusted EPS grew 27%. We're particularly pleased with the growth year-over-year as we had some difficult comparisons given the very strong quarter we had in Q2 last year. 
In addition to the strong financial results, in the second quarter, we continued to expand the capabilities of the company and invest to improve our growth profile through acquisitions, as well as internal investments in R&D. In the second quarter, we further expanded our presence in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East and Africa with targeted applications. In particular, we made good progress with the launch of our new high sensitivity kits for hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases in China and experienced strong demand in the Middle East to meet the rising need for better newborn screening capabilities, including a large installation in Saudi Arabia, which follows our major installation in Cairo earlier this year. 
In addition, we obtained our first cell screening orders in Africa, a region with high incidence levels, to provide earlier diagnosis for management of this disease. We also launched the series of innovations within our market-leading inorganic analysis portfolio, targeted at helping customers ensures safer order, food and pharmaceuticals. The label free EnSpire plate reader, which we introduced last quarter, continues to experience strong receptivity as scientists look to improve the discovery of potential new therapeutic targets. Our OneSource Laboratory Service business continues to express good growth and is gaining traction expanding outside of its traditional pharmaceutical based evidenced by the recent addition of the significant new account in environmental testing. During the quarter, we were able to further expand PerkinElmer's current Medical Imaging portfolio with the acquisition of Excella, providing customers with high speed, high resolution CMOS technology. This technology is complementary to our amorphous silicon-based technology in key areas such as surgery, cardiology and mammography. And is the only provider of both amorphous silicon and CMOS capabilities, we can now provide the technology that best fits our customers' specific applications. 
As I mentioned last quarter, the growing challenge for customers is managing and interpreting large amounts of data. A key area of focus for us is helping customers overcome these data challenges by providing enterprisewide knowledge solutions. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities in area of informatics with the addition of electronics, which uniquely positions us to deploying electronic laboratory solution across a global customer's entire value chain from research to manufacturing. Combined with our service and instrument capabilities, we are increasing our ability to closely collaborate and partner with our customers across a broad set of laboratory note needs in order to generate higher value solutions. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you a perspective on what we are experiencing in our end markets in the second quarter and the environment we are basing our second our forecast on. 
Starting first with the Environmental Health end markets, we again experienced broad base growth during the second quarter driven by continued focus on food safety and investments environmental testing, particularly in developing countries. In addition, the materials and chemical markets were strong. As we look to the second half of 2011, the recently released macroeconomic statistics are concerning and suggest we may continue to experience uneven economic growth. However, we believe that the environmental and food safety end markets will continue to grow despite the challenging economic conditions due to the high priority being placed on these critical needs, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, given the recently introduced new products and strong traction in service, we expect our demand profile to remain similar to the first half. Although organic growth have moderated a bit due to more difficult comparisons resulting in mid-single digit organic growth. 
In human health, the businesses are much less impacted by overall GDP growth and more tied to specific factors like birth rates and Pharma R&D spending. During the first half of this year, birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline slightly, putting pressure on our screen business. Medical Imaging experienced good growth in both diagnostics and our newer applications. Our research business grew in the second quarter largely from new products introduced and good traction in academia, where we have historically been underrepresented. For the second half, we expect growth to gradually improve in diagnostics as U.S. birth rates stabilize, and we continue to expand programs outside the U.S. 
Within our Medical Imaging business, we expect growth from newer applications in markets offset the impact of more modest growth in our traditional diagnostic applications, which are cycling up against comparables in the prior year. Lastly, in our research business, we believe our organic growth will be in the mid-single digits as we continue to migrate our portfolio to higher growth areas and benefit from the increasing expenditures in emerging territories. Accordingly, we are forecasting organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the second half as well as the third quarter. And expect growth to be more consistent across our Human and Environmental Health segments as we progress through the back half. While we are maintaining a cautious outlook regarding the global economic recovery and the corresponding impact to reserve markets, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line and continue to drive operator margin improvement. As a result, we are raising our estimate for full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth of 23% to 26% over the prior year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
Now let me now turn the call to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."
268363,138209772,152738,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone.

And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. 
Before moving to the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease that measured in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another strong quarter revenue and adjusted EPS growth, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue for the second quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 9% in Human Health and environmental health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth with the Americas and Europe going on the low single- digit rate and Asia growing high teens. We also continued to successfully leverage our investments in emerging markets, enabling us to generate another strong quarter of double-digit growth in these key regions. 
For end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within human health reserve, 2 end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue; and research, representing 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a low single-digit rate in the second quarter with solid growth generated from our Medical Imaging business, offset by a modest decline in our screening business. 
Organic revenue and Medical Imaging business grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter despite cycling up against the difficult comparison from the prior year. Solid demand generated from our base medical diagnostics offering, coupled with our continued momentum from industrial and applications, drove outperformance in the period. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, the acquisition of Excella brings complementary imaging technology to further expand our addressable market and diversifying our customer base. In our screening business, demand remains strong with the emerging territories, including China, India and South America as we further broadened our penetration into these key regions with our neonatal and infectious disease screening solutions. This growth was offset by revenue softness within North America, driven primarily by the continued impact of declines in U.S. birth rates and the favorable timing of certain estimate placements in the first quarter. 
Organic revenue for our screening business grew in the low-single digits for the first half of 2011, consistent with our expectations. Organic revenue in our research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter as we continue to experience strong demand from the academic sector across a broad set of technologies within our research portfolio. We saw a good growth for our Operetta imaging systems, gas automation tools, as well as our envision d inspired multi plate readers. This broad base demands illustrate the increasing value that we're able to bring to our economic customers with our highly efficient and integrated instruments, as well as agents to help them solve their most critical research needs. 
We are encouraged by some early indicators of positive trends in the pharmaceuticals sector. Specifically, we're experiencing strong growth in Asia as we capture demand from internal pharmaceutical research migrating to lower cost regions or being outsourced to CIOs. Additionally, we are seeing initial benefits from our customers investment and preclinical research with solid demand for our imaging technology to better understand disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. We expect these trends to persist providing opportunity to offset ongoing challenges and our legacy product offerings particularly our radioactive portfolio. 
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represents 54% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Within environmental health, we serve 3 end markets: Laboratory services, which represents a 25% of total revenue; environmental safety, which represents 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represents a 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our Life Services business grew in a low single-digit range in the second quarter. within service, our OneSource business posted strong top line growth but moderate from prior quarters as we cycled up against a large contract win from the second quarter of 2010. 
Organic revenue in environmental and safety markets grew mid-teens in the second quarter as investments in critical environmental and food safety applications drove strong demand for analytical instrumentation. As Rob mentioned, we have a full suite of new products across our inorganic analysis portfolio to detect 3 metal contaminants such as lead, Cavium, arsenic and mercury, primarily in water, soil and food. The lost of the pinnacle A, we optimize and the Nexion further expand our leadership position in these key technologies with highly efficient easy-to-use instrumentation for detecting some of the most widespread contaminants globally. 
Lastly, organic growth and industrial markets grew low double digits in the second quarter. The strong demand to industrial segment continues to be mostly related to the characterization of materials, chemical processing and imaging applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 14.1%. In the quarter, we benefited from solid incremental flow through on higher sales, strong gains in productivity initiatives as well as minor benefit from the flow-through from foreign exchange given the significant fluctuation year over year. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 120 basis points as compared to the first half of 2010. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.8%, representing a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were offset by unfavorable product mix due to a high percentage of estimate placements as well as growth investments deployed in the quarter. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 13.4% representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced how the volume leverage, the benefit of new products and solid productivity gains. 
GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus the $33.2 million in the second quarter 2010. For the second quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 16%. And in on a non-GAAP basis, our just adjusted tax rate was 25%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in April. This favorability is do primarily to a favorable distribution income in the period. And for the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2011 was $0.25 compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2010. And in the second quarter 2010, as a reminder, other income including pretax gain of $25.6 million or $0.21 per share related to the purchase of the remaining interest in the SCIEX joint venture. Our adjusted EPS was $0.42 in the second quarter of 2011, up 27% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2011 was 113.6 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 112.7 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the second quarter with approximately $276 million of net debt, which we defined as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $176 million as compared to the first quarter of 2011, resulting primarily from payments for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $395 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance in the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $54.9 million as compared to $62.82 million in the second quarter of 2010. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating cash flow impact of the tax impacts associated with the sale of IDS was $110.8 million. Free cash flow, which we defined as adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was down $8.48 million, representing 108% adjusted income.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now like to discuss our third quarter and full year 2011 guidance. Rob mentioned earlier we're maintaining our full year forecast organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range mid-single digits for the third quarter as well. We expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion to be at the high-end of the range of our annual objective of 75 to 100 basis points for 2011 driven predominately by volume leverage and our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising our estimates to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth of 23% to 26% over the prior year. And regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $0.37 to $0.39 range for presenting growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the back over to Dave."

It's one of the reasons why when the stimulus spending a couple of years ago, we didn't see a significant benefit from that. So consequently, we're less impacted. As I sort of mentioned before, I think historically, we've been underrepresented in the academic area of research because a lot of our products were more tailored to Pharma and biotech. It was a strategy of probably about 12 months ago that we started to adjust some of our product portfolio to do better in academic markets. And so we're getting some of the benefit of that. So I still think spending is probably flat to maybe up a little bit across academia.

For us, Europe was sort of low single digits, but we continue to see good strength in Asia. I think what I was across our entire company specifically on the environmental side. But having said that, there's continued demand within both the environmental and the food and consumer areas. I mean, you continue to see whether its regulations or EPA putting out the list of chemicals of concern or the China 5-year plan, including directives and procedures targeted at reducing and monitoring water pollution, the U.K. government laying out specific air quality targets. Of course, you've got the U.S. Food, Safety Modernization Act. So you continue to see a lot of focus and emphasis in this area. That's what I sort of said in my prepared remarks while clearly we think it's going to be a challenging economic environment, particularly, and I said sort of uneven growth, I do think there is high priority being placed on this area. So we're still fairly optimistic that we'll continue to see growth in the broader environmental health arena because of the things I mentioned before."

I think the overall margins we expect to return to positive in the second half for Human Health primarily because we do think there a bit of a pickup in that mix with our is screening business kind of get them up to more of a positive than what was on the second quarter. So I think there's incremental there. And I think we still have very difficult comps in the imaging side. We were up over 20% on net imaging in the third, fourth quarter last year, so I think that's got to be a little offset for that. So I think with those investments and when volumes returning to more of mid-single type growth rate, that's kind of where we think we'll end up."

So I think we still feel pretty good about the demand pattern for the side in the back half. As I said, we're moderating a little bit just relative to the strong second half we had last year. On the service side, if you go back again to the discussion we have before in the '08, '09 timeframe, service business continue to do quite well during that period of time. So it's difficult to say something is immune to the overall macroeconomic environment. But I do think that the service business had done pretty well historically. Now part of that is if you were to sort of separated between classical billable or timing material, I think that does take a little bit of a hit during difficult economic time. What was more than offsetting that during the '08, '09 timeframe was reconsider to expand the OneSource program because of the continued adoption of that, largely within the pharmaceutical industry. So I think the real challenge we're getting in a more difficult environment is will be able to continue to expand our addressable market with OneSource. And when I say that is not only from an industry perspective it's also from a geographic perspective for more than offset but will be some pressure on the historical and time of service."

Reve",1036,"Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continued to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance in both the top and bottom line. Revenue grew 14%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And adjusted EPS grew 27%. We're particularly pleased with the growth year-over-year, as we had some difficult comparisons given the very strong quarter we had in Q2 last year. 
In addition to the strong financial results, in the second quarter, we continued to expand the capabilities of the company and invest to improve our growth profile through acquisitions, as well as internal investments in R&D. In the second quarter, we further expanded our presence in emerging markets, such as China, the Middle East and Africa with targeted applications. In particular, we made good progress with the launch of our new high-sensitivity kits for hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases in China, and experienced strong demand in the Middle East to meet the rising need for better newborn screening capabilities, including a large installation in Saudi Arabia, which follows our major installation in Cairo earlier this year. 
In addition, we obtained our first sickle cell amenia screening orders in Africa, a region with high-incidence levels, to provide earlier diagnosis for management of this disease. We also launched a series of innovations within our market-leading inorganic analysis portfolio, targeted at helping customers ensure safer order, food and pharmaceuticals. The label-free EnSpire plate reader, which we introduced last quarter, continues to experience strong receptivity, as scientists look to improve the discovery of potential new therapeutic targets. 
Our OneSource Laboratory Service business continues to experience good growth and is gaining traction expanding outside of its traditional pharmaceutical base, evidenced by the recent addition of a significant new account in environmental testing. 
During the quarter, we were able to further expand PerkinElmer's current Medical Imaging portfolio with the acquisition of Dexela, providing customers with high-speed, high-resolution CMOS technology. This technology is complementary to our amorphous silicon-based technology in key areas, such as surgery, dental, cardiology and mammography. And as the only provider of both amorphous silicon and CMOS capabilities, we can now provide the technology that best fits our customers' specific applications. 
As I mentioned last quarter, the growing challenge for customers is managing and interpreting large amounts of data. A key area of focus for us is helping customers overcome these data challenges by providing enterprise-wide knowledge solutions. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities in the area of informatics, with the addition of Labtronics, which uniquely positions us to deploying Electronic Laboratory Notebook solution across our global customers' entire value chain, from research to manufacturing. Combined with our service and instrument capabilities, we are increasing our ability to closely collaborate and partner with our customers across a broad set of laboratory note needs in order to generate higher-value solutions. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you a perspective on what we are experiencing in our end markets in the second quarter and the environment we are basing our second our forecast on. 
Starting first with the Environmental Health end markets, we again experienced broad-based growth during the second quarter, driven by continued focus on food safety and investments in environmental testing, particularly in developing countries. In addition, the materials and chemical markets were strong. 
As we look to the second half of 2011, the recently released macroeconomic statistics are concerning and suggest we may continue to experience uneven economic growth. However, we believe that the environmental and food safety end markets will continue to grow, despite the challenging economic conditions due to the high priority being placed on these critical needs, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, given the recently introduced new products and strong traction in service, we expect our demand profile to remain similar to the first half. But organic growth could moderate a bit due to more difficult comparisons, resulting in mid-single digit organic growth. 
In Human Health, the businesses are much less impacted by overall GDP growth and more tied to specific factors like birth rates and pharma R&D spending. During the first half of this year, birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline slightly, putting pressure on our Screening business. 
Medical Imaging experienced good growth on both Diagnostics and our newer applications. Our Research business grew in the second quarter, largely from new products introduced and good traction in academia, where we have historically been underrepresented. For the second half, we expect growth to gradually improve in Diagnostics as U.S. birth rates stabilize, and we continue to expand programs outside the U.S. 
Within our Medical Imaging business, we expect growth from newer applications in markets to offset the impact of more modest growth in our traditional diagnostic applications, which are cycling up against difficult comparables in the prior year. 
Lastly, in our Research business, we believe our organic growth will be in the mid-single digits, as we continue to migrate our portfolio to higher growth areas and benefit from the increasing expenditures in emerging territories. Accordingly, we are forecasting for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the second half as well as the third quarter, and expect growth to be more consistent across our Human and Environmental Health segments as we progress through the back half. 
While we are maintaining a cautious outlook regarding the global economic recovery and the corresponding impact to our served markets, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line and continue to drive operator margin improvement. As a result, we are raising our estimate for full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth of 23% to 26% over the prior year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

And following our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. 
Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease that's measured in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of revenue and adjusted EPS growth, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue for the second quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 9% in Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth, with the Americas and Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high teens. We also continue to successfully leverage our investments in emerging markets, enabling us to generate another strong quarter of double-digit growth in these key regions. 
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we served 2 end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue; and research, representing 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a low single-digit rate in the second quarter, with solid growth generated from our Medical Imaging business, offset by a modest decline in our Screening business. 
Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the difficult comparison from the prior year. Solid demand generated from our base medical diagnostics offering, coupled with our continued momentum from industrial and veterinary applications drove our performance in the period. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, the acquisition of Dexela brings complementary imaging technology to further expand our addressable market and diversifies our customer base. In our Screening business, demand remained strong within the emerging territories, including China, India and South America, as we further broadened our penetration into these key regions with our neonatal and infectious disease screening solutions. This growth was offset by revenue softness within North America, driven primarily by the continued impact of declines in U.S. birth rates and the favorable timing of certain instrument replacements in the first quarter. 
Organic revenue for our Screening business grew in the low-single digits for the first half of 2011, consistent with our expectations. Organic revenue in our Research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter, as we continued to experience strong demand from the academic sector across a broad set of technologies within our research portfolio. We saw a good growth for our Operetta cellular imaging systems, JANUS Automation tools, as well as our EnVision and EnSpire multimode plate readers. This broad-based demands illustrate the increasing value that we were able to bring to our academic customers with our highly efficient and integrated instruments, as well as reagents to help them solve their most critical research needs. 
We are encouraged by some early indicators of positive trends in the pharmaceutical sector. Specifically, we're experiencing strong growth in Asia, as we capture demand from internal pharmaceutical research migrating to lower-cost regions or being outsourced to CROs. Additionally, we're seeing the initial benefits from our customers' investments in preclinical research with solid demand for our in vivo imaging technology to better understand the disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. We expect these trends to persist, providing opportunity to offset ongoing challenges in our legacy product offerings, particularly our radioactive chemical [ph] portfolio. 
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets: Laboratory services, which represented 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our Life Services business grew in the low single-digit range in the second quarter. Within service, our OneSource business posted strong top line growth, but moderate from prior quarters as we cycled up against the large contract win from the second quarter of 2010. 
Organic revenue in environmental and safety markets grew mid-teens in the second quarter as investments in critical environmental and food safety applications drove strong demand for our analytical instrumentation. As Rob mentioned, we have a full suite of new products across our inorganic analysis portfolio to detect trace metal contaminants, such as lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury, primarily in water, soil and food. The lost of the Pinnacle, AA, the Optima ICP 800 and the NexION ICP-MS further expanded our leadership position in these key technologies with highly efficient, easy-to-use instrumentation for detecting some of the most widespread contaminants globally. 
Lastly, organic growth in our industrial markets grew to low-double digits in the second quarter. The strong demand from the Industrial segment continues to be mostly related to the characterization of materials, chemical processing and imaging -- or energy applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 14.1%. In the quarter, we benefited from solid incremental flow-through on higher sales, strong gains on productivity initiatives as well as a minor benefit from the flow-through from foreign exchange, given the significant fluctuation year-over-year. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 120 basis points as compared to the first half of 2010. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.8%, representing a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were offset by unfavorable product mix due to a high percentage of instrument placements as well as growth investments deployed in the quarter. 
In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 13.4%, representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced healthy volume leverage, the benefit of new products and solid productivity gains. 
GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus the $33.2 million in the second quarter 2010. For the second quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 16%. And in on a non-GAAP basis, our just adjusted tax rate was 25%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in April. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. And for the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2011 was $0.25 compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2010. And in the second quarter of 2010, as a reminder, other income included a pretax gain of $25.6 million or $0.21 per share related to the purchase of the remaining interest in the SCIEX joint venture. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.42 in the second quarter of 2011, up 27% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2011 was 113.6 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 112.7 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the second quarter with approximately $276 million of net debt, which we defined as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $176 million as compared to the first quarter of 2011, resulting primarily from payments for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $395 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance in the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $54.9 million as compared to $62.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted for the impact of -- the tax impacts associated with the sale of IDS, was $110.8 million. Free cash flow, which we defined as adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $94.8 million, representing 108% of adjusted income.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, as we continued to drive strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now like to discuss our third quarter and full-year 2011 guidance. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range and mid-single digits for the third quarter as well. We expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion to be at the high end of the range of our annual objective of 75 to 100 basis points for 2011, driven predominately by volume leverage and our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising our estimates to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth at 23% to 26% over the prior year. And regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $0.37 to $0.39 range, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the back over to Dave."

It's one of the reasons why -- when the stimulus spending a couple of years ago, we didn't see a significant benefit from that. So consequently, we're less impacted. As I sort of mentioned before, I think historically, we've been underrepresented in the academic area of research because a lot of our products were more tailored to pharma and biotech. It was a strategy, probably about 12 months ago that we started to adjust some of our product portfolio to do better in academic markets. And so, we're getting some of the benefit of that. So I still think spending is probably flat to maybe up a little bit across academia. I think we're just seeing a little bit of growth relative to, as I said, we're fairly up, underrepresented in that area. So I'm not suggesting that the market is growing much.

I think while that was true across the entire company, that's specifically on the environmental side. But having said that, there's continued demand within both the environmental and the food and consumer areas. I mean, you continue to see, whether its regulations or EPA putting out the list of chemicals of concern or the China 5-year plan, including directives and procedures targeting at reducing and monitoring water pollution, the U.K. government laying out specific air quality targets. Of course, you've got the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act. So you continue to see a lot of focus and emphasis in this area. And that's why I sort of said in my prepared remarks, while clearly, we think it's going to be a challenging economic environment, particularly, and I said sort of uneven growth, I do think there is a high priority being placed on this area.

So I guess I feel pretty good about our position from a portfolio of the end markets we operate in, as well as the position of PerkinElmer within those end markets.

So if you look within the Screening business, we saw good placement of instruments and, again hopefully, that bodes well for the future it usually does carry with a good annuity stream on the consumable and reagent side."

As I said, we're moderating a little bit just relative to the strong second half we had last year. On the Service side, if you go back again to the discussion we have before in the '08, '09 timeframe, Service business continued to do quite well during that period of time. So it's difficult to say something is immune to the overall macroeconomic environment. But I do think that the Service business has done pretty well historically. Now part of that is if you were to sort of separate it between classical, billable or time and material, I think that does take a little bit of a hit during a difficult economic time. What was more than offsetting that during the '08, '09 timeframe was we're continuing to expand the OneSource program because of the continued adoption of that, largely within the pharmaceutical industry. So I think the real challenge, as we get into a more difficult environment is, we'll we be able to continue to expand our addressable market with OneSource?

I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continued to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Reve",1036,"Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continued to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Revenue grew 14%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And adjusted EPS grew 27%. We're particularly pleased with the growth year-over-year, as we had some difficult comparisons given the very strong quarter we had in Q2 last year. 
In addition to the strong financial results, in the second quarter, we continued to expand the capabilities of the company and invest to improve our growth profile through acquisitions, as well as internal investments in R&D. In the second quarter, we further expanded our presence in emerging markets, such as China, the Middle East and Africa with targeted applications. In particular, we made good progress with the launch of our new high-sensitivity kits for hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases in China, and experienced strong demand in the Middle East to meet the rising need for better newborn screening capabilities, including a large installation in Saudi Arabia, which follows our major installation in Cairo earlier this year. 
In addition, we obtained our first sickle cell amenia screening orders in Africa, a region with high-incidence levels, to provide earlier diagnosis for management of this disease. We also launched a series of innovations within our market-leading inorganic analysis portfolio, targeted at helping customers ensure safer order, food and pharmaceuticals. The label-free EnSpire plate reader, which we introduced last quarter, continues to experience strong receptivity, as scientists look to improve the discovery of potential new therapeutic targets. 
Our OneSource Laboratory Service business continues to experience good growth and is gaining traction expanding outside of its traditional pharmaceutical base, evidenced by the recent addition of a significant new account in environmental testing. 
During the quarter, we were able to further expand PerkinElmer's current Medical Imaging portfolio with the acquisition of Dexela, providing customers with high-speed, high-resolution CMOS technology. This technology is complementary to our amorphous silicon-based technology in key areas, such as surgery, dental, cardiology and mammography. And as the only provider of both amorphous silicon and CMOS capabilities, we can now provide the technology that best fits our customers' specific applications. 
As I mentioned last quarter, the growing challenge for customers is managing and interpreting large amounts of data. A key area of focus for us is helping customers overcome these data challenges by providing enterprise-wide knowledge solutions. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities in the area of informatics, with the addition of Labtronics, which uniquely positions us to deploying Electronic Laboratory Notebook solution across our global customers' entire value chain, from research to manufacturing. Combined with our service and instrument capabilities, we are increasing our ability to closely collaborate and partner with our customers across a broad set of laboratory note needs in order to generate higher-value solutions. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you a perspective on what we are experiencing in our end markets in the second quarter and the environment we are basing our second our forecast on. 
Starting first with the Environmental Health end markets, we again experienced broad-based growth during the second quarter, driven by continued focus on food safety and investments in environmental testing, particularly in developing countries. In addition, the materials and chemical markets were strong. 
As we look to the second half of 2011, the recently released macroeconomic statistics are concerning and suggest we may continue to experience uneven economic growth. However, we believe that the environmental and food safety end markets will continue to grow, despite the challenging economic conditions due to the high priority being placed on these critical needs, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, given the recently introduced new products and strong traction in service, we expect our demand profile to remain similar to the first half. But organic growth could moderate a bit due to more difficult comparisons, resulting in mid-single digit organic growth. 
In Human Health, the businesses are much less impacted by overall GDP growth and more tied to specific factors like birth rates and pharma R&D spending. During the first half of this year, birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline slightly, putting pressure on our Screening business. 
Medical Imaging experienced good growth on both Diagnostics and our newer applications. Our Research business grew in the second quarter, largely from new products introduced and good traction in academia, where we have historically been underrepresented. For the second half, we expect growth to gradually improve in Diagnostics as U.S. birth rates stabilize, and we continue to expand programs outside the U.S. 
Within our Medical Imaging business, we expect growth from newer applications in markets to offset the impact of more modest growth in our traditional diagnostic applications, which are cycling up against difficult comparables in the prior year. 
Lastly, in our Research business, we believe our organic growth will be in the mid-single digits, as we continue to migrate our portfolio to higher growth areas and benefit from the increasing expenditures in emerging territories. Accordingly, we are forecasting for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the second half as well as the third quarter, and expect growth to be more consistent across our Human and Environmental Health segments as we progress through the back half. 
While we are maintaining a cautious outlook regarding the global economic recovery and the corresponding impact to our served markets, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line and continue to drive operator margin improvement. As a result, we are raising our estimate for full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth of 23% to 26% over the prior year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."
268363,138209772,152864,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone.

And following our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. 
Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease that's measured in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of revenue and adjusted EPS growth, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue for the second quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 9% in Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth, with the Americas and Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high teens. We also continue to successfully leverage our investments in emerging markets, enabling us to generate another strong quarter of double-digit growth in these key regions. 
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we served 2 end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue; and research, representing 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a low single-digit rate in the second quarter, with solid growth generated from our Medical Imaging business, offset by a modest decline in our Screening business. 
Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the difficult comparison from the prior year. Solid demand generated from our base medical diagnostics offering, coupled with our continued momentum from industrial and veterinary applications drove our performance in the period. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, the acquisition of Dexela brings complementary imaging technology to further expand our addressable market and diversifies our customer base. In our Screening business, demand remained strong within the emerging territories, including China, India and South America, as we further broadened our penetration into these key regions with our neonatal and infectious disease screening solutions. This growth was offset by revenue softness within North America, driven primarily by the continued impact of declines in U.S. birth rates and the favorable timing of certain instrument replacements in the first quarter. 
Organic revenue for our Screening business grew in the low-single digits for the first half of 2011, consistent with our expectations. Organic revenue in our Research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter, as we continued to experience strong demand from the academic sector across a broad set of technologies within our research portfolio. We saw a good growth for our Operetta cellular imaging systems, JANUS Automation tools, as well as our EnVision and EnSpire multimode plate readers. This broad-based demands illustrate the increasing value that we were able to bring to our academic customers with our highly efficient and integrated instruments, as well as reagents to help them solve their most critical research needs. 
We are encouraged by some early indicators of positive trends in the pharmaceutical sector. Specifically, we're experiencing strong growth in Asia, as we capture demand from internal pharmaceutical research migrating to lower-cost regions or being outsourced to CROs. Additionally, we're seeing the initial benefits from our customers' investments in preclinical research with solid demand for our in vivo imaging technology to better understand the disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. We expect these trends to persist, providing opportunity to offset ongoing challenges in our legacy product offerings, particularly our radioactive chemical [ph] portfolio. 
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets: Laboratory services, which represented 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our Life Services business grew in the low single-digit range in the second quarter. Within service, our OneSource business posted strong top line growth, but moderate from prior quarters as we cycled up against the large contract win from the second quarter of 2010. 
Organic revenue in environmental and safety markets grew mid-teens in the second quarter as investments in critical environmental and food safety applications drove strong demand for our analytical instrumentation. As Rob mentioned, we have a full suite of new products across our inorganic analysis portfolio to detect trace metal contaminants, such as lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury, primarily in water, soil and food. The lost of the Pinnacle, AA, the Optima ICP 800 and the NexION ICP-MS further expanded our leadership position in these key technologies with highly efficient, easy-to-use instrumentation for detecting some of the most widespread contaminants globally. 
Lastly, organic growth in our industrial markets grew to low-double digits in the second quarter. The strong demand from the Industrial segment continues to be mostly related to the characterization of materials, chemical processing and imaging -- or energy applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 14.1%. In the quarter, we benefited from solid incremental flow-through on higher sales, strong gains on productivity initiatives as well as a minor benefit from the flow-through from foreign exchange, given the significant fluctuation year-over-year. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 120 basis points as compared to the first half of 2010. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.8%, representing a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were offset by unfavorable product mix due to a high percentage of instrument placements as well as growth investments deployed in the quarter. 
In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 13.4%, representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced healthy volume leverage, the benefit of new products and solid productivity gains. 
GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus the $33.2 million in the second quarter 2010. For the second quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 16%. And in on a non-GAAP basis, our just adjusted tax rate was 25%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in April. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. And for the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2011 was $0.25 compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2010. And in the second quarter of 2010, as a reminder, other income included a pretax gain of $25.6 million or $0.21 per share related to the purchase of the remaining interest in the SCIEX joint venture. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.42 in the second quarter of 2011, up 27% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2011 was 113.6 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 112.7 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the second quarter with approximately $276 million of net debt, which we defined as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $176 million as compared to the first quarter of 2011, resulting primarily from payments for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $395 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance in the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $54.9 million as compared to $62.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted for the impact of -- the tax impacts associated with the sale of IDS, was $110.8 million. Free cash flow, which we defined as adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $94.8 million, representing 108% of adjusted income.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, as we continued to drive strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now like to discuss our third quarter and full-year 2011 guidance. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range and mid-single digits for the third quarter as well. We expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion to be at the high end of the range of our annual objective of 75 to 100 basis points for 2011, driven predominately by volume leverage and our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising our estimates to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth at 23% to 26% over the prior year. And regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $0.37 to $0.39 range, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the back over to Dave."

It's one of the reasons why -- when the stimulus spending a couple of years ago, we didn't see a significant benefit from that. So consequently, we're less impacted. As I sort of mentioned before, I think historically, we've been underrepresented in the academic area of research because a lot of our products were more tailored to pharma and biotech. It was a strategy, probably about 12 months ago that we started to adjust some of our product portfolio to do better in academic markets. And so, we're getting some of the benefit of that. So I still think spending is probably flat to maybe up a little bit across academia. I think we're just seeing a little bit of growth relative to, as I said, we're fairly up, underrepresented in that area. So I'm not suggesting that the market is growing much.

I think while that was true across the entire company, that's specifically on the environmental side. But having said that, there's continued demand within both the environmental and the food and consumer areas. I mean, you continue to see, whether its regulations or EPA putting out the list of chemicals of concern or the China 5-year plan, including directives and procedures targeting at reducing and monitoring water pollution, the U.K. government laying out specific air quality targets. Of course, you've got the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act. So you continue to see a lot of focus and emphasis in this area. And that's why I sort of said in my prepared remarks, while clearly, we think it's going to be a challenging economic environment, particularly, and I said sort of uneven growth, I do think there is a high priority being placed on this area.

So I guess I feel pretty good about our position from a portfolio of the end markets we operate in, as well as the position of PerkinElmer within those end markets. So that's why even though it's a challenging macroeconomic environment, we're still talking about mid-single growth, and we're taking our guidance up."

When we started expanding it to all governments and you get into newborn screening which, of course, in most cases, in the U.S., the newborn screening testing is reimbursed by state governments. And of course, when you get into outside the U.S., a lot of what we do in the screening area is paid ultimately by the government in the various countries. So I guess, if you're just talking about total governments across everything that we do, it's probably 20%, 25% of our revenue."

On the Service side, if you go back again to the discussion we have before in the '08, '09 timeframe, Service business continued to do quite well during that period of time. So it's difficult to say something is immune to the overall macroeconomic environment. But I do think that the Service business has done pretty well historically. Now part of that is if you were to sort of separate it between classical, billable or time and material, I think that does take a little bit of a hit during a difficult economic time. What was more than offsetting that during the '08, '09 timeframe was we're continuing to expand the OneSource program because of the continued adoption of that, largely within the pharmaceutical industry. So I think the real challenge, as we get into a more difficult environment is, we'll we be able to continue to expand our addressable market with OneSource?

On the other hand, on the non-rad side, I think we continue to see good growth there.

I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continued to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Reve",1036,"Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for PerkinElmer. From a financial perspective, we continued to deliver strong results, exceeding our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Revenue grew 14%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And adjusted EPS grew 27%. We're particularly pleased with the growth year-over-year, as we had some difficult comparisons given the very strong quarter we had in Q2 last year. 
In addition to the strong financial results, in the second quarter, we continued to expand the capabilities of the company and invest to improve our growth profile through acquisitions, as well as internal investments in R&D. In the second quarter, we further expanded our presence in emerging markets, such as China, the Middle East and Africa with targeted applications. In particular, we made good progress with the launch of our new high-sensitivity kits for hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases in China, and experienced strong demand in the Middle East to meet the rising need for better newborn screening capabilities, including a large installation in Saudi Arabia, which follows our major installation in Cairo earlier this year. 
In addition, we obtained our first sickle cell anemia screening orders in Africa, a region with high-incidence levels, to provide earlier diagnosis for management of this disease. We also launched a series of innovations within our market-leading inorganic analysis portfolio, targeted at helping customers ensure safer order, food and pharmaceuticals. The label-free EnSpire plate reader, which we introduced last quarter, continues to experience strong receptivity, as scientists look to improve the discovery of potential new therapeutic targets. 
Our OneSource Laboratory Service business continues to experience good growth and is gaining traction expanding outside of its traditional pharmaceutical base, evidenced by the recent addition of a significant new account in environmental testing. 
During the quarter, we were able to further expand PerkinElmer's current Medical Imaging portfolio with the acquisition of Dexela, providing customers with high-speed, high-resolution CMOS technology. This technology is complementary to our amorphous silicon-based technology in key areas, such as surgery, dental, cardiology and mammography. And as the only provider of both amorphous silicon and CMOS capabilities, we can now provide the technology that best fits our customers' specific applications. 
As I mentioned last quarter, the growing challenge for customers is managing and interpreting large amounts of data. A key area of focus for us is helping customers overcome these data challenges by providing enterprise-wide knowledge solutions. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities in the area of informatics, with the addition of Labtronics, which uniquely positions us to deploying Electronic Laboratory Notebook solution across our global customers' entire value chain, from research to manufacturing. Combined with our service and instrument capabilities, we are increasing our ability to closely collaborate and partner with our customers across a broad set of laboratory note needs in order to generate higher-value solutions. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you a perspective on what we are experiencing in our end markets in the second quarter and the environment we are basing our second our forecast on. 
Starting first with the Environmental Health end markets, we again experienced broad-based growth during the second quarter, driven by continued focus on food safety and investments in environmental testing, particularly in developing countries. In addition, the materials and chemical markets were strong. 
As we look to the second half of 2011, the recently released macroeconomic statistics are concerning and suggest we may continue to experience uneven economic growth. However, we believe that the environmental and food safety end markets will continue to grow, despite the challenging economic conditions due to the high priority being placed on these critical needs, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, given the recently introduced new products and strong traction in service, we expect our demand profile to remain similar to the first half. But organic growth could moderate a bit due to more difficult comparisons, resulting in mid-single digit organic growth. 
In Human Health, the businesses are much less impacted by overall GDP growth and more tied to specific factors like birth rates and pharma R&D spending. During the first half of this year, birth rates in the U.S. continued to decline slightly, putting pressure on our Screening business. 
Medical Imaging experienced good growth on both Diagnostics and our newer applications. Our Research business grew in the second quarter, largely from new products introduced and good traction in academia, where we have historically been underrepresented. For the second half, we expect growth to gradually improve in Diagnostics as U.S. birth rates stabilize, and we continue to expand programs outside the U.S. 
Within our Medical Imaging business, we expect growth from newer applications in markets to offset the impact of more modest growth in our traditional diagnostic applications, which are cycling up against difficult comparables in the prior year. 
Lastly, in our Research business, we believe our organic growth will be in the mid-single digits, as we continue to migrate our portfolio to higher growth areas and benefit from the increasing expenditures in emerging territories. Accordingly, we are forecasting for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the second half as well as the third quarter, and expect growth to be more consistent across our Human and Environmental Health segments as we progress through the back half. 
While we are maintaining a cautious outlook regarding the global economic recovery and the corresponding impact to our served markets, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line and continue to drive operator margin improvement. As a result, we are raising our estimate for full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth of 23% to 26% over the prior year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our end market and financial performance in greater detail."

And following our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. 
Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease that's measured in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of revenue and adjusted EPS growth, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue for the second quarter increased by 14%, and organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 9% in Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth, with the Americas and Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high teens. We also continue to successfully leverage our investments in emerging markets, enabling us to generate another strong quarter of double-digit growth in these key regions. 
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we served 2 end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue; and research, representing 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a low single-digit rate in the second quarter, with solid growth generated from our Medical Imaging business, offset by a modest decline in our Screening business. 
Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the difficult comparison from the prior year. Solid demand generated from our base medical diagnostics offering, coupled with our continued momentum from industrial and veterinary applications drove our performance in the period. 
Additionally, as Rob mentioned, the acquisition of Dexela brings complementary imaging technology to further expand our addressable market and diversifies our customer base. In our Screening business, demand remained strong within the emerging territories, including China, India and South America, as we further broadened our penetration into these key regions with our neonatal and infectious disease screening solutions. This growth was offset by revenue softness within North America, driven primarily by the continued impact of declines in U.S. birth rates and the favorable timing of certain instrument replacements in the first quarter. 
Organic revenue for our Screening business grew in the low-single digits for the first half of 2011, consistent with our expectations. Organic revenue in our Research business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter, as we continued to experience strong demand from the academic sector across a broad set of technologies within our research portfolio. We saw a good growth for our Operetta cellular imaging systems, JANUS Automation tools, as well as our EnVision and EnSpire multimode plate readers. This broad-based demands illustrate the increasing value that we were able to bring to our academic customers with our highly efficient and integrated instruments, as well as reagents to help them solve their most critical research needs. 
We are encouraged by some early indicators of positive trends in the pharmaceutical sector. Specifically, we're experiencing strong growth in Asia, as we capture demand from internal pharmaceutical research migrating to lower-cost regions or being outsourced to CROs. Additionally, we're seeing the initial benefits from our customers' investments in preclinical research with solid demand for our in vivo imaging technology to better understand the disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. We expect these trends to persist, providing opportunity to offset ongoing challenges in our legacy product offerings, particularly our radioactive chemical [ph] portfolio. 
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets: Laboratory services, which represented 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our Life Services business grew in the low single-digit range in the second quarter. Within service, our OneSource business posted strong top line growth, but moderate from prior quarters as we cycled up against the large contract win from the second quarter of 2010. 
Organic revenue in environmental and safety markets grew mid-teens in the second quarter as investments in critical environmental and food safety applications drove strong demand for our analytical instrumentation. As Rob mentioned, we have a full suite of new products across our inorganic analysis portfolio to detect trace metal contaminants, such as lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury, primarily in water, soil and food. The lost of the Pinnacle, AA, the Optima ICP 800 and the NexION ICP-MS further expanded our leadership position in these key technologies with highly efficient, easy-to-use instrumentation for detecting some of the most widespread contaminants globally. 
Lastly, organic growth in our industrial markets grew to low-double digits in the second quarter. The strong demand from the Industrial segment continues to be mostly related to the characterization of materials, chemical processing and imaging -- or energy applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 14.1%. In the quarter, we benefited from solid incremental flow-through on higher sales, strong gains on productivity initiatives as well as a minor benefit from the flow-through from foreign exchange, given the significant fluctuation year-over-year. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded 120 basis points as compared to the first half of 2010. 
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.8%, representing a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago. Productivity gains in Human Health were offset by unfavorable product mix due to a high percentage of instrument placements as well as growth investments deployed in the quarter. 
In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 13.4%, representing an increase of 240 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced healthy volume leverage, the benefit of new products and solid productivity gains. 
GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus the $33.2 million in the second quarter 2010. For the second quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 16%. And in on a non-GAAP basis, our just adjusted tax rate was 25%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in April. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. And for the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2011 was $0.25 compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2010. And in the second quarter of 2010, as a reminder, other income included a pretax gain of $25.6 million or $0.21 per share related to the purchase of the remaining interest in the SCIEX joint venture. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.42 in the second quarter of 2011, up 27% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2011 was 113.6 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 112.7 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the second quarter with approximately $276 million of net debt, which we defined as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $176 million as compared to the first quarter of 2011, resulting primarily from payments for acquisitions completed during the period. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $395 million of cash. 
Looking at our cash flow performance in the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $54.9 million as compared to $62.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. For the first half of 2011, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted for the impact of -- the tax impacts associated with the sale of IDS, was $110.8 million. Free cash flow, which we defined as adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $94.8 million, representing 108% of adjusted income.  
In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, as we continued to drive strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now like to discuss our third quarter and full-year 2011 guidance. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range and mid-single digits for the third quarter as well. We expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion to be at the high end of the range of our annual objective of 75 to 100 basis points for 2011, driven predominately by volume leverage and our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising our estimates to the range of $1.64 to $1.68, representing growth at 23% to 26% over the prior year. And regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $0.37 to $0.39 range, representing growth of 19% to 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the back over to Dave."

It's one of the reasons why -- when the stimulus spending a couple of years ago, we didn't see a significant benefit from that. So consequently, we're less impacted. As I sort of mentioned before, I think historically, we've been underrepresented in the academic area of research because a lot of our products were more tailored to pharma and biotech. It was a strategy, probably about 12 months ago that we started to adjust some of our product portfolio to do better in academic markets. And so, we're getting some of the benefit of that. So I still think spending is probably flat to maybe up a little bit across academia. I think we're just seeing a little bit of growth relative to, as I said, we're fairly up, underrepresented in that area. So I'm not suggesting that the market is growing much. I think it's a question of we're probably doing a little bit better."

For us, Europe was, as Andy mentioned, was sort of low-single digits, but we continue to see good strength in Asia. I think while that was true across the entire company, that's specifically on the environmental side. But having said that, there's continued demand within both the environmental and the food and consumer areas. I mean, you continue to see, whether its regulations or EPA putting out the list of chemicals of concern or the China 5-year plan, including directives and procedures targeting at reducing and monitoring water pollution, the U.K. government laying out specific air quality targets. Of course, you've got the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act. So you continue to see a lot of focus and emphasis in this area. And that's why I sort of said in my prepared remarks, while clearly, we think it's going to be a challenging economic environment, particularly, and I said sort of uneven growth, I do think there is a high priority being placed on this area.

So I guess I feel pretty good about our position from a portfolio of the end markets we operate in, as well as the position of PerkinElmer within those end markets. So that's why even though it's a challenging macroeconomic environment, we're still talking about mid-single growth, and we're taking our guidance up."

On the Service side, if you go back again to the discussion we have before in the '08, '09 timeframe, Service business continued to do quite well during that period of time. So it's difficult to say something is immune to the overall macroeconomic environment. But I do think that the Service business has done pretty well historically. Now part of that is if you were to sort of separate it between classical, billable or time and material, I think that does take a little bit of a hit during a difficult economic time. What was more than offsetting that during the '08, '09 timeframe was we're continuing to expand the OneSource program because of the continued adoption of that, largely within the pharmaceutical industry. So I think the real challenge, as we get into a more difficult environment is, we'll we be able to continue to expand our addressable market with OneSource?

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. We report another good report for PerkinElmer, which we successfully delivered strong financial results while continuing to make strategic investments to improve the long-term growth profile of the company. From a financial perspective, revenue grew 8% as reported and 4% organically, despite a very strong Q3 last year in which we grew double digits organically. In addition, adjusted earnings per share increased in the third quarter to $0.41, up 32% from Q3 of last year and exceeded our guidance range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share. 
In the quarter, we experienced continued traction on our margin expansion initiatives with adjusted gross margin expanding by approximately 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margins improved by 45 basis points, despite increased investments in R&D as we continue to focus on expanding our new product pipeline as well as selling and marketing investments to enhance our commercial capabilities primarily in emerging markets.
On a year-to-date basis, our revenue was up 6% organically, adjusted operating margins were up 90 basis points over the prior year and operating cash flow is up over 30%. Additionally, growth in adjusted earnings per share has increased an average of 28% in the last 7 quarters over the respective prior year periods. Given that Andy will discuss our key market segments and financial results in more detail, I'd like to provide a few of the key highlights from the quarter and then focus my remarks on our outlook going forward.
In the third quarter, we experienced growth in all major geographic territories, as well as the majority of our key end markets. Within diagnostics, we continue to benefit from the expansion of programs for both newborn and infectious disease screening, particularly within the emerging territories. Contributing to the solid growth in the period was a key win in Eastern Europe and the continuation of strong demand in Brazil and the Middle East. Additionally, we initiated a collaborative effort with a number of major Japanese universities to develop new methods of detecting radiation in soil, water and food, as well as a guide to develop and monitoring of decontamination method, which resulted in strong demand for our radiometric detection equipment in the period. 
Also, in the quarter, we continue to broaden our OneSource service offering with the addition of an automated system for instrument qualification, [indiscernible] and regulated lab environments. Thereby furthering our commitment to maximize lab productivity for our customers. Additionally, we continued our efforts to expand beyond the pharmaceutical industry with our OneSource service offering and experienced early wins with customers in both environmental and industrial labs. We continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions in areas such as informatics, sample prep and imaging, which will increase our [indiscernible] for our customers and better position us in higher growth markets.
In Q2, we expanded our Medical Imaging growth profile with an acquisition of [indiscernible], which is seeing strong demand including recently winning a contract with a leading diagnostic supplier and a leading orthopedic device company. [indiscernible] also showed terrific growth in both North America and Europe, with its nucleic asset sample preparation solutions and [indiscernible] laboratory [indiscernible] to facilitate their higher throughput applications. Additionally, our informatics acquisitions have demonstrated solid growth and although still early days, are already making us a more important partner to many of our customers.
Our expected acquisition of Caliper Life Sciences will also strengthen our position in the growing area of personalized medicine, as it will bolster our ability to provide customers with an even stronger pipeline of innovation. In particular, Caliper will bring excellent technology across the value chain from in vitro to in vivo imaging, as well as expanded offerings across several of our key end segments. 
Today, Caliper reported another strong quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom line. We remain on track with this transaction and having secured HSR approval and the required financing. I look forward to closing the transaction in the near future.
Now let's turn to the global economic environment and how we believe it will impact PerkinElmer. Starting first with Europe. During the quarter, we is low single-digit growth with much stronger headwinds in the Southern part than the Northern and Central parts. While about 30% of our revenue is from Europe, much of that is an end markets that we do not believe will be significantly impacted by the challenging economic conditions. Furthermore, only about 5% of our revenue is tied directly to European government spending that could be exposed to European government austerity measures.
In the U.S., we experienced mid single-digit growth in the quarter and some into Europe expect that macroeconomic conditions will continue to be challenging. However, we are seeing birthrates improving over last year and continued demand for environmental and safety products to the both growing regulatory requirements and customer seeking to protect their brand reputation. And, of course, our service business provides real stability, as well as terrific access to our customers to expand our commercial relationships.
In the developing parts of the world, which represent about 25% of our revenue, we continue to see strong double-digit growth and expect this to continue. During the quarter, we once again increased our investments in these markets and believe we'll have a great opportunity to leverage our channel capabilities to bring many of the products and technologies we recently acquired to this part of the world.
Through the last several years, we have made a number of changes to our businesses, organization and global footprint, which I believe has resulted in a stronger, more resilient company. As a result, true the nature of our end markets, our global diversity and strong customer relationships, we believe that we can continue to grow should economic conditions become more challenging. As we face the challenge of [indiscernible] manage economic uncertainty while remaining focused on driving growth, our strategy will be to prudently deploy our investments toward growth areas that we believe will create the best long-term returns. However, we will not be immune to the impacts and so we will be prudent with our investments and continue to look for ways to improve our processes and eliminate unnecessary costs. 
As we move into Q4, I'm encouraged by our ability to continue to deliver solid financial results We have a portfolio that is uniquely positioned to capitalize on key trends impacting Human and Environmental Health and most importantly, this is backed by our outstanding team of people around the world.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to get into the financial results and a little bit more detail."

I'm pleased to provide some additional details on our third quarter results and following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about our particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010.
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another solid quarter of growth and revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the third quarter of 2010. Revenue for the third quarter increased by 8% and organic revenue increased by 4%, as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 6% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth with the America's growing at a mid single-digit rate, Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high single-digit with China up over 20%.  Additionally, our presence in emerging markets continues to significantly contribute to our organic revenue growth with these key regions generating another strong quarter of double-digit growth.
From end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve 2 end markets, diagnostics, which represented 29% of total revenue and research, which represented 17% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the third quarter with solid growth generated from both our screening and our imaging businesses in the period. 
Organic revenue at our Screening business grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, as we experienced solid demand across all territories. In the U.S., we experienced healthy growth across all major areas of the portfolio. As discussed in prior quarters, we are seeing improving trends in birthrates, which we estimated as flat in the period, representing a significant improvement from the declines we experienced in 2010 and the first half of 2011 outside of the U.S., we continue to see steady growth within the emerging territories, particularly in China and Brazil as we continue to expand our footprint of screening solutions in these key high-growth areas of the world.
In our Medical Imaging business, organic revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the most difficult quarterly comparison from the prior year. Our penetration in adjacent markets for these key imaging technology continues to benefit the business with very strong demand for industrial and veterinary application in the period. Additionally, we are gaining traction with our CMOS imaging technology, experiencing early wins with our key OEM partners for orthopedic, surgical and industrial applications. The strong growth in adjacent markets offset a modest decline in our base medical diagnostics offering due to the very difficult comparison from the prior year that I mentioned earlier.
Organic revenue in our Research business declined in a low single-digit rate in the third quarter despite continued healthy demand for our preclinical offerings including our Operetta, cellular imaging instrument utilized for in vitro research, as well as strong growth in our fluorescent agents utilized for in vivo imaging. Within the pharmaceuticals sector, we experienced strong growth in China and India and [indiscernible] as we continue to leverage our regional growth investments and benefit from the ongoing CRO outsourcing trend.
We're encouraged by early success in capturing preclinical opportunities, as well as the progress we continue to make in emerging markets. However, during the period, these advances did not completely offset continued soft demand for our pharmaceutical customers in the developed regions of the world, particularly related to our legacy products including our radioisotope portfolios.
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of total revenue in the quarter. within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets, laboratory services, which represented 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low-single digits in the third quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're seeing good traction in our informatics as we begin to be to leverage our broad-based OneSource relationships to increase the knowledge content we are bringing to our customers through our robust enterprisewide software systems.
Our traditional service offering was essentially flat in the period due primarily to difficult comparisons in our OneSource service offering as the business cycled up against a significant contract win in the prior year. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew low-teens in the third quarter as the expanding number of environmental and food safety applications continue to drive strong demand for our [indiscernible] instrumentation and follow-on consumables. We experienced another strong quarter of organic revenue growth from our inorganic analysis offerings as trace metals identification remains a critical component of containment protection for environmental, as well as food and consumer safety applications. Additionally, we experienced healthy growth in our molecular spectroscopy offering utilized primarily for material safety and quality applications.
We believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed, resulting in continued strong demand for our highly efficient analytically sensitive and information-rich testing solutions.
Lastly, organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid-single digits in the third quarter. This industrial demand continues to be primarily associated with materials analysis, chemical processing and semiconductor applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and [indiscernible] platforms.
Looking at our financial performance. Adjusted gross margins expanded 120 basis points due to productivity gains and the favorable impact of acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 45 basis points in the third quarter to 14.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from higher volume, productivity gains, particularly in G&A and lower corporate cost. This impact was offset by growth investments in R&D and our commercial infrastructure in emerging territories, as well as upfront costs related to new product launches, particularly within our Environmental Health segment. 
Year-to-date, during the third quarter of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded approximately 90 basis points, as compared to the same period a year ago, representing the high-end of our stated objective of adjusted operating profit margin expansion of between 75 to 100 basis points.
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.5%, representing an increase of 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Favorable mix and productivity gains in Human Health were offset by growth investments initiated in the period. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 12.2%, representing a decrease of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced strong volume leverage and productivity gains, offset by unfavorable mix between instruments and service, investment in commercial businesses primarily in emerging markets, as well as incremental cost as mentioned previously related to new products.
GAAP operating profit was $34.2 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $41.4 million in the third quarter of 2010. As year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions, we completed earlier in the year. These acquisitions resulted in a reduction in GAAP operating profits due to primarily to higher amortization of intangibles, as well as the accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of CambridgeSoft.
For the third quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 11.9% and on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 24.2%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in August. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. For the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%.
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2011 was $0.24 compared to $0.22 in the third quarter of 2010. Our adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the third quarter of 2011, up 32% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately 113.4 million shares and our ending share count was approximately 112.7 million shares.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $260 million of net debt, which we define as short- and in long-term debt, minus cash. This reflects a decrease in net debt of approximately $16 million, as compared to the second quarter of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $248 million of cash.
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $50 million, as compared to $37 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we issued and sold $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes due November 2021, having a coupon rate of 5%. These proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the Caliper Life Sciences acquisition and for general corporate purposes. As result, our fourth quarter outlook will reflect just over $5 million in additional interest expense.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. Now, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter 2011 guidance.
As we look into fourth quarter of 2011, we are encouraged by the resilience of our portfolio. Most areas of our business continue to grow and experience healthy demand. While we are not ignoring the risk that could arise from the current global economic uncertainty, we firmly believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are expecting our organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, and we are maintaining our full year forecast or organic revenue growth to be in the mid single-digit range.
We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion for the full year to be within the revised guidance range of 75 to 100 basis points, driven predominantly by volume leverage in our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising the bottom end of our estimate from a range of $1.64 to $1.68 to a new range of $1.66 to $1.68, representing growth of 25% to 26% over the prior year.
Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be the range of $0.49 to $0.51. Included in the fourth quarter outlook is approximately $0.03 per share of incremental interest expense, a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share due to a lower tax rate and a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share from the addition of Caliper Life Sciences.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So as I mentioned, 25% of our revenue now sits in development and that's a significant increase over 2008. Also we've seen a bigger increase in the sort of consumable reagents of sulfur aspects of the businesses. So the capital component of our business is much less. So I think it's a combination of factors that lead us to believe that we feel good about the resiliency in a difficult economic situation. I would say the other aspect of it is when you look at the revenue split between sort of capital and consumables and reagents and informatics, it's probably about 60-40.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report another good report for PerkinElmer, which we successfully delivered strong financial results while continuing to make strategic investments to improve the long-term growth profile of the company. From a financial perspective, revenue grew 8% as reported and 4% organically, despite a very strong Q3 last year in which we grew double digits organically. In addition, adjusted earnings per share increased in the third quarter to $0.41, up 32% from Q3 of last year and exceeded our guidance range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share. 
In the quarter, we experienced continued traction on our margin expansion initiatives with adjusted gross margin expanding by approximately 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margins improved by 45 basis points, despite increased investments in R&D as we continue to focus on expanding our new product pipeline as well as selling and marketing investments to enhance our commercial capabilities primarily in emerging markets.
On a year-to-date basis, our revenue was up 6% organically, adjusted operating margins were up 90 basis points over the prior year and operating cash flow is up over 30%. Additionally, growth in adjusted earnings per share has increased an average of 28% in the last 7 quarters over the respective prior year periods. Given that Andy will discuss our key market segments and financial results in more detail, I'd like to provide a few of the key highlights from the quarter and then focus my remarks on our outlook going forward.
In the third quarter, we experienced growth in all major geographic territories, as well as the majority of our key end markets. Within diagnostics, we continue to benefit from the expansion of programs for both newborn and infectious disease screening, particularly within the emerging territories. Contributing to the solid growth in the period was a key win in Eastern Europe and the continuation of strong demand in Brazil and the Middle East. Additionally, we initiated a collaborative effort with a number of major Japanese universities to develop new methods of detecting radiation in soil, water and food, as well as a guide to develop and monitoring of decontamination methods, which resulted in strong demand for our radiometric detection equipment in the period. 
Also, in the quarter, we continue to broaden our OneSource service offering with the addition of an automated system for instrument qualification, applicable and regulated lab environments. Thereby furthering our commitment to maximize lab productivity for our customers. Additionally, we continued our efforts to expand beyond the pharmaceutical industry with our OneSource service offering and experienced early wins with customers in both environmental and industrial labs. We continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions in areas such as informatics, sample prep and imaging, which will increase our relevancy for our customers and better position us in higher growth markets.
In Q2, we expanded our Medical Imaging growth profile with an acquisition of Dexela, which is seeing strong demand, including recently winning a contract with a leading diagnostic supplier and a leading orthopedic device company. Chemagen also showed terrific growth in both North America and Europe, with its nucleic acid sample preparation solutions as laboratories seek ways to facilitate their higher throughput applications. Additionally, our informatics acquisitions have demonstrated solid growth and although still early days, are already making us a more important partner to many of our customers.
Our expected acquisition of Caliper Life Sciences will also strengthen our position in the growing area of personalized medicine, as it will bolster our ability to provide customers with an even stronger pipeline of innovation. In particular, Caliper will bring excellent technology across the value chain from in vitro to in vivo imaging, as well as expanded offerings across several of our key end segments. 
Today, Caliper reported another strong quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom line. We remain on track with this transaction and having secured HSR approval and the required financing. I look forward to closing the transaction in the near future.
Now let's turn to the global economic environment, and how we believe it will impact PerkinElmer. Starting first with Europe. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit growth with much stronger headwinds in the Southern part than the Northern and Central parts. While about 30% of our revenue is from Europe, much of that is an end markets that we do not believe will be significantly impacted by the challenging economic conditions. Furthermore, only about 5% of our revenue is tied directly to European government spending that could be exposed to European government austerity measures.
In the U.S., we experienced mid single-digit growth in the quarter, and similar to Europe, expect that macroeconomic conditions will continue to be challenging. However, we are seeing birth rates improving over last year and continued demand for environmental and safety products to the both growing regulatory requirements and customer seeking to protect their brand reputation. And, of course, our service business provides real stability, as well as terrific access to our customers to expand our commercial relationships.
In the developing parts of the world, which represent about 25% of our revenue, we continue to see strong double-digit growth and expect this to continue. During the quarter, we once again increased our investments in these markets, and believe we'll have a great opportunity to leverage our channel capabilities to bring many of the products and technologies we recently acquired to this part of the world.
Through the last several years, we have made a number of changes to our businesses, organization and global footprint, which I believe has resulted in a stronger, more resilient company. As a result, true to the nature of our end markets, our global diversity and strong customer relationships, we believe that we can continue to grow should economic conditions become more challenging. As we face the challenge of how to manage economic uncertainty while remaining focused on driving growth, our strategy will be to prudently deploy our investments toward growth areas, and we believe will create the best long-term returns. However, we will not be immune to the impacts, and so we will be prudent with our investments and continue to look for ways to improve our processes and eliminate unnecessary costs. 
As we move into Q4, I'm encouraged by our ability to continue to deliver solid financial results. We have a portfolio that is uniquely positioned to capitalize on key trends impacting Human and Environmental Health and most importantly, this is backed by our outstanding team of people around the world.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to get into the financial results in a little bit more detail."
268363,141402533,184627,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide some additional details on our third quarter results and following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenev",1817,"Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide some additional details on our third quarter results and following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about our particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010.
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another solid quarter of growth and revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the third quarter of 2010. Revenue for the third quarter increased by 8% and organic revenue increased by 4%, as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 6% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth with the America's growing at a mid single-digit rate, Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high single-digit, with China up over 20%.  Additionally, our presence in emerging markets continues to significantly contribute to our organic revenue growth with these key regions generating another strong quarter of double-digit growth.
From end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve 2 end markets, diagnostics, which represented 29% of total revenue; and research, which represented 17% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the third quarter with solid growth generated from both our screening and our Medical Imaging businesses in the period. 
Organic revenue at our Screening business grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, as we experienced solid demand across all territories. In the U.S., we experienced healthy growth across all major areas of the portfolio. As discussed in prior quarters, we are seeing improving trends in birth rates, which we estimated as flat in the period, representing a significant improvement from the declines we experienced in 2010 and the first half of 2011. Outside of the U.S., we continue to see steady growth within the emerging territories, particularly in China and Brazil as we continue to expand our footprint of screening solutions in these key high-growth areas of the world.
In our Medical Imaging business, organic revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the most difficult quarterly comparison from the prior year. Our penetration in adjacent markets for these key imaging technology continues to benefit the business with very strong demand for industrial and veterinary application in the period. Additionally, we're gaining traction with our CMOS imaging technology, experiencing early wins with our key OEM partners for orthopedic, surgical and industrial applications. The strong growth in adjacent markets offset a modest decline in our base medical diagnostics offering due to the very difficult comparison from the prior year that I mentioned earlier.
Organic revenue in our Research business declined in a low single-digit rate in the third quarter despite continued healthy demand for our preclinical offerings including our Operetta, cellular imaging instrument utilized for in vitro research, as well as strong growth in our fluorescent agents utilized for in vivo imaging. Within the pharmaceuticals sector, we experienced strong growth in China and India in the period, as we continued to leverage our regional growth investments and benefit from the ongoing CRO outsourcing trend.
We're encouraged by early success in capturing preclinical opportunities, as well as the progress we continue to make in emerging markets. However, during the period, these advances did not completely offset continued soft demand for our pharmaceutical customers in the developed regions of the world, particularly related to our legacy products including our radioisotope portfolios.
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of total revenue in the quarter. within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets, laboratory services, which represented a 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low-single digits in the third quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're seeing good traction in our informatics as we begin to be to leverage our broad-based OneSource relationships to increase the knowledge content we are bringing to our customers through our robust enterprise-wide software systems.
Our traditional service offering was essentially flat in the period due primarily to difficult comparisons in our OneSource service offering as the business cycled up against a significant contract win in the prior year. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew low-teens in the third quarter as the expanding number of environmental and food safety applications continue to drive strong demand for our analytical instrumentation and follow-on consumables. We experienced another strong quarter of organic revenue growth from our inorganic analysis offering, since trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminate protection for environmental, as well as food and consumer safety applications. Additionally, we experienced healthy growth in our molecular spectroscopy offering utilized primarily for material safety and quality applications.
We believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed, resulting in continued strong demand for a highly efficient, analytically sensitive and information-rich testing solutions.
Lastly, organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid-single digits in the third quarter. This industrial demand continues to be primarily associated with materials analysis, chemical processing and semiconductor applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance. Adjusted gross margins expanded 120 basis points due to productivity gains and the favorable impact of acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 45 basis points in the third quarter to 14.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from higher volume, productivity gains, particularly in G&A and lower corporate cost. This impact was offset by growth investments in R&D and our commercial infrastructure in emerging territories, as well as upfront costs related to new product launches, particularly within our Environmental Health segment. 
Year-to-date, during the third quarter of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded approximately 90 basis points, as compared to the same period a year ago, representing the high end of our stated objective of adjusted operating profit margin expansion of between 75 to 100 basis points.
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.5%, representing an increase of 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Favorable mix and productivity gains in Human Health were offset by growth investments initiated in the period. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 12.2%, representing a decrease of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced strong volume leverage and productivity gains, offset by unfavorable mix between instruments and service, investment in commercial businesses primarily in emerging markets, as well as incremental cost as mentioned previously related to new products.
GAAP operating profit was $34.2 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $41.4 million in the third quarter of 2010. As year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions, we completed earlier in the year. These acquisitions resulted in a reduction in GAAP operating profits due to primarily to higher amortization of intangibles, as well as the purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of CambridgeSoft.
For the third quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 11.9% and on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 24.2%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in August. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. For the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%.
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2011 was $0.24 compared to $0.22 in the third quarter of 2010. Our adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the third quarter of 2011, up 32% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately 113.4 million shares and our ending share count was approximately 112 million -- 112.7 million shares.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $260 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects a decrease in net debt of approximately $16 million, as compared to the second quarter of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $248 million of cash.
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $50 million, as compared to $37 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we issued and sold $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes due November 2021, having a coupon rate of 5%. These proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the Caliper Life Sciences acquisition and for general corporate purposes. As result, our fourth quarter outlook will reflect just over $5 million in additional interest expense.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. Now I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter 2011 guidance.
As we look into fourth quarter of 2011, we are encouraged by the resilience of our portfolio. Most areas of our business continue to grow and experience healthy demand. While we are not ignoring the risk that could arise from the current global economic uncertainty, we firmly believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are expecting our organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, and we are maintaining our full year forecast or organic revenue growth to be in the mid single-digit range.
We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion for the full year to be within the revised guidance range of 75 to 100 basis points, driven predominantly by volume leverage in our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising the bottom end of our estimate from a range of $1.64 to $1.68 to a new range of $1.66 to $1.68, representing growth of 25% to 26% over the prior year.
Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. Included in the fourth quarter outlook is approximately $0.03 per share of incremental interest expense, a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share due to a lower tax rate and a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share from the addition of Caliper Life Sciences.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So as I mentioned, 25% of our revenue now sits in developing, and that's a significant increase over 2008. Also, we've seen a bigger increase in the sort of consumable reagents and software aspects of the businesses. So the capital component of our business is much less. So I think it's a combination of factors that lead us to believe that we feel good about the resiliency in a difficult economic situation. I would say the other aspect of it is when you look at the revenue split between sort of capital and consumables and reagents and informatics, it's probably about 60-40. However, when you look at the profitability, it's more like 75-25. So if you can imagine, our consumable reagents and software businesses are much more profitable. So again, I think -- and again, that's a change over 2008.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report another good quarter for PerkinElmer, which we successfully delivered strong financial results while continuing to make strategic investments to improve the long-term growth profile of the company. From a financial perspective, revenue grew 8% as reported and 4% organically, despite a very strong Q3 last year in which we grew double digits organically. In addition, adjusted earnings per share increased in the third quarter to $0.41, up 32% from Q3 of last year and exceeded our guidance range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share. 
In the quarter, we experienced continued traction on our margin expansion initiatives with adjusted gross margin expanding by approximately 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margins improved by 45 basis points, despite increased investments in R&D as we continue to focus on expanding our new product pipeline as well as selling and marketing investments to enhance our commercial capabilities primarily in emerging markets.
On a year-to-date basis, our revenue was up 6% organically, adjusted operating margins were up 90 basis points over the prior year and operating cash flow is up over 30%. Additionally, growth in adjusted earnings per share has increased an average of 28% in the last 7 quarters over the respective prior year periods. Given that Andy will discuss our key market segments and financial results in more detail, I'd like to provide a few of the key highlights from the quarter and then focus my remarks on our outlook going forward.
In the third quarter, we experienced growth in all major geographic territories, as well as the majority of our key end markets. Within diagnostics, we continue to benefit from the expansion of programs for both newborn and infectious disease screening, particularly within the emerging territories. Contributing to the solid growth in the period was a key win in Eastern Europe and the continuation of strong demand in Brazil and the Middle East. Additionally, we initiated a collaborative effort with a number of major Japanese universities to develop new methods of detecting radiation in soil, water and food, as well as a guide to develop and monitoring of decontamination methods, which resulted in strong demand for our radiometric detection equipment in the period. 
Also, in the quarter, we continue to broaden our OneSource service offering with the addition of an automated system for instrument qualification, applicable and regulated lab environments. Thereby furthering our commitment to maximize lab productivity for our customers. Additionally, we continued our efforts to expand beyond the pharmaceutical industry with our OneSource service offering and experienced early wins with customers in both environmental and industrial labs. We continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions in areas such as informatics, sample prep and imaging, which will increase our relevancy for our customers and better position us in higher growth markets.
In Q2, we expanded our medical imaging growth profile with an acquisition of Dexela, which is seeing strong demand, including recently winning a contract with a leading diagnostic supplier and a leading orthopedic device company. Chemagen also showed terrific growth in both North America and Europe, with its nucleic acid sample preparation solutions as laboratories seek ways to facilitate their higher throughput applications. Additionally, our informatics acquisitions have demonstrated solid growth and although still early days, are already making us a more important partner to many of our customers.
Our expected acquisition of Caliper Life Sciences will also strengthen our position in the growing area of personalized medicine, as it will bolster our ability to provide customers with an even stronger pipeline of innovation. In particular, Caliper will bring excellent technology across the value chain from in vitro to in vivo imaging, as well as expanded offerings across several of our key end segments. 
Today, Caliper reported another strong quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom line. We remain on track with this transaction and having secured HSR approval and the required financing. I look forward to closing the transaction in the near future.
Now let's turn to the global economic environment, and how we believe it will impact PerkinElmer. Starting first with Europe. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit growth with much stronger headwinds in the southern part than the northern and central parts. While about 30% of our revenue is from Europe, much of that is in end markets that we do not believe will be significantly impacted by the challenging economic conditions. Furthermore, only about 5% of our revenue is tied directly to European government spending that could be exposed to European government austerity measures.
In the U.S., we experienced mid single-digit growth in the quarter, and similar to Europe, expect that macroeconomic conditions will continue to be challenging. However, we are seeing birth rates improving over last year and continued demand for environmental and safety products due to the both growing regulatory requirements and customers seeking to protect their brand reputation. And, of course, our service business provides real stability, as well as terrific access to our customers to expand our commercial relationships.
In the developing parts of the world, which represent about 25% of our revenue, we continue to see strong double-digit growth and expect this to continue. During the quarter, we once again increased our investments in these markets, and believe we will have a great opportunity to leverage our channel capabilities to bring many of the products and technologies we recently acquired to this part of the world.
Through the last several years, we have made a number of changes to our businesses, organization and global footprint, which I believe has resulted in a stronger, more resilient company. As a result, due to the nature of our end markets, our global diversity and strong customer relationships, we believe that we can continue to grow should economic conditions become more challenging. As we face the challenge of how to manage economic uncertainty while remaining focused on driving growth, our strategy will be to prudently deploy our investments toward growth areas that we believe will create the best long-term returns. However, we will not be immune to the impacts, and so we will be prudent with our investments and continue to look for ways to improve our processes and eliminate unnecessary costs. 
As we move into Q4, I'm encouraged by our ability to continue to deliver solid financial results. We have a portfolio that is uniquely positioned to capitalize on key trends impacting Human and Environmental Health and most importantly, this is backed by our outstanding team of people around the world.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to get into the financial results in a little bit more detail."
268363,141402533,184750,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone.

Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenev",1824,"Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide some additional details on our third quarter results and following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I'd like to clarify that whenever I talk about our particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010.
As Rob just discussed, we were pleased to deliver another solid quarter of growth and revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, particularly considering the difficult comparisons from the third quarter of 2010. Revenue for the third quarter increased by 8%, and organic revenue increased by 4%, as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 2% and 6% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. All major geographies contributed to our organic revenue growth with the America's growing at a mid single-digit rate, Europe growing at a low single-digit rate and Asia growing high single-digits, with China up over 20%.  Additionally, our presence in emerging markets continues to significantly contribute to our organic revenue growth with these key regions generating another strong quarter of double-digit growth.
From an end-market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve 2 end markets, diagnostics, which represented 29% of total revenue; and research, which represented 17% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate in the third quarter with solid growth generated from both our screening and our Medical imaging businesses in the period. 
Organic revenue at our screening business grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, as we experienced solid demand across all territories. In the U.S., we experienced healthy growth across all major areas of the portfolio. As discussed in prior quarters, we are seeing improving trends in birth rates, which we estimated as flat in the period, representing a significant improvement from the declines we experienced in 2010 and the first half of 2011. Outside of the U.S., we continue to see steady growth within the emerging territories, particularly in China and Brazil as we continue to expand our footprint of screening solutions in these key high-growth areas of the world.
In our medical imaging business, organic revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, despite cycling up against the most difficult quarterly comparison from the prior year. Our penetration in adjacent markets for this key imaging technology continues to benefit the business with very strong demand for industrial and veterinary applications in the period. Additionally, we were gaining traction with our CMOS imaging technology, experiencing early wins with our key OEM partners for orthopedic, surgical and industrial applications. The strong growth in adjacent markets offset a modest decline in our base medical diagnostics offering due to the very difficult comparison from the prior year that I mentioned earlier.
Organic revenue in our research business declined in a low single-digit rate in the third quarter despite continued healthy demand for our preclinical offerings including our Operetta, cellular imaging instrument utilized for in vitro research, as well as strong growth in our fluorescent agents utilized for in vivo imaging. Within the pharmaceuticals sector, we experienced strong growth in China and India in the period, as we continued to leverage our regional growth investments and benefit from the ongoing CRO outsourcing trend.
We're encouraged by our early success in capturing preclinical opportunities, as well as the progress we continue to make in emerging markets. However, during the period, these advances did not completely offset continued soft demand for our pharmaceutical customers in the developed regions of the world, particularly related to our legacy products including our radioisotope portfolios.
Let's turn now to Environmental Health, which represented 54% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Environmental Health, we served 3 end markets, laboratory services, which represented a 25% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 20% of total revenue and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. Organic revenue in our lab services business grew low-single digits in the third quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we're seeing good traction in our informatics as we begin to be to leverage our broad-based OneSource relationships to increase the knowledge content we are bringing to our customers through our robust enterprise-wide software systems.
Our traditional service offering was essentially flat in the period due primarily to difficult comparisons in our OneSource service offering as the business cycled up against a significant contract win in the prior year. Organic revenue in our environmental and safety markets grew low-teens in the third quarter as the expanding number of environmental and food safety applications continue to drive strong demand for our analytical instrumentation and follow-on consumables. We experienced another strong quarter of organic revenue growth from our inorganic analysis offering, since trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminate protection for environmental, as well as food and consumer safety applications. Additionally, we experienced healthy growth in our molecular spectroscopy offering utilized primarily for material safety and quality applications.
We believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed, resulting in continued strong demand for a highly efficient, analytically sensitive and information-rich testing solutions.
Lastly, organic revenue in our industrial markets grew mid-single digits in the third quarter. This industrial demand continues to be primarily associated with materials analysis, chemical processing and semiconductor applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms. 
Looking at our financial performance. Adjusted gross margins expanded 120 basis points due to productivity gains and the favorable impact of acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 45 basis points in the third quarter to 14.2%. In the quarter, we benefited from higher volume, productivity gains, particularly in G&A and lower corporate cost. This impact was offset by growth investments in R&D and our commercial infrastructure in emerging territories, as well as upfront costs related to new product launches, particularly within our Environmental Health segment. 
Year-to-date, during the third quarter of 2011, adjusted operating profit margins expanded approximately 90 basis points, as compared to the same period a year ago, representing the high end of our stated objective of adjusted operating profit margin expansion of between 75 to 100 basis points.
In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were 19.5%, representing an increase of 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Favorable mix and productivity gains in Human Health were offset by growth investments initiated in the period. In our Environmental Health segment, adjusted operating profit margins were 12.2%, representing a decrease of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Within this segment, we experienced strong volume leverage and productivity gains, offset by unfavorable mix between instruments and service, investments in commercial resources primarily in emerging markets, as well as incremental cost as mentioned previously related to new products.
GAAP operating profit was $34.2 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $41.4 million in the third quarter of 2010. As year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions we completed earlier in the year. These acquisitions resulted in a reduction in GAAP operating profits due to primarily to higher amortization of intangibles, as well as the purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of CambridgeSoft.
For the third quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 11.9%, and on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 24.2%, which is favorable to our guidance communicated in August. This favorability is due primarily to a favorable distribution of income in the period. For the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%.
GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2011 was $0.24 compared to $0.22 in the third quarter of 2010. Our adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the third quarter of 2011, up 32% from the prior year. Our weighted average diluted share count to the third quarter of 2011 was approximately 113.4 million shares and our ending share count was approximately 112 million -- 112.7 million shares.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $260 million of net debt, which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects a decrease in net debt of approximately $16 million, as compared to the second quarter of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $248 million of cash.
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $50 million, as compared to $37 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we issued and sold $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes due November 2021, having a coupon rate of 5%. These proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the Caliper Life Sciences acquisition and for general corporate purposes. As result, our fourth quarter outlook will reflect just over $5 million in additional interest expense.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to drive strong growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. Now I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter 2011 guidance.
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2011, we are encouraged by the resilience of our portfolio. Most areas of our business continue to grow and experience healthy demand. While we are not ignoring the risk that could arise from the current global economic uncertainty, we firmly believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are expecting our organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, and we are maintaining our full year forecast or organic revenue growth to be in the mid single-digit range.
We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion for the full year to be within the revised guidance range of 75 to 100 basis points, driven predominantly by volume leverage in our multiyear productivity initiatives. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share for 2011, we are raising the bottom end of our estimate from a range of $1.64 to $1.68 to a new range of $1.66 to $1.68, representing growth of 25% to 26% over the prior year.
Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. Including in -- Included in the fourth quarter outlook is approximately $0.03 per share of incremental interest expense, a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share due to a lower tax rate and a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share from the addition of Caliper Life Sciences.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So as I mentioned, 25% of our revenue now sits in developing, and that's a significant increase over 2008. Also, we've seen a bigger increase in the sort of consumable reagents and software aspects of the businesses. So the capital component of our business is much less. So I think it's a combination of factors that leads us to believe that we feel good about the resiliency in a difficult economic situation. I would say the other aspect of it is when you look at the revenue split between sort of capital and consumables and reagents and informatics, it's probably about 60-40. However, when you look at the profitability, it's more like 75-25. So as you can imagine, our consumable reagents and software businesses are much more profitable. So again, I think this -- and again, that's a change over 2008. So I think it continues to have sort to be supported by strong financial results even though macroeconomic conditions are challenging right now."
