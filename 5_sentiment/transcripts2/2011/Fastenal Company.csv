I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grow our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%.",1201,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grow our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%. We didn't see a little bit of softness in November, but it bounce back nicely in December and actually had a strong month from start to finish. 
The positive things about our sales growth is that the growth is widespread. We're seeing good growth in almost all regions of the country, geographic areas. Our international businesses is doing very well. The business grew over 30% for the year, and we have a lot of good things going on in the international side. So we're very excited about that and about the good domestic growth.
As the company reported 44.8% pretax growth for 2010. And for the fourth quarter, we hit right at 50%, very proud of those numbers. We've worked very hard at that. On the non-earning side, it was a little low because our tax rate was slightly higher for the year. We had 43.9% earnings growth for the year and 46.3% for the quarter, both solid numbers. 
A lot of the earnings growth was driven because of the nice job we did on expense control. Our SG&A for the year overall expenses for the year were up 8.5%. For the quarter, it went a little higher at 15.1%. Dan is going to touch a little bit on that as we go into the call. 
Some of the expenses I was really excited about. On a non-payroll expense for the year was actually flat to down slightly. It was basically flat for the year. Really good job by the team working on everything we could do and working hard to control that.
With the payroll expense, we were only up 8 1/2% and that was driven by commissions and bonuses rebounding from our 2009 expenses. Other areas in the expense category that I think we did a very nice job on, the first will be distribution. Distribution expense is the closest expense we have related to the physical movement of product. You move more product, you move more way, you spend more money. It's pretty straightforward. But our group worked really hard in implementing some new software, some new ideas, some better ways of doing business and it grew our business by 17% and grew their expenses by less than 4% in the warehouse side of our business. And really proud of those numbers, so I left that at the end of the year and proud of the team that did that. 
On the transportation side, it's also very physical part of our business, moving weight just as I've said many times. The products we sell is pretty inexpensive by the pound. We sell processed steel. Our transportation group did a nice job in an environment were they feel prices were rising and actually turned the profit for the company after you considered putting all the credits we received from suppliers for whole product, the charges we charge the customers from delivering product, it netted out in our expenses. It netted out that we actually had a profit for the year. And I think in all three of the last three quarters, we turned the profit in freight. So another job well done by the people in the transportation department.
As far as hiring, we did hire about 700 sales people throughout the year. People within our stores. Going forward, we will continue to add people into our store and sales operations. And right now, what we're planning for is the ads people in the stores about 60% to 70% the rate of our sales growth. So if you look at the fourth quarter, it's easy to do the math. We'll probably add 13% to 14% additional store people if we continue to grow at about the rate we're growing today. If we were to accelerate out of that, we would increase. And if we were to slowdown, we would bring that back trying to manage our expense. 
On the support personnel side, which makes up approximately 30% of our labor force today, we will add some people in 2011. We've been tight for the last two years. Our plan there is to add support personnel at half or less the rate of sales. So again, looking at where we are with the month-to-month release so it's pretty easy to figure out what our plan is.
Store openings, we had a strong finish on the store openings that was really designed in the beginning of the year, trying to understand how the year was going to play out. The year played out well. So we increased our openings in the second half. Going forward, our plan for 2011 is to open between 149 and 200 stores, which is a 6% to 8% range. We may round that up to 150 to 200, it sounds better Dan. So we're optimistic and we're going to open stores. We believe it's one of the course to our growth strategy.
Switching to 'pathway to profit'. 'Pathway to profit' for those of who that aren't familiar is our strategic growth plan that we laid out in 2007. And what I like to say is we're back on the course for the 'pathway to profit'. With the profit improvements that we've identified through this slowdown over the last two years, found new ways of doing business, ways of saving money, we now believe that we're going to achieve the 23% pretax number with a lower average store size. If you recall, when we first laid this out, we had said we needed to achieve an average store size 125,000 per store per month. 
Looking at our current release we just put out today, if you look at that data, it shows that we really need to be at about $100,000 to $110,000 per month looking at those numbers to achieve a 23% pretax rate, and we're comfortable that these numbers are sustainable going forward. If nothing else, we might be able to improve them slightly. Based on that, we should be able to achieve the $100,000 to $110,000 average store size in 2013, bringing the 'pathway to profit' timeline back a couple of years from what we have stated six to  nine months ago.
And so we are very excited about that. One of the great benefits of 'pathway to profit' is the return on the business that we get -- return on invested capital assets equity. However, you look at the pretax moves up, the return gets moved up like it has a lever on it because it's a great advantage there. 
So before I close and hand it over to Dan, I just want to let you know that as an organization, we're starting out the year with a very high level of optimism and focus. And we're just really excited about going into the new year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. And then when he's done, we're going to answer some questions."
270747,118142275,91985,"Fastenal Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2011",2011-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I just want to touch on highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.First off on is to reiterate Wi",1676,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I just want to touch on highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.
First off on is to reiterate Will's point. If you look at Page 1, one item I'd like to highlight is as Will mentioned, November stood a little bit in our trend, but December snapback nicely. And I'm pleased to say, when I look at our various group of stores and I look at our 2-plus group, the fact that we were 16.8% growth in that group in the final month of the year is a nice way to end the year and launch into the new year. So I'm pleased with the recovery in December and nice sales number for the entire quarter.
When I look into the document a little bit and I get into Pages 2 and 3, and we started looking at some of the sequential patterns and started talking about the year ago on this call and a little more detail to try to explain or for us to try to understand what was really happening as we went through the downturn and then the recovering of the model to our business. As you saw back in February, those little weather weakness. But other than that month, we are at or above trend at every month as we progress on our January, October pattern and prepare ourselves for 2011.
And continuing unto Page 4, that chart that lays out the patterns in our Manufacturing and Non-Res Construction business. Manufacturing, as we have talked about in 2009 have bottomed out earlier in the year and was performing quite well towards the tail end of '09 and then to 2010. If I look at the trend pattern, bottom Page 4, I see that the Non-Res Construction and I look at in comparison to pre-slowdown. So I look at it in October 2008 timeframe. We've been slowly inching back as we go through the year back to that benchmark pattern from 2008. And I feel again, I believe that position us well going into the new year.
One other item I touched on is when I look out 2010 and in 2009, we have pulled back quite aggressively in our headcount to manage through the downturn, and we saw some weakening in our active accounts as a result. When I look at Q4 2010, it's our strongest quarter for the year in active account growth. And again I believe all those things lined up to bode well as we begin the new year.
Page 5, as Will mentioned on the 'pathway to profit', that table we have, 'pathway to profit' starts on Page 5. The table we have on Page 7, really touches on what Will was pointing out is that when we started the 'pathway to profit', our target $125,000 a month in average sales for our store group. We felt would yield a 23% operating margin, pretax margin for the company. With the improvements we've made on the operating expense side, this despite a weakening in our gross margin as we went through 2009 and saw some recovery in 2010, despite that, we're able to improve the relative profitability of the various groups such that we look at it now and say $100,000 to $110,000 is a reasonable range were we can hope to achieve the 23% operating margin. And what that does is it shortens up the amount of time that possible event push back by the recession. 
One other item I'd point out is for the benefit of the reader is on Page 6. We changed the display of how we show that table, and we now have broken out what we not only store personnel but non-store selling personnel. Because I think it's an important item to note the selling energy and the investments we're making into the selling energy both in 2010 and as we progress through and report our 2011 numbers, it just brings that clarity to where we're adding resources.
If I look at the support area and I ignore the distribution and manufacturing and look at true administrative support, you would see that like we talked back in 2007 as we slowdown the store openings and focus our energy on growing the stores, growing the headcount per store, growing the business per store, the amount of overhead, true overhead we had as an organization, really holds pretty confident because the individual business units are levering up and you see that in our administrative personnel in that timeframe, which is essentially flat over the last three years.
Finally, operating and administrative expenses as Will mentioned, we feel we managed that well as we went into 2010. In the release on Page 9, we mentioned that some of the changes in the cost components. One item that I point out, I think it's useful for the reader to understand is when we look at -- we've always indicated and you can read in our proxy, you can read it in a lot of our filings, we are a very entrepreneal organization. We reward for growth. There's two sides to that coin in 2009, we saw it and a lot of it. Everybody within Fastenal had a tremendous belt-tightening, personally. As we went through 2009 as the incentive compensation dried up. 
In 2010 that expanded quite nicely. And if you look at our increase in payroll cost for 2010 and you quantify the pieces, about 75% of the increase in payroll costs in 2010 is solely related to incentive comp, commissions paid to personnel at our store, incentive bonuses paid to our district leadership, regional leadership, support infrastructure, distribution personal, administrative personnel, et cetera, all of those combined bonuses and then the final one on form match [ph] , all those pieces, the expansion of that resulted in 75% of our expense growth and payroll. The other 25% was related to the actual adding of people and working more hours throughout the year as our business grew.
One other item I feel compelled to mention. Just for clarity to our operating expenses as well. Last week, we've put out a press release indicating we had settled a dispute that we had with the Department of Justice as related to our GSA Hardware contract. And in our release last week, we indicated that we settled for $6.25 million, $3.5 million of that settlement is recorded in our fourth quarter numbers. Approximately $2 million was recorded in our third quarter numbers, and I think that sort of point out number one for the community to understand the numbers and for our shoulders in general. If I look at that and say it wasn't there, the $3.5 million within 100% disappear, between 80% and 85% of it would. And the balance that wouldn't disappear would be the additional dollars that would've been paid out in incentive compensation. And so that was felt by everybody within the organization in the fourth quarter.
One other item that I would mention and again I feel compelled only from the standpoint of for those of you who own our stock over the years, had the opportunity to directly meet with Bob Vulcan in the past, Will Oberton in the present. One thing you know about Fastenal is in our course of business, operating in a very ethical and force-right manner, and we're proud of that. And two items cited by DOJ in their press release last week. We take excess into, we believe over the course of the contract that we acted in good faith and we priced our product accordingly in terms of the contract. The second item they cite was is that we know and we sold import product. That statement actually is true. In the contract, that was admissible because it was a walk-in contract, the hardware contract were the customer would come in and buy product and it was broken out in the contract that the buyer was responsible for determining the country of origin. We did sell that product when the customer came in. We reported that in our reporting to the government, and we think that was appropriate in the context of the contract. But we agreed to disagree, we settled it and now we move forward. And I'm glad it's behind us, and we can move forward in 2011.
The final item I'll touch on is on Page 11 and that relates to cash flow. Sorry, it's not on the call but I don't touch on cash flow sometime during the context of the conversation. Again, I'll frame it back when we started 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, in that meeting that we had with our shareholders, we talked about the 'pathway to profit' what we're hoping to accomplish from a standpoint of profitability. We also touched on what we hope to accomplish from the standpoint of cash flow. In that discussion, we said generally speaking, our target was to have operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings at at least 85%. In 2010, we came in at 90.6%. We also talked about that spending somewhere in the 25% of earnings in the form of capital expenditures. So if you take the 85% back off to 25%, our goal would be to have approaching a 60% of our earnings available in free cash flow to use for other purposes that might be returning to our shareholders that might be other investors and opportunities that come along.
In 2010, we spent about 26% of our earnings in that CapEx, leaving 64.5% of our earnings available as free cash flow. We paid out 68.9% of our earnings so we depleted our cash flow as we went through the year. But a very, very strong cash flow and I believe again that touch well as we enter into 2011.
With that, I will turn it over for questions."

I think what really drives our ability to manage as we go through that mix is the job our procurement group has done over time of building a nice offering of products. If you look through our catalog, great selection of products, great talent of sourcing. And we've done a nice job adding exclusive brands. And it still as a percentage of our sales is relative -- if you ignore the faster piece, it's still relatively small, but it's been building every year.

In 2010, our biggest initiatives for adding government sales reps, manufacturing sales reps and sales reps selling our vending systems. But none of those showed up in our sales investments and they are purely a sales investment. And even over or above those, the cost of keeping those people on the road. And so we really want to give the clearest picture that we can of what we're doing. And the reason we chose to put a lot of investment into those areas is it's the greatest way to lever our sales. Going into 2010, we weren't sure what the economy was going to bring us and the business was going to do. So we really look hard, and we said, we think we can get a better boost in our business by putting sales specialist above the store umbrella and driving business to the store than the entry level sales people doing it one small account at a time. They're both important. But if you only have so many people add, we felt this was our best investment. And so we wanted to state that and the way you look at our sales investments in our releases."

There were small price increases coming through from the middle of the year. But for the most part, they were smaller categories, and we're putting up the iron and holding them back and doing the [ph] price increases coming. But with all our prices going up, the plastic products and other products go up. So right now, we are seeing more price increases coming through. We're mitigating them as well as we can. And going into the year, the cost will go up some. We'll put inventory cycle, it's going to take -- that will be coming through the end of the first quarter going into the summer months. On the non-fastener products, we also are trying to push price increases sooner than that but it always takes time. On the fastener products, the steel has been kind of a roller coaster lately. The U.S. steel is way up. Asian steel has not risen as much. But our pricing manager just got back from a week in Asia and everyone selling and prices are going to be going up. One of the things that's really thrown to us now is the flooding in Australia because the coaking compound that they need for making steel comes from Australia. No one quite knows how that's going to effect things yet. We don't know if that's real or just a hype to push up steel. So we're going to be watching it very closely. We have a lot of people in the ground over there. And as soon as prices start going up, we're going to push up with them. If anything, we think it's a positive for our business going forward as long as it doesn't get too crazy. But pricing is really visible. So if I were have to guess, I would say we have above average inflation in 2011 from what we're seeing today. I do not predict at this time that it would look like 2008, but it's really too early to say that."

And what you saw as we went through 2009, that kept getting a little of the way. And then as we get into 2010, that snapback nicely in the first six months and we're at or slightly above that level as we end the year, which again, puts us in a nice position for the new year. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece that we talked about, when you look at when there is some inflation going on, when there is some completely pricing. One of the things that people sometimes don't like about our business is the fact that our inventory turns about twice a year. Unfortunately, for us our gross margins make it provide for us to get a great return still on that inventory. In a period of deflating times, as we saw in 2009, it beats the heck out of us because you're selling higher price product on the shelf for quite a few months into a weakening marketplace. And in a marketplace, where prices are going up, six months of inventory and maybe 10 or 11 months of import inventory place a little bit better and it affords you the opportunity to see the pricing changes as they're happening to have a better plan for how you're going to react to that price increase or price change. And it allows you a three to seven-month window of some pricing flexibility."

In 2011, we're coming to the year, we say based on all these things, what's a reasonable range for growth? We think that's a reasonable range. If you look at that and say the economy is stronger with some inflation, we would hope that would be a range that we would be at the high-end of our meeting. If the economy would take a dip down or deflation, which I'd surprised by but those kind of things happened, it beats you up towards the lower end. But I can't cite for you the fact that we assume this kind of GDB growth. What I will say is we do pay attention to realize them.

So we're working hard to put our energy, our sales energy into those types of projects that the healthcare energy things like that. If it were to come back stronger, if the economy picks up and people start bringing up the market, there's no question it would help our business because it's a big sector that's pretty soft. Margin is about a portion between manufacturing and big constructions, there wouldn't be much there. But it would really just hopefully push us up above the numbers that we're talking about.

Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%. We didn't see a little bit of softness in November, but it bounced back nicely in December and actually had a strong month from start to finish. 
The positive things about our sales growth is that the growth is widespread. We're seeing good growth in almost all regions of the country, geographic areas. Our international businesses is doing very well. The business grew over 30% for the year, and we have a lot of good things going on in the international side. So we're very excited about that and about the good domestic growth.
As the company reported 44.8% pretax growth for 2010. And for the fourth quarter, we hit right at 50%. I'm very proud of those numbers. We've worked very hard at that. On the net earnings side, it was a little low because our tax rate was slightly higher for the year. We had 43.9% earnings growth for the year and 46.3% for the quarter, both solid numbers. 
A lot of the earnings growth was driven because of the nice job we did on expense control. Our SG&A for the year overall expenses for the year were up 8.5%. For the quarter, it went a little higher at 15.1%. Dan is going to touch a little bit on that as we go into the call. 
Some of the expenses that I was really excited about. On a non-payroll expense for the year was actually flat to down slightly. It was basically flat for the year. Really good job by the team working on everything we could do and working hard to control that.
With the payroll expense, we were only up 8.5% but that was driven by commissions and bonuses rebounding from our 2009 expenses. Other areas in the expense category that I think we did a very nice job on, the first would be distribution. Distribution expense is the closest expense we have related to the physical movement of product. You move more product, you move more weight, you spend more money. It's pretty straightforward. But our group worked really hard at implementing some new software, some new ideas, some better ways of doing business and it grew our business by 17%, and grew their expenses by less than 4% in the warehouse side of our business. And really proud of those numbers, so I left that at the end of the year and proud of the team that did that. 
On the transportation side, it's also a very physical part of our business, moving weight because as I've said many times. The products we sell is pretty inexpensive by the pound. We sell processed steel. Our transportation group did a nice job in an environment where they feel prices were rising and actually turned the profit for the company after you considered putting all the credits we received from suppliers for holding product fee, charges we charge the customers for delivering product, it netted out in our expenses. It netted out that we actually had a profit for the year. And I think, in the whole three of the last three quarters, we turned the profit in freight. So I know they're job well done by the people in the transportation department.
As far as hiring, we did hire about 700 sales people throughout the year. People within our stores. Going forward, we will continue to add people into our store and sales operations. And right now, what we're planning for is the ads people in the stores at about 60% to 70% the rate of our sales growth. So if you look at the fourth quarter, it's easy to do the math. We'll probably add 13% to 14% additional store people if we continue to grow at about the rate we're growing today. If we were to accelerate out of that, we would increase. And if we were to slowdown, we would bring that back trying to manage our expense. 
On the support personnel side, which makes up approximately 30% of our labor force today, we will add some people in 2011. We've been tight for the last few years. Our plan there is to add support personnel at half or less the rate of sales. So again, looking at where we are with the month-to-month releases, so it's pretty easy to figure out what our plan is.
Our store openings, we had a strong finish on the store openings that was really designed in the beginning of the year, trying to understand how the year was going to play out. The year played out well. So we increased our openings in the second half. Going forward, our plan for 2011 is to open between 149 and 200 stores, which is a 6% to 8% range. We may round that up to 150 to 200, it sounds better Dan. So we're optimistic and we're going to open stores. We believe it's one of the course to our growth strategy.
Switching to 'pathway to profit'. 'Pathway to profit' for those of who you that aren't familiar is our strategic growth plan that we laid out in 2007. And what I'd like to say is we're back on course for the 'pathway to profit'. With the profit improvements that we've identified through this slowdown over the last two years, found new ways of doing business, ways of saving money. We now believe that we're going to achieve the 23% pretax number with a lower average store size. If you recall, when we first laid this out, we had said we needed to achieve an average store size of 125,000 per store per month. 
Looking at our current release we just put out today, if you look at that data, it shows that we really need to be at about $100,000 to $110,000 per month looking at those numbers to achieve a 23% pretax rate, and we're comfortable that these numbers are sustainable going forward. If nothing else, we might be able to improve them slightly. Based on that, we should be able to achieve the $100,000 to $110,000 average store size in 2013, bringing the 'pathway to profit' timeline back a couple of years from what we have stated six to  nine months ago.
And so we are very excited about that. One of the great benefits of 'pathway to profit' is the return on the business that we get -- the return on invested capital assets equity. However, you look at it when the pretax moves up, the return gets moved up like it has a lever on it because there's a great advantage there. 
So before I close and hand it over to Dan, I just want to let you know that as an organization, we're starting out the year with a very high level of optimism and focus. And we're just really excited about going into the new year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. And then when he's done, we'll answer some questions."

And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.First off on is to reiterate about Will'",1693,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.
First off on is to reiterate about Will's point. If you look at Page 1, one item I'd just like to highlight is as Will mentioned, November stoop a little bit in our trend, but December snapback nicely. And I'm pleased to say, when I look at our various group of stores and I look at our two-plus group, the fact that we were at 16.8% growth in that group in the final month of the year. It's a nice way to end the year and launch into the new year. So I'm pleased with the recovery in December and nice sales number for the entire quarter.
When I look into the document a little bit and I get into Pages 2 and 3, and we started looking at some of the sequential patterns that I started talking about a year ago on this call, and a little more detail to try to explain or treat for us to try to understand what was really happening as we went through the downturn and then the recovering of the model to our business. As you saw back in February, those little weather weakness, but other than that month, we are at or above trend at every month as we progress on our January, October pattern and prepare ourselves for 2011.
And continuing unto Page 4, that chart that lays out the patterns in our Manufacturing and Non-Res Construction business. Manufacturing, as we have talked about in 2009 have bottomed out earlier in the year and was performing quite well towards the tail end of '09 and then to 2010. If I look at the trend pattern at the bottom of Page 4, I'd see that the Non-Res Construction and I look at it in comparison to pre-slowdown. So I look at it in October 2008 timeframe. We've been slowly inching back as we go through the year back to that benchmark pattern from 2008. And I feel again, I believe that position us well going into the new year.
One other item I'd touched on is when I look at 2010 and in 2009, we have pulled back quite aggressively and our headcount have managed through the downturn, and we've saw some weakening in our active account growth as a result. When I look at Q4 2010, it's our strongest quarter for the year in active account growth. And again, I believe all those things lined up to bode well as we begin the new year.
Page 5, as Will mentioned on the 'pathway to profit', that table we have, 'pathway to profit' starts on Page 5. The table we have on Page 7, really touches on what Will was pointing out is that when we started the 'pathway to profit', our target $125,000 a month in average sales for our store group. We felt would yield a 23% operating margin, pretax margin for the company. With the improvements we've made on the operating expense side and this despite a weakening in our gross margin as we went through 2009. And saw some recovery in 2010, despite that, we're able to improve the relative profitability of the various groups such that we look at it now and say $100,000 to $110,000 is a reasonable range where we can hope to achieve the 23% operating margin. And what that does is it shortens up the amount of time that possible event push back by the recession. 
One other item I'd point out is for the benefit of the reader is on Page 6. We changed the display of how we show that table, and we now have broken out what we not only store personnel but non-store selling personnel. Because I think it's an important item to note the selling energy and reinvestments we're making into the selling energy both in 2010. And as we progress through and report our 2011 numbers, it just brings added clarity to where we're adding resources.
If I look at the support area and I ignore the distribution and manufacturing, I look at true administrative support, you would see that like we talked about back in 2007, as we slowdown the store openings and focus our energy on growing the stores, growing the headcount per store, growing the business per store, the amount of overhead, true overhead we have as an organization, really holds pretty constant because the individual business units are levering up. And you see that in our administrative personnel in that timeframe, which is essentially flat over the last three years.
Finally, operating and administrative expenses. As Will mentioned, we feel we've managed that well as we went through 2010. In the release on Page 9, we mentioned that some of the changes in the cost components. One item that I'd point out, I think it's useful for the reader to understand is that when we look at -- we've always indicated and you can read in our proxy, you can read it in a lot of our filings, we are a very entrepreneurial organization. We reward for growth. There's two sides to that coin in 2009, we saw it and a lot of it. Everybody within Fastenal had a tremendous belt-tightening, personally, as they went through 2009 as the incentive compensation dried up. 
In 2010 that expanded quite nicely. And if you look at our increase in payroll cost for 2010 and you quantify the pieces, about 75% of the increase in payroll costs in 2010 is solely related to incentive comp, commissions paid to personnel at our store, incentive bonuses paid to our district leadership, regional leadership, support infrastructure, distribution personal, administrative personnel, et cetera, all of those combined bonuses and then the final one on 41K match, all those pieces, the expansion of that resulted in 75% of our expense growth and payroll. The other 25% was related to the actual adding of people and working more hours throughout the year as our business grew.
One other item I feel compelled to mention. Just for clarity to our operating expenses as well. Last week, we've put out a press release indicating we had settled a dispute that we had with the Department of Justice, as related to our GSA hardware contract. And in our release last week, we indicated that we settled for $6.25 million. A $3.5 million of that settlement is recorded in our fourth quarter numbers. Approximately $2 million was recorded in our third quarter numbers, and I think that sort of point out number one, for the analyst community to understand the numbers, and for our shareholders in general. If I look at that and say that it wasn't there, the $3.5 million wouldn't a 100% disappear, but between 80% and 85% of it would. And the balance that wouldn't disappear would be the additional dollars that would've been paid out in incentive compensation. And so that was felt by everybody within the organization in the fourth quarter.
One other item that I would mention and again, I feel compelled only from the standpoint of. For those of you that have owned our stock over the years, I'm happy I have the opportunity to directly meet with Bob Kerlin in the past, Will Oberton in the present. One thing you know about Fastenal is in our course of business, operating in a very ethical and force-right manner, and we're proud of that. And two items cited by the DOJ in their press release last week we take excess into. We believe over the course of the contract that we acted in good faith and we priced our product accordingly in terms of the contract. The second item they cite was that we know and we sold import product. That statement actually is true. In the contract, that was admissible because it was a walk-in contract, the hardware contract, where a customer would come in and buy product. And it was broken out in the contract but the buyer was responsible for determining country of origin. We did sell that product when the customer came in. We reported that in our reporting to the government, and we think that was appropriate in context to the contract. But we agreed to disagree, we settled it and now we move forward. And I'm glad it's behind us, so we can move forward in 2011.
The final item I'll touch on is on Page 11 and that relates to cash flow. Sorry, there isn't a call where I don't at least touch on cash flow sometime during the context of the conversation. Again, I'll frame it back when we started 'pathway to profit' back in 2007. In that meeting that we had with our shareholders, we talked about the 'pathway to profit' what we're hoping to accomplish from standpoint of profitability. We also touched on what we hope to accomplish from the standpoint of cash flow. 
In that discussion, we've said generally speaking, our target was to have operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings at least 85%. In 2010, we came in at 90.6%. We also talked about that spending somewhere in the 25% of earnings in the form of capital expenditures. So if you take the 85% back off to 25%, our goal would be to have approaching a 60% of our earnings available in free cash flow to use for other purposes that might be returning to our shareholders that might be other investing opportunities that come along.
In 2010, we've spent about 26% of our earnings in net cap of CapEx, leaving 64.5% of our earnings available as free cash flow. We paid out 68.9% of our earnings so we depleted our cash flow, but it has went through the year. But a very, very strong cash flow and I believe, again, that starts well as we enter into 2011.
With that, I will now turn it over for questions."

I think what really drives our ability to manage as we go through that mix is the job our procurement group has done over time of building a nice offering of products. If you look through our catalog, great selection of products, great job of outsourcing. And we've done a nice job adding exclusive brands. And it still as a percentage of our sales is relative -- if you ignore the faster piece, it's still relatively small, but it's been building every year. And I think that puts us in position to maintain and improve that 52% as we move into the new year."

In 2010, our biggest initiatives were adding government sales reps, manufacturing sales reps and sales reps selling our vending systems. But none of those showed up in our sales investments and they're purely a sales investment. And even over and above those, the cost of keeping those people on the road. And so we really want to give the clearest picture that we can of what we're doing. And the reason we chose is to put a lot of investment into those areas is that it's the greatest way to lever our sales. Going into 2010, we weren't sure what the economy was going to bring us and the business was going to do. So we really look hard, and we said, we think we can get a better boost in our business by putting sales specialist above the store umbrella and driving business to the store than the entry level sales people doing it one small account at a time. They're both important. But if you only have so many people to add, we felt this was our best investment.

There were small price increases coming through from the middle of the year. But for the most part, they were smaller categories, and we are putting up the iron and holding them back kind of doing the haise man [ph] on the price increases coming. But with oil prices going up, the plastic products and other products go up. So right now, we are seeing more price increases coming through. We're mitigating them as well as we can. And going into the year, the cost will go up some. We'll put inventory cycle, it's going to take -- that will be coming through more by the end of the first quarter going into the summer months on the non-fastener products. We're also are trying to push price increases sooner than that but it always takes time. On the fastener products, the steel has been, it's kind of been a roller coaster lately. The U.S. steel is way up. Asian steel has not risen as much. But our purchasing manager just got back from a week in Asia and everyone is selling and prices are going to be going up. One of the things that's really thrown at us now is the flooding in Australia because the coaking compound that they need for making steel comes from Australia. No one quite knows how that's going to effect things yet. We don't know if that's real or just a hype to push up steel. So we're going to be watching it very closely. We have a lot of people on the ground over there. And as soon as prices start going up, we're going to push up with them. If anything, we think it's a positive for our business going forward as long as it doesn't get too crazy. But pricing is really visible. So if I were have to guess, I would say we'd have above average inflation in 2011 from what we're seeing today.

So we'll see how things play out as far as how we return dollars to our shoulders. But unfortunately, we're in the position where we have a nice strong free cash flow to do either or. But in 2010 and for the most part 2009, we chose to just to return dollars to our shoulders as a dividend."

A big chunk of our business and part of it is the way you look at the data, you measure the data, we use mix codes unless you would suspect.

And then as we got into 2010, that snapback nicely in the first six months and we're at or slightly above that level as we end the year, which again, puts us in a nice position for the new year. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece that we've talked about, when you look at when there is some inflation going on, when there is some fluidity to pricing. One of the things that people sometimes don't like about our business is the fact that our inventory turns about twice a year. Unfortunately, for us our gross margins make it provide for us to get a great return still on that inventory. In a period of deflating times, as we saw in 2009, that beats the heck out of us because you're selling higher price product on the shelf for quite a few months into a weakening marketplace. And in a marketplace, where our prices are going up, six months of inventory and maybe 10 or 11 months of import inventory place a little bit better. And it affords you the opportunity to see the pricing changes as they're happening to have a better plan for how you're going to react to that price increase or price change. And it allows you a three to seven-month window of some pricing flexibility."

We kind of look at all those pieces, and we say based on this, what do we think is a reasonable way to plan our business? And plan our business for the new year just as we did coming into 2010. In 2011, we're coming to the year, we say based on all these things, what's a reasonable range for growth? We think that's a reasonable range. If you look at that and say the economy is stronger or there's some inflation, we would hope that would be at range that we would be at the high-end of that bidding. If the economy were to take a dip down or deflation, which I'd surprised by but if those kind of things happened, it beats you up towards the lower end. But I can't cite for you the fact that we assume this kind of GDP growth. What I will say is we do pay attention to realize them. If we see an ISM [Institute for Supply Management] number that were all of a sudden change appreciatively that tend to lead our business by about three months.

While it's very weak on the Non-Res Construction would be anything to do with retail. Very little housing being built kind of the private sector business, non-energy private sectors is very slow. We don't see that coming back. When you look at the releases coming from the targets and the people like that, they're not planning on ramping up their store openings anytime soon or most of them are not. So we're going to work hard to put our sales energy into those types of projects that the healthcare energy things like that. If it were to come back stronger, if the economy picks up and people start bringing up the market books [ph], there's no question it would help our business because it's a big sector that's pretty soft. Margin is about a portion between manufacturing and big constructions, there wouldn't be much there. But it would really just hopefully push us up above the numbers that we're talking about. And I think that's basically Dan just said is that we got to boost from something like a sector or just the overall economy. We should see it moving up.

I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%.",1211,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%. We didn't see a little bit of softness in November, but it bounced back nicely in December and actually had a strong month from start to finish. 
The positive things about our sales growth is that the growth is widespread. We're seeing good growth in almost all regions of the country, geographic areas. Our international businesses is doing very well. The business grew over 30% for the year, and we have a lot of good things going on in the international side. So we're very excited about that and about the good domestic growth.
As the company reported 44.8% pretax growth for 2010. And for the fourth quarter, we hit right at 50%. I'm very proud of those numbers. We've worked very hard at that. On the net earnings side, it was a little low because our tax rate was slightly higher for the year. We had 43.9% earnings growth for the year and 46.3% for the quarter, both solid numbers. 
A lot of the earnings growth was driven because of the nice job we did on expense control. Our SG&A for the year overall expenses for the year were up 8.5%. For the quarter, it went a little higher at 15.1%. Dan is going to touch a little bit on that as we go into the call. 
Some of the expenses that I was really excited about. On a non-payroll expense for the year was actually flat to down slightly. It was basically flat for the year. Really good job by the team working on everything we could do and working hard to control that.
With the payroll expense, we were only up 8.5% but that was driven by commissions and bonuses rebounding from our 2009 expenses. Other areas in the expense category that I think we did a very nice job on, the first would be distribution. Distribution expense is the closest expense we have related to the physical movement of product. You move more product, you move more weight, you spend more money. It's pretty straightforward. But our group worked really hard at implementing some new software, some new ideas, some better ways of doing business and it grew our business by 17%, and grew their expenses by less than 4% in the warehouse side of our business. And really proud of those numbers, so I left that at the end of the year and proud of the team that did that. 
On the transportation side, it's also a very physical part of our business, moving weight because as I've said many times. The products we sell is pretty inexpensive by the pound. We sell processed steel. Our transportation group did a nice job in an environment where they feel prices were rising and actually turned the profit for the company after you considered putting all the credits we received from suppliers for holding product fee, charges we charge the customers for delivering product, it netted out in our expenses. It netted out that we actually had a profit for the year. And I think, in the whole three of the last three quarters, we turned the profit in freight. So I know they're job well done by the people in the transportation department.
As far as hiring, we did hire about 700 sales people throughout the year. People within our stores. Going forward, we will continue to add people into our store and sales operations. And right now, what we're planning for is the ads people in the stores at about 60% to 70% the rate of our sales growth. So if you look at the fourth quarter, it's easy to do the math. We'll probably add 13% to 14% additional store people if we continue to grow at about the rate we're growing today. If we were to accelerate out of that, we would increase. And if we were to slowdown, we would bring that back trying to manage our expense. 
On the support personnel side, which makes up approximately 30% of our labor force today, we will add some people in 2011. We've been tight for the last few years. Our plan there is to add support personnel at half or less the rate of sales. So again, looking at where we are with the month-to-month releases, so it's pretty easy to figure out what our plan is.
Our store openings, we had a strong finish on the store openings that was really designed in the beginning of the year, trying to understand how the year was going to play out. The year played out well. So we increased our openings in the second half. Going forward, our plan for 2011 is to open between 149 and 200 stores, which is a 6% to 8% range. We may round that up to 150 to 200, it sounds better Dan. So we're optimistic and we're going to open stores. We believe it's one of the course to our growth strategy.
Switching to 'pathway to profit'. 'Pathway to profit' for those of who you that aren't familiar is our strategic growth plan that we laid out in 2007. And what I'd like to say is we're back on course for the 'pathway to profit'. With the profit improvements that we've identified through this slowdown over the last two years, found new ways of doing business, ways of saving money. We now believe that we're going to achieve the 23% pretax number with a lower average store size. If you recall, when we first laid this out, we had said we needed to achieve an average store size of 125,000 per store per month. 
Looking at our current release we just put out today, if you look at that data, it shows that we really need to be at about $100,000 to $110,000 per month looking at those numbers to achieve a 23% pretax rate, and we're comfortable that these numbers are sustainable going forward. If nothing else, we might be able to improve them slightly. Based on that, we should be able to achieve the $100,000 to $110,000 average store size in 2013, bringing the 'pathway to profit' timeline back a couple of years from what we have stated six to  nine months ago.
And so we are very excited about that. One of the great benefits of 'pathway to profit' is the return on the business that we get -- the return on invested capital assets equity. However, you look at it when the pretax moves up, the return gets moved up like it has a lever on it because there's a great advantage there. 
So before I close and hand it over to Dan, I just want to let you know that as an organization, we're starting out the year with a very high level of optimism and focus. And we're just really excited about going into the new year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. And then when he's done, we'll answer some questions."
270747,118142275,92134,"Fastenal Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2011",2011-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.First off on is to reiterate about Will'",1693,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.
First off on is to reiterate about Will's point. If you look at Page 1, one item I'd just like to highlight is as Will mentioned, November stoop a little bit in our trend, but December snapback nicely. And I'm pleased to say, when I look at our various group of stores and I look at our two-plus group, the fact that we were at 16.8% growth in that group in the final month of the year. It's a nice way to end the year and launch into the new year. So I'm pleased with the recovery in December and nice sales number for the entire quarter.
When I look into the document a little bit and I get into Pages 2 and 3, and we started looking at some of the sequential patterns that I started talking about a year ago on this call, and a little more detail to try to explain or treat for us to try to understand what was really happening as we went through the downturn and then the recovering of the model to our business. As you saw back in February, those little weather weakness, but other than that month, we are at or above trend at every month as we progress on our January, October pattern and prepare ourselves for 2011.
And continuing unto Page 4, that chart that lays out the patterns in our Manufacturing and Non-Res Construction business. Manufacturing, as we have talked about in 2009 have bottomed out earlier in the year and was performing quite well towards the tail end of '09 and then to 2010. If I look at the trend pattern at the bottom of Page 4, I'd see that the Non-Res Construction and I look at it in comparison to pre-slowdown. So I look at it in October 2008 timeframe. We've been slowly inching back as we go through the year back to that benchmark pattern from 2008. And I feel again, I believe that position us well going into the new year.
One other item I'd touched on is when I look at 2010 and in 2009, we have pulled back quite aggressively and our headcount have managed through the downturn, and we've saw some weakening in our active account growth as a result. When I look at Q4 2010, it's our strongest quarter for the year in active account growth. And again, I believe all those things lined up to bode well as we begin the new year.
Page 5, as Will mentioned on the 'pathway to profit', that table we have, 'pathway to profit' starts on Page 5. The table we have on Page 7, really touches on what Will was pointing out is that when we started the 'pathway to profit', our target $125,000 a month in average sales for our store group. We felt would yield a 23% operating margin, pretax margin for the company. With the improvements we've made on the operating expense side and this despite a weakening in our gross margin as we went through 2009. And saw some recovery in 2010, despite that, we're able to improve the relative profitability of the various groups such that we look at it now and say $100,000 to $110,000 is a reasonable range where we can hope to achieve the 23% operating margin. And what that does is it shortens up the amount of time that possible event push back by the recession. 
One other item I'd point out is for the benefit of the reader is on Page 6. We changed the display of how we show that table, and we now have broken out what we not only store personnel but non-store selling personnel. Because I think it's an important item to note the selling energy and reinvestments we're making into the selling energy both in 2010. And as we progress through and report our 2011 numbers, it just brings added clarity to where we're adding resources.
If I look at the support area and I ignore the distribution and manufacturing, I look at true administrative support, you would see that like we talked about back in 2007, as we slowdown the store openings and focus our energy on growing the stores, growing the headcount per store, growing the business per store, the amount of overhead, true overhead we have as an organization, really holds pretty constant because the individual business units are levering up. And you see that in our administrative personnel in that timeframe, which is essentially flat over the last three years.
Finally, operating and administrative expenses. As Will mentioned, we feel we've managed that well as we went through 2010. In the release on Page 9, we mentioned that some of the changes in the cost components. One item that I'd point out, I think it's useful for the reader to understand is that when we look at -- we've always indicated and you can read in our proxy, you can read it in a lot of our filings, we are a very entrepreneurial organization. We reward for growth. There's two sides to that coin in 2009, we saw it and a lot of it. Everybody within Fastenal had a tremendous belt-tightening, personally, as they went through 2009 as the incentive compensation dried up. 
In 2010 that expanded quite nicely. And if you look at our increase in payroll cost for 2010 and you quantify the pieces, about 75% of the increase in payroll costs in 2010 is solely related to incentive comp, commissions paid to personnel at our store, incentive bonuses paid to our district leadership, regional leadership, support infrastructure, distribution personal, administrative personnel, et cetera, all of those combined bonuses and then the final one on 41K match, all those pieces, the expansion of that resulted in 75% of our expense growth and payroll. The other 25% was related to the actual adding of people and working more hours throughout the year as our business grew.
One other item I feel compelled to mention. Just for clarity to our operating expenses as well. Last week, we've put out a press release indicating we had settled a dispute that we had with the Department of Justice, as related to our GSA hardware contract. And in our release last week, we indicated that we settled for $6.25 million. A $3.5 million of that settlement is recorded in our fourth quarter numbers. Approximately $2 million was recorded in our third quarter numbers, and I think that sort of point out number one, for the analyst community to understand the numbers, and for our shareholders in general. If I look at that and say that it wasn't there, the $3.5 million wouldn't a 100% disappear, but between 80% and 85% of it would. And the balance that wouldn't disappear would be the additional dollars that would've been paid out in incentive compensation. And so that was felt by everybody within the organization in the fourth quarter.
One other item that I would mention and again, I feel compelled only from the standpoint of. For those of you that have owned our stock over the years, I'm happy I have the opportunity to directly meet with Bob Kerlin in the past, Will Oberton in the present. One thing you know about Fastenal is in our course of business, operating in a very ethical and force-right manner, and we're proud of that. And two items cited by the DOJ in their press release last week we take excess into. We believe over the course of the contract that we acted in good faith and we priced our product accordingly in terms of the contract. The second item they cite was that we know and we sold import product. That statement actually is true. In the contract, that was admissible because it was a walk-in contract, the hardware contract, where a customer would come in and buy product. And it was broken out in the contract but the buyer was responsible for determining country of origin. We did sell that product when the customer came in. We reported that in our reporting to the government, and we think that was appropriate in context to the contract. But we agreed to disagree, we settled it and now we move forward. And I'm glad it's behind us, so we can move forward in 2011.
The final item I'll touch on is on Page 11 and that relates to cash flow. Sorry, there isn't a call where I don't at least touch on cash flow sometime during the context of the conversation. Again, I'll frame it back when we started 'pathway to profit' back in 2007. In that meeting that we had with our shareholders, we talked about the 'pathway to profit' what we're hoping to accomplish from standpoint of profitability. We also touched on what we hope to accomplish from the standpoint of cash flow. 
In that discussion, we've said generally speaking, our target was to have operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings at least 85%. In 2010, we came in at 90.6%. We also talked about that spending somewhere in the 25% of earnings in the form of capital expenditures. So if you take the 85% back off to 25%, our goal would be to have approaching a 60% of our earnings available in free cash flow to use for other purposes that might be returning to our shareholders that might be other investing opportunities that come along.
In 2010, we've spent about 26% of our earnings in net cap of CapEx, leaving 64.5% of our earnings available as free cash flow. We paid out 68.9% of our earnings so we depleted our cash flow, but it has went through the year. But a very, very strong cash flow and I believe, again, that starts well as we enter into 2011.
With that, I will now turn it over for questions."

We have a broad base of business. The construction improving as we went through the year, a lot of non-Fastenal products including those sales as well that pull that mix down a little bit. I think what really drives our ability to manage as we go through that mix is the job our procurement group has done over time of building a nice offering of products. If you look through our catalog, great selection of products, great job of outsourcing. And we've done a nice job adding exclusive brands. And it still as a percentage of our sales is relative -- if you ignore the faster piece, it's still relatively small, but it's been building every year. And I think that puts us in position to maintain and improve that 52% as we move into the new year."

In 2010, our biggest initiatives were adding government sales reps, manufacturing sales reps and sales reps selling our vending systems. But none of those showed up in our sales investments and they're purely a sales investment. And even over and above those, the cost of keeping those people on the road. And so we really want to give the clearest picture that we can of what we're doing. And the reason we chose is to put a lot of investment into those areas is that it's the greatest way to lever our sales. Going into 2010, we weren't sure what the economy was going to bring us and the business was going to do. So we really look hard, and we said, we think we can get a better boost in our business by putting sales specialist above the store umbrella and driving business to the store than the entry level sales people doing it one small account at a time. They're both important. But if you only have so many people to add, we felt this was our best investment. And so we wanted to state that and the way you look at our sales investments in our releases."

There were small price increases coming through from the middle of the year. But for the most part, they were smaller categories, and we are putting up the iron and holding them back kind of doing the haise man [ph] on the price increases coming. But with oil prices going up, the plastic products and other products go up. So right now, we are seeing more price increases coming through. We're mitigating them as well as we can. And going into the year, the cost will go up some. We'll put inventory cycle, it's going to take -- that will be coming through more by the end of the first quarter going into the summer months on the non-fastener products. We're also are trying to push price increases sooner than that but it always takes time. On the fastener products, the steel has been, it's kind of been a roller coaster lately. The U.S. steel is way up. Asian steel has not risen as much. But our purchasing manager just got back from a week in Asia and everyone is selling and prices are going to be going up. One of the things that's really thrown at us now is the flooding in Australia because the coaking compound that they need for making steel comes from Australia. No one quite knows how that's going to effect things yet. We don't know if that's real or just a hype to push up steel. So we're going to be watching it very closely. We have a lot of people on the ground over there. And as soon as prices start going up, we're going to push up with them. If anything, we think it's a positive for our business going forward as long as it doesn't get too crazy. But pricing is really visible. So if I were have to guess, I would say we'd have above average inflation in 2011 from what we're seeing today. I do not predict that this time that it would look like 2008, but it's really too early to say that."

I was asking my folks just the end of last week when I was going through some of the data. I said, what's going on that could pull it up that way? A big chunk of our business and part of it is the way you look at the data, you measure the data, we use mix codes unless you would suspect. And included in our customer grouping is something that shows up the next code as a reseller. It's a little bit of a fuzzy category because some contractors spending on how that the next code of class so I could show up there as can a true reseller. That business grew quite nicely in the fourth quarter and in the month of December. And that pulled the overall piece up. And I believe, and I don't have that stuff right in front of me, that's between, it's just north of 15% of our sales and it grew well above the company number. My suspicion is some of those contractors like businesses, an electrician could easily show up as a reseller because they're an electrician, they have a small front room to their business. And even though they're really supporting construction, they're showing there. I think there's been some pickups in construction that maybe won't be necessarily apparent in all the published data."

And then as we got into 2010, that snapback nicely in the first six months and we're at or slightly above that level as we end the year, which again, puts us in a nice position for the new year. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece that we've talked about, when you look at when there is some inflation going on, when there is some fluidity to pricing. One of the things that people sometimes don't like about our business is the fact that our inventory turns about twice a year. Unfortunately, for us our gross margins make it provide for us to get a great return still on that inventory. In a period of deflating times, as we saw in 2009, that beats the heck out of us because you're selling higher price product on the shelf for quite a few months into a weakening marketplace. And in a marketplace, where our prices are going up, six months of inventory and maybe 10 or 11 months of import inventory place a little bit better. And it affords you the opportunity to see the pricing changes as they're happening to have a better plan for how you're going to react to that price increase or price change. And it allows you a three to seven-month window of some pricing flexibility."

In 2011, we're coming to the year, we say based on all these things, what's a reasonable range for growth? We think that's a reasonable range. If you look at that and say the economy is stronger or there's some inflation, we would hope that would be at range that we would be at the high-end of that bidding. If the economy were to take a dip down or deflation, which I'd surprised by but if those kind of things happened, it beats you up towards the lower end. But I can't cite for you the fact that we assume this kind of GDP growth. What I will say is we do pay attention to realize them. If we see an ISM [Institute for Supply Management] number that were all of a sudden change appreciatively that tend to lead our business by about three months.

While it's very weak on the Non-Res Construction would be anything to do with retail. Very little housing being built kind of the private sector business, non-energy private sectors is very slow. We don't see that coming back. When you look at the releases coming from the targets and the people like that, they're not planning on ramping up their store openings anytime soon or most of them are not. So we're going to work hard to put our sales energy into those types of projects that the healthcare energy things like that. If it were to come back stronger, if the economy picks up and people start bringing up the market books [ph], there's no question it would help our business because it's a big sector that's pretty soft. Margin is about a portion between manufacturing and big constructions, there wouldn't be much there. But it would really just hopefully push us up above the numbers that we're talking about. And I think that's basically Dan just said is that we got to boost from something like a sector or just the overall economy. We should see it moving up. Right now we're not over investing in construction, we're just looking at the big projects. The dollars today are pretty concentrated around the big projects like the energy field."

I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%.",1211,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. I probably report the numbers for the fourth quarter and for 2010. Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%. We didn't see a little bit of softness in November, but it bounced back nicely in December and actually had a strong month from start to finish. 
The positive things about our sales growth is that the growth is widespread. We're seeing good growth in almost all regions of the country, geographic areas. Our international businesses is doing very well. The business grew over 30% for the year, and we have a lot of good things going on in the international side. So we're very excited about that and about the good domestic growth.
As the company reported 44.8% pretax growth for 2010. And for the fourth quarter, we hit right at 50%. I'm very proud of those numbers. We've worked very hard at that. On the net earnings side, it was a little low because our tax rate was slightly higher for the year. We had 43.9% earnings growth for the year and 46.3% for the quarter, both solid numbers. 
A lot of the earnings growth was driven because of the nice job we did on expense control. Our SG&A for the year overall expenses for the year were up 8.5%. For the quarter, it went a little higher at 15.1%. Dan is going to touch a little bit on that as we go into the call. 
Some of the expenses that I was really excited about. On a non-payroll expense for the year was actually flat to down slightly. It was basically flat for the year. Really good job by the team working on everything we could do and working hard to control that.
With the payroll expense, we were only up 8.5% but that was driven by commissions and bonuses rebounding from our 2009 expenses. Other areas in the expense category that I think we did a very nice job on, the first would be distribution. Distribution expense is the closest expense we have related to the physical movement of product. You move more product, you move more weight, you spend more money. It's pretty straightforward. But our group worked really hard at implementing some new software, some new ideas, some better ways of doing business and it grew our business by 17%, and grew their expenses by less than 4% in the warehouse side of our business. And really proud of those numbers, so I left that at the end of the year and proud of the team that did that. 
On the transportation side, it's also a very physical part of our business, moving weight because as I've said many times. The products we sell is pretty inexpensive by the pound. We sell processed steel. Our transportation group did a nice job in an environment where they feel prices were rising and actually turned the profit for the company after you considered putting all the credits we received from suppliers for holding product fee, charges we charge the customers for delivering product, it netted out in our expenses. It netted out that we actually had a profit for the year. And I think, in the whole three of the last three quarters, we turned the profit in freight. So I know they're job well done by the people in the transportation department.
As far as hiring, we did hire about 700 sales people throughout the year. People within our stores. Going forward, we will continue to add people into our store and sales operations. And right now, what we're planning for is the ads people in the stores at about 60% to 70% the rate of our sales growth. So if you look at the fourth quarter, it's easy to do the math. We'll probably add 13% to 14% additional store people if we continue to grow at about the rate we're growing today. If we were to accelerate out of that, we would increase. And if we were to slowdown, we would bring that back trying to manage our expense. 
On the support personnel side, which makes up approximately 30% of our labor force today, we will add some people in 2011. We've been tight for the last few years. Our plan there is to add support personnel at half or less the rate of sales. So again, looking at where we are with the month-to-month releases, so it's pretty easy to figure out what our plan is.
Our store openings, we had a strong finish on the store openings that was really designed in the beginning of the year, trying to understand how the year was going to play out. The year played out well. So we increased our openings in the second half. Going forward, our plan for 2011 is to open between 149 and 200 stores, which is a 6% to 8% range. We may round that up to 150 to 200, it sounds better Dan. So we're optimistic and we're going to open stores. We believe it's one of the course to our growth strategy.
Switching to 'pathway to profit'. 'Pathway to profit' for those of who you that aren't familiar is our strategic growth plan that we laid out in 2007. And what I'd like to say is we're back on course for the 'pathway to profit'. With the profit improvements that we've identified through this slowdown over the last two years, found new ways of doing business, ways of saving money. We now believe that we're going to achieve the 23% pretax number with a lower average store size. If you recall, when we first laid this out, we had said we needed to achieve an average store size of 125,000 per store per month. 
Looking at our current release we just put out today, if you look at that data, it shows that we really need to be at about $100,000 to $110,000 per month looking at those numbers to achieve a 23% pretax rate, and we're comfortable that these numbers are sustainable going forward. If nothing else, we might be able to improve them slightly. Based on that, we should be able to achieve the $100,000 to $110,000 average store size in 2013, bringing the 'pathway to profit' timeline back a couple of years from what we have stated six to  nine months ago.
And so we are very excited about that. One of the great benefits of 'pathway to profit' is the return on the business that we get -- the return on invested capital assets equity. However, you look at it when the pretax moves up, the return gets moved up like it has a lever on it because there's a great advantage there. 
So before I close and hand it over to Dan, I just want to let you know that as an organization, we're starting out the year with a very high level of optimism and focus. And we're just really excited about going into the new year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. And then when he's done, we'll answer some questions.

And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.First off on is to reiterate about Will'",1693,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I just want to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.
First off on is to reiterate about Will's point. If you look at Page 1, one item I'd just like to highlight is as Will mentioned, November stoop a little bit in our trend, but December snapback nicely. And I'm pleased to say, when I look at our various group of stores and I look at our two-plus group, the fact that we were at 16.8% growth in that group in the final month of the year. It's a nice way to end the year and launch into the new year. So I'm pleased with the recovery in December and nice sales number for the entire quarter.
When I look into the document a little bit and I get into Pages 2 and 3, and we started looking at some of the sequential patterns that I started talking about a year ago on this call, and a little more detail to try to explain or treat for us to try to understand what was really happening as we went through the downturn and then the recovering of the model to our business. As you saw back in February, those little weather weakness, but other than that month, we are at or above trend at every month as we progress on our January, October pattern and prepare ourselves for 2011.
And continuing unto Page 4, that chart that lays out the patterns in our Manufacturing and Non-Res Construction business. Manufacturing, as we have talked about in 2009 have bottomed out earlier in the year and was performing quite well towards the tail end of '09 and then to 2010. If I look at the trend pattern at the bottom of Page 4, I'd see that the Non-Res Construction and I look at it in comparison to pre-slowdown. So I look at it in October 2008 timeframe. We've been slowly inching back as we go through the year back to that benchmark pattern from 2008. And I feel again, I believe that position us well going into the new year.
One other item I'd touched on is when I look at 2010 and in 2009, we have pulled back quite aggressively and our headcount have managed through the downturn, and we've saw some weakening in our active account growth as a result. When I look at Q4 2010, it's our strongest quarter for the year in active account growth. And again, I believe all those things lined up to bode well as we begin the new year.
Page 5, as Will mentioned on the 'pathway to profit', that table we have, 'pathway to profit' starts on Page 5. The table we have on Page 7, really touches on what Will was pointing out is that when we started the 'pathway to profit', our target $125,000 a month in average sales for our store group. We felt would yield a 23% operating margin, pretax margin for the company. With the improvements we've made on the operating expense side and this despite a weakening in our gross margin as we went through 2009. And saw some recovery in 2010, despite that, we're able to improve the relative profitability of the various groups such that we look at it now and say $100,000 to $110,000 is a reasonable range where we can hope to achieve the 23% operating margin. And what that does is it shortens up the amount of time that possible event push back by the recession. 
One other item I'd point out is for the benefit of the reader is on Page 6. We changed the display of how we show that table, and we now have broken out what we not only store personnel but non-store selling personnel. Because I think it's an important item to note the selling energy and reinvestments we're making into the selling energy both in 2010. And as we progress through and report our 2011 numbers, it just brings added clarity to where we're adding resources.
If I look at the support area and I ignore the distribution and manufacturing, I look at true administrative support, you would see that like we talked about back in 2007, as we slowdown the store openings and focus our energy on growing the stores, growing the headcount per store, growing the business per store, the amount of overhead, true overhead we have as an organization, really holds pretty constant because the individual business units are levering up. And you see that in our administrative personnel in that timeframe, which is essentially flat over the last three years.
Finally, operating and administrative expenses. As Will mentioned, we feel we've managed that well as we went through 2010. In the release on Page 9, we mentioned that some of the changes in the cost components. One item that I'd point out, I think it's useful for the reader to understand is that when we look at -- we've always indicated and you can read in our proxy, you can read it in a lot of our filings, we are a very entrepreneurial organization. We reward for growth. There's two sides to that coin in 2009, we saw it and a lot of it. Everybody within Fastenal had a tremendous belt-tightening, personally, as they went through 2009 as the incentive compensation dried up. 
In 2010 that expanded quite nicely. And if you look at our increase in payroll cost for 2010 and you quantify the pieces, about 75% of the increase in payroll costs in 2010 is solely related to incentive comp, commissions paid to personnel at our store, incentive bonuses paid to our district leadership, regional leadership, support infrastructure, distribution personal, administrative personnel, et cetera, all of those combined bonuses and then the final one on 41K match, all those pieces, the expansion of that resulted in 75% of our expense growth and payroll. The other 25% was related to the actual adding of people and working more hours throughout the year as our business grew.
One other item I feel compelled to mention. Just for clarity to our operating expenses as well. Last week, we've put out a press release indicating we had settled a dispute that we had with the Department of Justice, as related to our GSA hardware contract. And in our release last week, we indicated that we settled for $6.25 million. A $3.5 million of that settlement is recorded in our fourth quarter numbers. Approximately $2 million was recorded in our third quarter numbers, and I think that sort of point out number one, for the analyst community to understand the numbers, and for our shareholders in general. If I look at that and say that it wasn't there, the $3.5 million wouldn't a 100% disappear, but between 80% and 85% of it would. And the balance that wouldn't disappear would be the additional dollars that would've been paid out in incentive compensation. And so that was felt by everybody within the organization in the fourth quarter.
One other item that I would mention and again, I feel compelled only from the standpoint of. For those of you that have owned our stock over the years, I'm happy I have the opportunity to directly meet with Bob Kerlin in the past, Will Oberton in the present. One thing you know about Fastenal is in our course of business, operating in a very ethical and force-right manner, and we're proud of that. And two items cited by the DOJ in their press release last week we take excess into. We believe over the course of the contract that we acted in good faith and we priced our product accordingly in terms of the contract. The second item they cite was that we know and we sold import product. That statement actually is true. In the contract, that was admissible because it was a walk-in contract, the hardware contract, where a customer would come in and buy product. And it was broken out in the contract but the buyer was responsible for determining country of origin. We did sell that product when the customer came in. We reported that in our reporting to the government, and we think that was appropriate in context to the contract. But we agreed to disagree, we settled it and now we move forward. And I'm glad it's behind us, so we can move forward in 2011.
The final item I'll touch on is on Page 11 and that relates to cash flow. Sorry, there isn't a call where I don't at least touch on cash flow sometime during the context of the conversation. Again, I'll frame it back when we started 'pathway to profit' back in 2007. In that meeting that we had with our shareholders, we talked about the 'pathway to profit' what we're hoping to accomplish from standpoint of profitability. We also touched on what we hope to accomplish from the standpoint of cash flow. 
In that discussion, we've said generally speaking, our target was to have operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings at least 85%. In 2010, we came in at 90.6%. We also talked about that spending somewhere in the 25% of earnings in the form of capital expenditures. So if you take the 85% back off to 25%, our goal would be to have approaching a 60% of our earnings available in free cash flow to use for other purposes that might be returning to our shareholders that might be other investing opportunities that come along.
In 2010, we've spent about 26% of our earnings in net cap of CapEx, leaving 64.5% of our earnings available as free cash flow. We paid out 68.9% of our earnings so we depleted our cash flow, but it has went through the year. But a very, very strong cash flow and I believe, again, that starts well as we enter into 2011.
With that, I will now turn it over for questions.

We have a broad base of business. The construction improving as we went through the year, a lot of non-Fastenal products including those sales as well that pull that mix down a little bit. I think what really drives our ability to manage as we go through that mix is the job our procurement group has done over time of building a nice offering of products. If you look through our catalog, great selection of products, great job of outsourcing. And we've done a nice job adding exclusive brands. And it still as a percentage of our sales is relative -- if you ignore the faster piece, it's still relatively small, but it's been building every year. And I think that puts us in position to maintain and improve that 52% as we move into the new year.

In 2010, our biggest initiatives were adding government sales reps, manufacturing sales reps and sales reps selling our vending systems. But none of those showed up in our sales investments and they're purely a sales investment. And even over and above those, the cost of keeping those people on the road. And so we really want to give the clearest picture that we can of what we're doing. And the reason we chose is to put a lot of investment into those areas is that it's the greatest way to lever our sales. Going into 2010, we weren't sure what the economy was going to bring us and the business was going to do. So we really look hard, and we said, we think we can get a better boost in our business by putting sales specialist above the store umbrella and driving business to the store than the entry level sales people doing it one small account at a time. They're both important. But if you only have so many people to add, we felt this was our best investment. And so we wanted to state that and the way you look at our sales investments in our releases.

There were small price increases coming through from the middle of the year. But for the most part, they were smaller categories, and we are putting up the iron and holding them back kind of doing the haise man [ph] on the price increases coming. But with oil prices going up, the plastic products and other products go up. So right now, we are seeing more price increases coming through. We're mitigating them as well as we can. And going into the year, the cost will go up some. We'll put inventory cycle, it's going to take -- that will be coming through more by the end of the first quarter going into the summer months on the non-fastener products. We're also are trying to push price increases sooner than that but it always takes time. On the fastener products, the steel has been, it's kind of been a roller coaster lately. The U.S. steel is way up. Asian steel has not risen as much. But our purchasing manager just got back from a week in Asia and everyone is selling and prices are going to be going up. One of the things that's really thrown at us now is the flooding in Australia because the coaking compound that they need for making steel comes from Australia. No one quite knows how that's going to effect things yet. We don't know if that's real or just a hype to push up steel. So we're going to be watching it very closely. We have a lot of people on the ground over there. And as soon as prices start going up, we're going to push up with them. If anything, we think it's a positive for our business going forward as long as it doesn't get too crazy. But pricing is really visible. So if I were have to guess, I would say we'd have above average inflation in 2011 from what we're seeing today. I do not predict that this time that it would look like 2008, but it's really too early to say that.

When I look at 2011, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but just based on the trends of the last two years, we were north of 40 basis points, at least that was the number in 2009. We've had that down closer to the upper 30s. It'd be nice to keep wiggling that down as we move through 2011, with the eventual goal of getting that to low-30 basis points. But time will see how that plays out.

A big chunk of our business and part of it is the way you look at the data, you measure the data, we use mix codes unless you would suspect.

It's a little bit of a fuzzy category because some contractors spending on how that the next code of class so I could show up there as can a true reseller. That business grew quite nicely in the fourth quarter and in the month of December. And that pulled the overall piece up. And I believe, and I don't have that stuff right in front of me, that's between, it's just north of 15% of our sales and it grew well above the company number. My suspicion is some of those contractors like businesses, an electrician could easily show up as a reseller because they're an electrician, they have a small front room to their business. And even though they're really supporting construction, they're showing there. I think there's been some pickups in construction that maybe won't be necessarily apparent in all the published data.

And then as we got into 2010, that snapback nicely in the first six months and we're at or slightly above that level as we end the year, which again, puts us in a nice position for the new year. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece that we've talked about, when you look at when there is some inflation going on, when there is some fluidity to pricing. One of the things that people sometimes don't like about our business is the fact that our inventory turns about twice a year. Unfortunately, for us our gross margins make it provide for us to get a great return still on that inventory. In a period of deflating times, as we saw in 2009, that beats the heck out of us because you're selling higher price product on the shelf for quite a few months into a weakening marketplace. And in a marketplace, where our prices are going up, six months of inventory and maybe 10 or 11 months of import inventory place a little bit better. And it affords you the opportunity to see the pricing changes as they're happening to have a better plan for how you're going to react to that price increase or price change. And it allows you a three to seven-month window of some pricing flexibility.

We kind of look at all those pieces, and we say based on this, what do we think is a reasonable way to plan our business? And plan our business for the new year just as we did coming into 2010. In 2011, we're coming to the year, we say based on all these things, what's a reasonable range for growth? We think that's a reasonable range. If you look at that and say the economy is stronger or there's some inflation, we would hope that would be at range that we would be at the high-end of that bidding. If the economy were to take a dip down or deflation, which I'd surprised by but if those kind of things happened, it beats you up towards the lower end. But I can't cite for you the fact that we assume this kind of GDP growth. What I will say is we do pay attention to realize them. If we see an ISM [Institute for Supply Management] number that were all of a sudden change appreciatively that tend to lead our business by about three months. And so it will give us a little room to react as far as some of our expectations.

We don't see that coming back.

Margin is about a portion between manufacturing and big constructions, there wouldn't be much there. But it would really just hopefully push us up above the numbers that we're talking about. And I think that's basically Dan just said is that we got to boost from something like a sector or just the overall economy. We should see it moving up. Right now we're not over investing in construction, we're just looking at the big projects. The dollars today are pretty concentrated around the big projects like the energy field.

Starting out with sales growth, we grew our business by 17.6% for the entire year. For the quarter, we grew at 20.3%. We didn't see a little bit of softness in November, but it bounced back nicely in December and actually had a strong month from start to finish. 
The positive things about our sales growth is that the growth is widespread. We're seeing good growth in almost all regions of the country, geographic areas. Our international business is doing very well. The business grew over 30% for the year, and we have a lot of good things going on in the international side. So we're very excited about that and about the good domestic growth.
As the company reported 44.8% pretax growth for 2010 and for the fourth quarter, we hit right at 50%, I'm very proud of those numbers. We've worked very hard at that. On the net earnings side, it was a little lower because our tax rate was slightly higher for the year. We had 43.9% earnings growth for the year and 46.3% for the quarter, both solid numbers. 
A lot of the earnings growth was driven because of the nice job we did on expense control. Our SG&A for the year overall expenses for the year were up 8.5%. For the quarter, it went a little higher at 15.1%. Dan is going to touch a little bit on that as we go into the call. 
Some of the expense areas that I was really excited about. Our non-payroll expense for the year was actually flat to down slightly. It was basically flat for the year. Really good job by the team working on everything we could do and working hard to control that.
With the payroll expense, we were only up 8.5% but that was driven by commissions and bonuses rebounding from our 2009 expenses. Other areas in the expense category that I think we did a very nice job on. The first would be distribution. Distribution expense is the closest expense we have related to the physical movement of product. You move more product, you move more weight, you spend more money. It's pretty straightforward. But our group worked really hard at implementing some new software, some new ideas, some better ways of doing business and it grew our business by 17%, and grew their expenses by less than 4% in the warehouse side of our business. And I was really proud of those numbers, so I looked at them at the end of the year and proud of the team that did that. 
On the transportation side, it's also a very physical part of our business, moving weight because as I've said many times, the product we sell is pretty inexpensive by the pound. We sell processed steel. Our transportation group did a nice job in rising in an environment where they feel prices were rising and actually turned the profit for the company after you considered putting all the credits we received from suppliers for holding product fee, the charges we charge the customers for delivering product, it netted out and in our expenses  it netted out that we actually had a profit for the year. And I think, in the whole three of the last three quarters, we turned a profit in freight. So I know they're job well done by the people in the transportation department.
As far as hiring, we did hire about 700 sales people throughout the year, people within our stores. Going forward, we will continue to add people into our store and sales operations. And right now, what we're planning for is to ads people in the stores at about 60% to 70% the rate of our sales growth. So if you look at the fourth quarter, it's easy to do the math. We'll probably add 13% to 14% additional store people if we continue to grow at about the rate we're growing today. If we were to accelerate out of that, we would increase. And if we were to slow down, we would bring that back trying to manage our expense. 
On the support personnel side, which makes up approximately 30% of our labor force today, we will add some people in 2011. We've been tight for the last few years. Our plan there is to add support personnel at half or less the rate of sales. So again, looking at where we are with the month-to-month releases, it's pretty easy to figure out what our plan is.
Our store openings, we had a strong finish in the store openings that was really designed in the beginning of the year, trying to understand how the year was going to play out. The year played out well, so we increased our openings in the second half. Going forward, our plan for 2011 is to open between 149 and 200 stores, which is a 6% to 8% range. We may round that up to 150 to 200, it sounds better, Dan. So we're optimistic and we're going to open stores. We believe it's one of the cores to our growth strategy.
Switching to 'pathway to profit'. 'Pathway to profit' for those of who you that aren't familiar is our strategic growth plan that we laid out in 2007. And what I'd like to say is we're back on course for the 'pathway to profit'. With the profit improvements that we've identified through this slowdown over the last two years, found new ways of doing business, ways of saving money. We now believe that we're going to achieve the 23% pretax number with a lower average store size. If you recall, when we first laid this out, we had said we needed to achieve an average store size of 125,000 per store per month. 
Looking at our current release we just put out today, if you look at that data, it shows that we really need to be at about $100,000 to $110,000 per month looking at those numbers to achieve a 23% pretax rate, and we're comfortable that these numbers are sustainable going forward. If nothing else, we might be able to improve them slightly. Based on that, we should be able to achieve the $100,000 to $110,000 average store size in 2013, bringing the 'pathway to profit' timeline back a couple of years from what we have stated six to  nine months ago.
And so we are very excited about that. One of the great benefits of 'pathway to profit' is the return on the business that we get -- the return on invested capital assets equity. However, you look at it when the pretax moves up, the return gets moved up like it has a lever on it because there's a great advantage there. 
So before I close and hand it over to Dan, I just want to let you know that as an organization, we're starting out the year with a very high level of optimism and focus. And we're just really excited about going into the new year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. And then when he's done, we'll answer some questions."

And again, thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I’m just going to highlight a few points in the press release just for the convenience of the reader out there.
First off, on is to reiterate about Will's points. If you look at Page 1, one item I'd just like to highlight is as Will mentioned, the leverage slipped a little bit in our trend, but December snapped back nicely. And I'm pleased to say, when I look at our various groups of stores and I look at our two-plus group, the fact that we were at 16.8% growth in that group in the final month of the year. It's a nice way to end the year and launch into the new year. So I'm pleased with the recovery in December and nice sales number for the entire quarter.
When I look into the document a little bit and I get into Pages 2 and 3, and we start looking at some of the sequential patterns that I started talking about a year ago on this call, and in a little more detail to try to explain or  for us to try to understand what was really happening as we went through the downturn and then the recovering of the model to our business. As you saw back in February, there was a little weather weakness, but other than that month, we are at or above trend in every month as we progressed on our January, October pattern and prepare ourselves for 2011.
And continuing on to Page 4, that chart that lays out the patterns in our Manufacturing and Non-Res Construction business. Manufacturing, as we have talked about in 2009 had bottomed out earlier in the year and was performing quite well towards the tail end of '09 and then to 2010. If I look at the trend pattern at the bottom of Page 4, I'd see that the Non-Res Construction and I look at it in comparison to pre-slowdown. So I look at it in October 2008 timeframe. We've been slowly inching back as we go through the year back to that benchmark pattern from 2008. And I feel again, I believe that positions us well going into the new year.
One other item I'd touch on is when I look at 2010 and in 2009, we had pulled back quite aggressively in our headcounts to manage through the downturn, and we saw some weakening in our active account growth as a result. When I look at Q4 2010, it's our strongest quarter for the year in active account growth. And again, I believed all those things lined up to bode well as we begin the new year.
Page 5, as Will mentioned on the 'pathway to profit', that table we have, 'pathway to profit' starts on Page 5. The table we have on Page 7, really touches on what Will was pointing out is that when we started the 'pathway to profit', our target $125,000 a month in average sales for our store group we felt would yield a 23% operating margin, pretax margin for the company. With the improvements we've made on the operating expense side and this despite a weakening in our gross margin as we went through 2009 and saw some recovery in 2010. Despite that, we were able to improve the relative profitability of the various groups such that we look at it now and say $100,000 to $110,000 is a reasonable range where we can hope to achieve the 23% operating margin. And what that does is it shortens up the amount of time that possible event pushed back by the recession. 
One other item I'd point out is for the benefit of the reader is on Page 6. We changed the display of how we show that table, and we now have broken out what we not only store personnel but non-store selling personnel. Because I think it's an important item to note the selling energy and the investments we're making into the selling energy both in 2010. And as we progress through and report our 2011 numbers, it just brings added clarity to where we're adding resources.
If I look at the support area and I ignore the distribution and manufacturing, I look at true administrative support, you would see that like we talked about back in 2007, as we slowed down the store openings and focus our energy on growing the stores, growing the headcount per store, growing the business per store, the amount of overhead, true overhead we have as an organization, really holds pretty constant because the individual business units are levering up. And you see that in our administrative personnel in that timeframe, which is essentially flat over the last three years.
Finally, operating and administrative expenses. As Will mentioned, we feel we've managed that well as we went through 2010. In the release on Page 9, we mentioned some of the changes in the cost components. One item that I'd point out, I think it's useful for the reader to understand is that when we look at -- we've always indicated and you can read it in our proxy, you can read it in a lot of our filings, we are a very entrepreneurial organization. We reward for growth. There's two sides to that coin in 2009, we saw it and a lot of it. Everybody within Fastenal had a tremendous belt-tightening, personally, as they went through 2009 as the incentive compensation dried up. 
In 2010 that expanded quite nicely. And if you look at our increase in payroll cost for 2010 and you quantify the pieces, about 75% of the increase in payroll costs in 2010 is solely related to incentive comp, commissions paid to personnel at our store, incentive bonuses paid to our district leadership, regional leadership, support infrastructure, distribution personnel, administrative personnel, et cetera, all of those combined bonuses and then the final one on 401K match, all those pieces, the expansion of that resulted in 75% of our expense growth in  payroll. The other 25% was related to the actual adding of people and working more hours throughout the year as our business grew.
One other item I feel compelled to mention. Just for clarity to our operating expenses as well. Last week, we put out a press release indicating we had settled a dispute that we had with the Department of Justice, which is related to our GSA hardware contract. And in our release last week, we indicated that we settled for $6.25 million. $3.5 million of that settlement is recorded in our fourth quarter numbers. Approximately $2 million was recorded in our third quarter numbers, and I think that sort of points out number one, for the analyst community to understand the numbers, and for our shareholders in general. If I looked at that and say that it wasn't there, the $3.5 million wouldn't a 100% disappear, but between 80% and 85% of it would. And the balance that wouldn't disappear would be the additional dollars that would've been paid out in incentive compensation. And so that was felt by everybody within the organization in the fourth quarter.
One other item that I would mention and again, I feel compelled only from the standpoint of for those of you that have owned our stock over the years, I'm happy I have the opportunity to directly meet with Bob Kerlin in the past, Will Oberton in the present. One thing you know about Fastenal is in our course of business, operating in a very ethical and forthright manner, and we're proud of that. And two items cited by the DOJ in their press release last week we take exception to. We believe over the course of the contract that we acted in good faith and we priced our product accordingly in terms of the contract. The second item they cite was that we know and we sold import product. That statement actually is true. In the contract, that was admissible because it was a walk-in contract, the hardware contract, where a customer would come in and buy product. And it was broken out in the contract but the buyer was responsible for determining country of origin. We did sell that product when the customer came in. We reported that in our reporting to the government, and we think that was appropriate in context to the contract. But we agreed to disagree, we settled it and now we move forward. And I'm glad it's behind us, so we can move forward in 2011.
The final item I'll touch on is on Page 11 and that relates to cash flow. Sorry, there isn't a call where I don't at least touch on cash flow sometime during the context of the conversation. Again, I'll frame it back when we started 'pathway to profit' back in 2007. In that meeting that we had with our shareholders, we talked about the 'pathway to profit' what we're hoping to accomplish from standpoint of profitability. We also touched on what we hope to accomplish from the standpoint of cash flow. 
In that discussion, we've said generally speaking, our target was to have operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings at around at least 85%. In 2010, we came in at 90.6%. We also talked about that spending somewhere in the 25% of earnings in the form of capital expenditures. So if you take the 85% back off the 25%, our goal would be to have approaching a 60% of our earnings available in free cash flow to use for other purposes that might be returning to our shareholders that might be other investing opportunities that come along.
In 2010, we spent about 26% of our earnings in net cap of CapEx, leaving 64.5% of our earnings available as free cash flow. We paid out 68.9% of our earnings so we depleted our cash flow, but it has lived through the year. But a very, very strong cash flow and I believe, again, that’s up well as we enter into 2011.
With that, I will now turn it over for questions."

I think what really drives our ability to manage as we go through that mix is the job our procurement group has done over time of building a nice offering of products. If you look through our catalog, great selection of products, great job of sourcing. And we've done a nice job adding exclusive brands. And it still as a percentage of our sales is relative -- if you ignore the fastener piece, it's still relatively small, but it's been building every year.

In 2010, our biggest initiatives were adding government sales reps, manufacturing sales reps and sales reps selling our vending systems.

And so we really want to give the clearest picture we can of what we're doing. And the reason we chose is to put a lot of investment into those areas is that it's the greatest way to lever our sales. Going into 2010, we weren't sure what the economy was going to bring us and the business was going to do. So we really looked hard, and we said, we think we can get a better boost in our business by putting sales specialists above the store umbrella and driving business to the store than the entry level sales people doing it one small account at a time. They're both important. But if you only have so many people to add, we felt this was our best investment.

There were small price increases coming through from the middle of the year. But for the most part, they were smaller categories, and we are putting up the arm and holding them back kind of doing the Heissman on the price increases coming. But with oil prices going up, the plastic products and other products go up. So right now, we are seeing more price increases coming through. We're mitigating them as well as we can. And going into the year, the cost will go up some. With the inventory cycle, it's going to take -- that will be coming through more by the end of the first quarter going into the summer months on the non-fastener products. We’ll start trying to push price increases sooner than that but it always takes time. On the fastener products, the steel has been, it's kind of been a roller coaster lately. The U.S. steel is way up. Asian steel has not risen as much. But our purchasing manager just got back from a week in Asia and everyone is selling and prices are going to be going up. One of the things that's really thrown it off now is the flooding in Australia because the coking compound that they need for making steel comes from Australia. No one quite knows how that's going to affect things yet. We don't know if that's real or just a hype to push up steel. So we're going to be watching it very closely. We have a lot of people on the ground over there. And as soon as prices start going up, we're going to push up with them. If anything, we think it's a positive for our business going forward as long as it doesn't get too crazy. But pricing is real visible. So if I had to guess, I would say we'd have above average inflation in 2011 from what we're seeing today. I do not predict at this time that it would look like 2008, but it's really too early to say that."

I was asking my folks just the end of last week when I was going through some of the data. I said, what's going on that could pull it up that way? A big chunk of our business and part of it is the way you look at the data, you measure the data, we use mix codes as you would suspect. And included in our customer grouping is something that shows us the next code as a reseller. It's a little bit of a fuzzy category because some contractors spending on how that the next code of class so I could show up there as can a true reseller. That business grew quite nicely in the fourth quarter and in the month of December. And that pulled the overall piece up. And I believe, and I don't have that stuff right in front of me, that's between, it's just north of 15% of our sales and it grew well above the company number. My suspicion is some of those contractor like businesses, an electrician could easily show up as a reseller because they're an electrician, they have a small front room to their business. And even though they're really supporting construction, they're showing there. I think there's been some pickups in construction that maybe won't be necessarily apparent in all the published data."

And what you saw as we went through 2009, that kept getting whittled away. And then as we got into 2010, that snapped back nicely in the first six months and we're at or slightly above that level as we end the year, which again, puts us in a nice position for the new year. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece that we've talked about, when you look at when there is some inflation going on, when there is some fluidity to pricing. One of the things that people sometimes don't like about our business is the fact that our inventory turns about twice a year. Fortunately, for us our gross margins make it provide for us to get a great return still on that inventory. In a period of deflating times, as we saw in 2009, that beats the heck out of us because you're selling higher priced product on the shelf for quite a few months into a weakening marketplace. And in a marketplace, where our prices are going up, six months of inventory and maybe 10 or 11 months of import inventory plays out a little better. In that it affords you the opportunity to see the pricing changes as they're happening to have a better plan for how you're going to react to that price increase or price change. And it allows you a three to seven-month window of some pricing flexibility."

We also understand the store openings, the growth plans we have as far as adding sales people both store based and non-store based. We kind of look at all those pieces, and we say based on this, what do we think is a reasonable way to plan our business? And plan our business for the new year just as we did coming into 2010. In 2011, we're coming to the year, we say based on all these things, what's a reasonable range for growth? We think that's a reasonable range. If you look at that and say the economy is stronger or there's some inflation, we would hope that would be a range that we would be at the high-end of that bidding. If the economy were to take a dip down or deflation, which I'd surprised by but if those kind of things happened, it beats you up towards the lower end. But I can't cite for you the fact that we assume this kind of GDP growth. What I will say is we do pay attention to the ISM. If we see an ISM [Institute for Supply Management] number that were all of a sudden change appreciatively that tends to lead our business by about three months.

While it's very weak on the Non-Res Construction would be anything to do with retail. Very little housing being built kind of the private sector business, non-energy private sectors is very slow. We don't see that coming back. When you look at the releases coming from the targets and the people like that, they're not planning on ramping up their store openings any time soon or most of them are not. So we're going to work hard to put our sales energy into those types of projects that the healthcare energy things like that. If it were to come back stronger, if the economy picks up and people start bringing up the pocketbooks, there's no question it would help our business because it's a big sector that's pretty soft. Margin is about a portion between manufacturing and big constructions, there wouldn't be much there. But it would really just hopefully push us up above the numbers that we're talking about. And I think that's basically Dan just said is that we got a boost from something like a sector or just the overall economy. We should see it moving up. Right now we're not over investing in construction, we're just looking at the big projects. The dollars today are pretty concentrated around the big projects like the energy field."

Very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped an extra day, but we'll take it. The exciting thing th",1051,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped an extra day, but we'll take it. The exciting thing that makes us very optimistic about going into the year is our strong sequential trend. The way the quarter played out we had a good January, and then it went a little bit soft in February. We believe it was due to weather, but then we came back very strong in March. Where our March daily average was 7% higher than our February daily average, much above our normal sequential trends. 
For the January to March trend, more historically, we would be up 6.2%. But this year, we're up 8.6%. So moving forward in a nice pace, and we're excited by the progress that we've made.
I feel good about our progress on the gross margin. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points over the first quarter of last year. It was even with the fourth quarter, but a lot of that is geography, and Dan's going to give a better report on that. But we're making nice progress working on our margin, and we're well within our 51% to 53% range that we talked about or late right into the middle of that. 
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A grew at 16.7%, and I believe they did a really good job on that. Labor was up when you put in all the health cost and other things about 26% well above sales growth. But it's really being driven by the rebound of our bonuses, which we're very happy that's happening. Bonuses were up more than 100% year-over-year. So we're going to spend money that's the place just ended. 
The other expenses once you take labor out are actually flat to slightly down year-over-year, and that's just due to a strong focus on all the details. We learned a lot in the 2009 recession about where we needed to spend money and where we shouldn't be spending money, and it's coming through in the quarterly results in 2011.
From a pretax profit standpoint, we reported 20.1%. The first time that we've been over 20% in the first quarter for well over a decade. So we're proud of that. And it really puts us on a good track for our 'pathway to profit' progress that we talked about in the fourth quarter of being over 20%. So we're really moving towards the goals that we need to hit.
From a future standpoint, what we're looking for going forward start with a little history on that. At the beginning of 2010, really the end of 2009, the beginning of 2010, we were really working hard to determine where we should invest in growth drivers outside of our normal new store openings and the decisions we made were to add additional sales people at a higher level national accounts, government sales, automated supplier, vending and some product specialists, which we did.
So looking at those groups, our International Accounts business we over invested in that group is growing very nicely. We have a lot of activity with the large customers. We've seen tremendous success with our government sales efforts. At the beginning of 2010, we put in a Vice President of Government Sales. We restructured how we approach that business because we haven't done what we felt to be a very good job at chasing that business or trying to go out and get that business. 
John and his team, new government sales rep, were very active in the last year trying to understand the business. And at the end of 2010, we signed a contract with the CPCN, which is a purchasing network that represent state buyers. The beginning of this year, we signed a contract with Wisco, which is the Western States Cooperative Alliance, which is also a large purchasing alliance that represent state and political subgroups. Basically, they negotiate deals for states and then states can opt in to bids. That business is not going to include because we're working on all the details when we think it has a lot potential for the future. Some of our large competitors have done a very nice job with that. So we're very optimistic with what we're doing with government sales going forward.
And what it really does, if you think about it, it's just expands the local market for our store because without these agreements we really don't have the ability to sell to these local entities with the agreement, it expands the market for the local store. Another area that we're optimistic about going into the future is our Fastenal automated supply technology, otherwise known as vending. We've been investing in that program for about the last two to two and a half years. We really started at the beginning of 2009. We're seeing very nice progress. We're seeing good adoption from our customers, and our plan is to continue to invest in the automated supply and continue to roll that out to our customers. 
The other growth driver and probably the most important growth driver that we have is higher-end quality people. What we see going into the rest of the year or the remainder of the year is we'll continue to hire sales people in the store and around the store at a rate of about 60% to 70% of sales growth. So if we were able to grow our sales at 20%, we would put in 13%, 12% to 14% new head count into the stores, and then we'll continue to hire support people at a lower rate but at rates sufficient to support the sales growth, and that we really see most of those people will be in distribution and manufacturing roles because that's really where we need the people to drive and support the sales going forward.
So although this is a brief report, I'm very happy with the quarter. I'd like to congratulate the Fastenal people are that are on here today and thank them for the effort that they put and with that, I'll turn over to Dan to report and give us a more in-depth report."

Today a pleasure I will be very brief. Some of the highlights I'd note from our earnings release again, on Pages 1 and 2 we highlight year-over-year growth patterns in our stores and in subset of our stores two plus, five plus and I'm happy to report that the two and five year-old plus stores, they saw nice gains in the second half of 2010 as their growth was taking off, and we're seeing that continue in the first three months of 2011.
From a sequential sales pattern, as Will said, from January to March, despite the weather impact in February, we've seen sequential gains that are well above our expected and track March was about 2.4%, sequentially better than history would tell us that should be and that bodes well if we go into the second and third quarters. The information you hear out of ISM also bodes well as I look forward into the second and third quarters. From an end market perspective, manufacturing continues to hold strong. We are seeing a pickup in momentum in our construction end markets, which is one piece of our business that was writing levels of 2010 and seeing very nice sequential gains from that business.
'pathway to profit' Will mentioned some of the investments we've been making on the people side. A few things that I'd point out if I look at the store FTE, which is up about 12% from a year ago, since we started the 'pathway to profit,' our store FTE is up about almost 23%. Our non-store and selling personnel the three areas that Will mentioned, as well as the investment and manufacturing sales personnel is up 27% from where it was at the start of 2007. So a lot of additional selling energy embedded in our organization, not only over the last 12 months but over the last four years. 
If you look at DC and Manufacturing, our previous peak month was September 2008 and that's where our head count and distribution Manufacturing have peaked right now we actually above 8.5% below that. A lot of that from the efficiencies that we've gained in our investments in distribution over the last four to five years. If I would remove the Holo-Krome acquisition of late 2009, our Manufacturing distribution head count is actually down about 12.5% from the peak in the fall 2008 and again, largely credited to the efficiency gains that we've incorporated in distribution systems over the last several years.
One of the things that we highlighted when we started the 'pathway to profit' was the efficiency we've also seen in our support personnel because of the overhead associated with opening stores more than growing sales and if I look at our support FTE, we're actually flat down slightly, in fact, from where we were in the first quarter of 2007 the last quarter before 'pathway to profit'. When we look at gross profit margin as Will touched on, we're only in our long term range of 51% to 53%, a range that we think allows for efficient growth of our business and serves well on our 'pathway to profit' initiative. 
If I look at the components of our gross margin on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis, our transactional margin improved so it improved both from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 2010 to Q1 2011. Our organizational gross profit was really our buying scale that improved from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 to Q1. So we have nice momentum in the components that make up our gross margin. 
The third piece when we look at the vendor allowances, everything from rebate programs to the way we move product, et cetera, on a year-over-year basis that's up nicely. On a Q4 to Q1 basis, Q1 is more than normalized number. Q4 was actually higher than normal because of some rebate programs coming in stronger than expected late last year. So despite about a 30 basis point drop in that from Q4 to Q1, again, now we're back to a more normalized number. We were able to mention our gross margins in the 30 basis point improvement all came from the first two categories I mentioned.
As Will touched on, our payroll and health care, our people costs included in SG&A increased about 27% from a year ago. If you look at all the remaining expenses within SG&A, they're actually flat with a year ago and that's our overall increase of about 17%. If I peel back that the onion a little bit, there's a few things in there that we're working against us. One is an distribution organization we spent a fair amount of energy, both at our store locations and within our vehicles suite. If you look at some of the information we put into the earnings release, our diesel fuel is up about 25% from first quarter to first quarter. That's a per gallon cost. Our gasoline is up about 20% per gallon cost. All I can say to those two stats because that rate our fuel dollar spent by about 34% when you combine that with the growth in our business. 
If you look at occupancy, we did a nice job on that. We had some increase due to go energy costs that I just mentioned the new Holo-Krome facility in Connecticut that we moved into and increases in real estate taxes. But if I look at the actual dollars that we paid out, they were up about 2.5% from first quarter of 2010.
Lastly, on the balance sheet side, on the working capital case, I think we did a nice job managing both our accounts receivable growth and inventory growth when you factor in the added sales March to March. When I look at cash flow as a percentage of earnings, our operating cash came in at 93.4%, typically first quarter a seasonally high. Our stated range for that is 80% to 90% on an annualized basis. We were able to announce for the first time in our history a dividend for the second quarter. We announced a $0.26 dividend last night, and we also announced the intention of our board to migrate from a semiannual dividend payment frequency to quarterly payment frequency, and this is the first I mentioned that.
The final thing I'll touch on, and this is just a little tidbit for today. One thing that jumped out of me as I was looking at not only the quarter but also the month of March and some activity in our stock price recently, this quarter it appeared to be the quarter of sense for us. It was the first time in our history market capitalization snapped above $10 billion. And congratulations to all the Fastenal employees and shareholders on the call. Second, our International business is now 10.3% of sales. That's what it came out to in the first quarter, so we've made a nice transition over the last decade from primarily a U.S. North American business, but primarily a U.S. to truly an international distribution business. And then the final piece is if you noticed in our monthly sales release, our daily average for the month of March was $10,501,000 per day. That is the first month since September of 2008 where our daily average is over $10 million a day. And so it's nice to have the finally, the shadow of the meltdown of late '08, early '09 behind us as we move into the rest of the year. 
With that, Will and I our open to questions. Thank you."

We plan to push prices up as soon as we can and hopefully capture incremental margin. But we're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation. If you look at the Asian steel and actually CRU if you look at the April, May price per ton and you look at the December price per ton steel was very flat throughout 2010. It has gone up in the first three months of this year. We have to understand on the fasteners side of our business, it's a long cycle. The product we buy say, in October of 2010 we'll be selling in June to October of 2011. We have about six to seven months worth of inventory, and it takes three to four months to get the products so that's a very long cycle. So we have not seen a lot of inflation in either the fasteners, which should be a little bit more than non-fastener business but we do anticipate a little bit of inflation coming through and we hear that from our suppliers. One of the reasons we believe we've not seen more inflation in the fasteners is the mainly Taiwanese but some Chinese factories we're buying from our running at about anywhere between 75% to 85% capacity and they're reluctant to push real hard on pricing because volume is a game for them. Our purchasing number was just over there in Asia about two or three weeks ago in fact, was with them and that's what we saw when we were there."

But it's a little bit of a longer cycle, and one of the things that happened in the fastener industry is heads and treads, which is the largest metal person. They were a large distributor from Asia and sold to distributors. They went out of business and it's kind of some of the market a little bit right now we're not sure where it's going. Again, we do anticipate fasteners going up. We're seeing increases as we speak. But we have to push those through to the customers. One big difference between now and 2007 and '08 is in 2007 and '08, the angle is very clear. We sharp, it was moving up. If you look at steel over the last year and a half, it's been rolling. It's generally rolling up, but it's going up and going down. It's a little bit harder to peg."

Those two mix shifts have been holding our margin and quite frankly, for the last 15, 16 months. And it still holds it somewhat in check. The wildcard is as Will just touched on some of the inflation and how that plays out as we go into the year. We think there is a potential for some upside and as we cycle through our inventory that's on the shelf and the stuff we ordered last fall. But at the end of the day, you have to take a step back and appreciate the way we go to market and the way we price our product. We have 2,500 locations out there. We influence those locations, don't get me wrong, by periodic adjustments to our wholesale prices, pushing the group of stores, group of districts that maybe are performing on the bottom half of the group there pushing them to rise to the performance of the remaining group. But at the end of the day, our pricing from day-to-day and from week to week is dictated by those 2,500 store managers and their support group and their local marketplace. And their compensation programs as we've always touched on and that's why we always cite that 51% to 53% range?

And part of it is because you're insuring more people part of it because the population is typically a little bit older, and whereas 20-year-old don't incur a lot of health care.

What I can tell you is we're seeing is improvement in the trends, and it's not geographically limited. It's pretty well diverse across the continent, and so it's just you're seeing a pickup in activity. And like we saw when the markets really opened down, that was the last one to slow down because the projects once they're funded, we don't stop a building when 10-story building you have two stories left. But you might not start a new one or you might not start a new road project or a bridge. But when the energy starts going into getting that again there's a latency because there's funding constraints, there is permitting constraints there's construction constraint. But once it starts being lift, you see nice improvement and they tend to be sustainable improvements and what we're seeing right now but it's well split across the country. As far as store openings, the 37 was a nice start to the year. The 150 to 200 we talked about. When I look at second quarter, we have a big customer show coming up in May, and so you will see some slippage in the openings probably in April and May because of that because one of our new stores ship out of that facility. We're trying to work around it just possible. Pre-prepping is the correct verb, some of the material so we can maintain our store openings. But there's no confident about our 150 to 200 range for the year. As far as the closings, over the last several years, you've seen some closings. It typically be a case of people doing a nice job every day of assessing their investments, their locations and where to best investment dollars need to be. In some markets where we see very depressed situations, we've actually consolidated some of our stores and part of that was on the managing of occupancy side. You had a market we can easily service instead of adding three locations we could easily service and market at of two you had to lease coming due and you could combine those stores, and I think that's always a good move and something that's we're comfortable to do every year. That said when I look at those markets, I still believe those markets will support additional stores in the future. I don't think this is a statement about any given markets or stores. It's really a statement about being prudent in a time that still is a weakened financial period and our districts and regional leadership are making our decisions everyday."

Two years ago, we contracted it quite dramatically as a reaction to the economic slowdown. But what we're really focusing on energy on everyday is obviously, management being smart about it. Buying a little bit of extra product last fall or even in the first quarter of this year before some potential inflation I think so it's a good move as long as you don't get carried away with it, and then we working everyday to better position where and inventory is does this belong is it better for this group of products to be in a store or in a distribution center to support our customers and their needs.

I'm very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped by an extra day, but we'll take it. The really exciti",1073,"Thank you, Ellen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped by an extra day, but we'll take it. The really exciting thing or the thing that makes us very optimistic about going into the year is our strong sequential trend, the way the quarter played out. We had a good January, and then it went a little bit soft in February. We believe it was due to weather, but then, we came back very strong in March, where our March daily average was 7% higher than our February daily average, much above our normal sequential trend. 
For the January to March trends, more historically, we would be up 6.2%. But this year, we're up 8.6%. So moving forward in a nice pace, and we're excited by the progress that we've made.
I feel good about our progress on the gross margin. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points over the first quarter of last year. It was even with the fourth quarter, but a lot of that is geography, and Dan's going to give a better report on that. But we're making nice progress working on our margin, and we're well within our 51% to 53% range that we talk about right in the middle of that. 
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A grew at 16.7%. And that's, I believe, they did a really good job or group did a really good job on that. Labor was up when you put in all the health costs and all the other things, about 26% well above sales growth. But it's really being driven by the rebound of our bonuses, which we're very happy that, that's happening. Bonuses were up more than 100% year-over-year. So if we're going to spend money, that's the place to spend it. 
The other expenses, once you take the labor out, were actually flat to slightly down year-over-year, and that's just due to a strong focus on all the details. We learned a lot in the 2009 recession about where we needed to spend money and where we shouldn't be spending money, and it's coming through in the quarterly results in 2011.
From a pretax profit standpoint, we reported 20.1%. The first time that we've been over 20% in the first quarter for well over a decade. So we're proud of that. And it really puts us on a good track for our 'pathway to profit' progress that we talked about in the fourth quarter of being over 20%. So we're really moving towards the goals that we need to hit.
From a future standpoint, what we're looking for going forward, I'll start with a little history on that. At the beginning of 2010 -- really, the end of 2009, the beginning of 2010, we were really working hard to determine where we should invest in growth drivers outside of our normal new store openings. And the decisions we made were to add additional sales people at a higher level National Accounts, government sales, Automated Supply or vending and some product specialists, which we did.
So looking at those groups, our National Accounts business, we over invested in that group, was drawing very nicely. We have a lot of activity with the large customers. We've seen tremendous success with our government sales efforts. At the beginning of 2010, we've put in a Vice President of Government Sales. We restructured how we approach that business because we hadn't done is what we thought to be a very good job at chasing that business or trying to go out and get that business. 
John and his team, that new government sales rep, were very active in the last year, trying to understand the business. And at the end of 2010, we signed a contract with the TPCN, which is a purchasing network that represents state buyers. The beginning of this year, we signed a contract with WSCA, which is a Western States Cooperative Alliance, which is also a large purchasing alliance that's represent state and political subgroups. Basically, they negotiate deals for states and then states can opt-in with the bids. That business is not coming through yet because we're working on all the details. 
We think it has a lot potential for the future. Our large competitors have done a very nice job with that. So we're very optimistic with what we're doing with government sales going forward. And what it really does, if you think about it, it just expands the local market for a store because without these agreements, we really don't have the ability to sell to these local entities. With the agreement, it expands the market for the local store. 
Another area that we're optimistic about going into the future is our Fastenal Automated Supply Technology, otherwise known as vending. We've been investing in that program for about the last two to two and a half years. We really started at the beginning of 2009. We're seeing very nice progress. We're seeing good adoption from our customers, and our plan is to continue to invest in the automated supply and continue to roll that out to our customers. 
The other growth driver and probably the most important growth driver that we have is hiring quality people. What we foresee going into the rest of the year or the remainder of the year is, we'll continue to hire sales people, sales in the store and around the store at a rate of about 60% to 70% of sales growth. So that if we're able to grow our sales at 20%, we would put in 12% to 14% new head count into the stores. And then we will continue to hire support people at a lower rate but at a rate sufficient to support the sales growth, and that we had really seen most of those people would in distribution and manufacturing roles because that's really where we need the people to drive and support the sales going forward.
So although this is a brief report, I'm very happy with the quarter. I'd like to congratulate the Fastenal people that are on here today, and thank them for the effort that they put forth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to report and give us a more in-depth report."

And again, thank you for participating in our call. Today, much to everybody's pleasure, I will be very brief. Some of the highlights I'd note from our earnings release, again, on Pages 1 and 2, we highlight year-over-year growth patterns in our stores and in a subset of our stores, our two plus and our five plus. And I'm happy to report that the two and five year-old plus stores, they saw nice gains in the second half of 2010 as their growth was taking off. And we're seeing that continue in the first three months of 2011.
From a sequential sales pattern, as Will said, from January to March, despite the weather impacts in February, we've seen sequential gains that are well above our expected. In fact, March was about 2.4%, sequentially better than history would tell us it should be. And that bodes well if we go into the second and third quarters. And the information you hear out of ISM also bodes well as I look forward into the second and third quarters. From an end market perspective, manufacturing continues to hold strong. We are seeing a pickup in momentum in our construction end markets, which is one piece of our business that was lagging as we went through 2010 and seeing very nice sequential gain from that business.
'Pathway to profit', Will mentioned some of the investments we've been making on the people side. A few things that I'd point out. If I look at the store FTE, which is up about 12% from a year ago, since we started the 'pathway to profit', our store FTE is up about almost 23%. Our non-store selling personnel, the three areas that Will mentioned, as well as the investments and manufacturing sales personnel, is up 27% from where it was at the start of 2007. So a lot of additional selling energy embedded in our organization, not only over the last 12 months but over the last four years. 
If you look at DC and Manufacturing, our previous peak month was September 2008, and that's where our head count and distribution manufacturing had peaked. Right now, we're actually about 8.5% below that. A lot of that from the efficiencies we've gained in our investments in distribution over the last four to five years. If I would remove the Holo-Krome acquisition of late 2009, our manufacturing distribution head count is actually down about 12.5% from the peak in the fall 2008. And, again, largely credited to the efficiency gains that we've incorporated into our distribution systems over the last several years.
One of the things that we highlighted when we started the 'pathway to profit' was the efficiency we'd also seen in our support personnel because of the overhead that's associated with opening stores more than growing sales. And if I look at our support FTE, we're actually flat, down slightly, in fact, from where we were in the first quarter of 2007, the last quarter before the 'pathway to profit'. When we look at gross profit margin, as Will touched on, we're soundly in the middle of our long-term stated range of 51% to 53%, a range that we think allows for good, efficient growth of our business and serve us well on our 'pathway to profit' initiative. 
If I look at the components of our gross margin on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis, our transactional margin improves. So it improved both from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 2010 to Q1 2011. Our organizational gross profit, which is really our buying scale, that improved from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 to Q1. So we have nice momentum in the components that make up our gross margin. 
The third piece, when we look at the vendor allowances, everything from rebate programs to the way we move product with freight, et cetera, on a year-over-year basis, that's up nicely. On a Q4-to-Q1 basis, Q1 is more than normalized number. Q4 was actually a little bit higher than normal because of some rebate programs coming in stronger than we expected in late last year. So despite about a 30 basis point drop in that from Q4 to Q1, again, now we're back to a more normalized number. We were able to maintain our gross margins and that 30 basis point improvement all came from the first two categories I mentioned.
As Will touched on, our payroll and health care, our people cost included in SG&A, increased about 27% from a year ago. If you look at all the remaining expenses within SG&A, they're actually flat with the year ago, and that's our overall increase of about 17%. If I peel back that onion a little bit, there's a few things in there that were working against us. One is, as a distribution organization, we spent a fair amount on energy, both at our store locations and within our vehicles suite. If you look at some of the information we put into the earnings release, our diesel fuel is up about 25% from first quarter to first quarter. That's a per gallon cost. Our gasoline is up about 20% at a per gallon cost. All I can say that those two stats is ouch because that raised our fuel dollar spend by about 34% when you combine that with the growth in our business. 
If you look at occupancy, we did a nice job on that. We had some increases due to both energy costs that I've just mentioned, the new Holo-Krome facility in Connecticut that we moved into and increases in real estate taxes. But if I look at the actual rent dollars that we paid out, they were up about 2.5% from first quarter 2010.
Lastly, on the balance sheet side, on the working capital piece, I think you did a nice job managing both our accounts receivable growth and inventory growth when you factor in the added sales March to March. When I look at cash flow as a percentage of earnings, our operating cash came in at 93.4%. Typically, first quarter is seasonally high. Our stated range for that is 80% to 90% on annualized basis. We were able to announce for the first time in our history, a dividend for the second quarter. We announced a $0.26 dividend last night. And we also announced the intention of our board to migrate from a semi-annual dividend payment frequency to a quarterly payment frequency, and this is the first evidence of that.
The final thing I'll touch on, and this is just a little tidbit for the day. One thing that jumped out of me as I was looking at not only the quarter, but also the month of March and some activity in our stock price recently, this quarter appeared to be the quarter of tens for us. Now it's the first time in our history, our market capitalization snapped above $10 billion. And congratulations to all the Fastenal employees and shareholders on the call. 
Second, our International business is now 10.3% of sales. That's what it came out to in the first quarter. So we've made a nice transition over the last decade from primarily a North American business, but primarily a U.S. to truly an International Distribution business. 
And then the final piece is, if you noticed in our monthly sales release, our daily average for the month of March was $10,501,000 per day. That is the first month since September of 2008, where our daily average is over $10 million a day. And so it's nice to have the, finally, the shadow of the meltdown of late '08, early '09 behind us as we move into the rest of the year. 
With that, Will and I are open to questions. Thank you."

We plan to push prices up as soon as we can and hopefully capture incremental margin. But we're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation. If you look at the Asian steel and actually CRU, if you look at the April, May price per ton and you look at the December price per ton, steel was very flat throughout 2010. It has gone up in the first three months of this year. We have to understand, on the fasteners side of our business, it's a long cycle. The product we buy, say in October of 2010, we'll be selling in June to October of 2011. We have about six to seven months worth of inventory, and it takes three to four months to get the products. So it's a very long cycle. So we have not seen a lot of inflation in either the fasteners. We've seen a little bit more in the non-fastener business, but we do anticipate inflation coming through, and we're hearing that from our suppliers. One of the reasons, we believe, we've not seen more inflation on the fasteners is the Taiwanese -- mainly Taiwanese but some Chinese factories we're buying from are running at about anywhere between 75% and 85% capacity and they're reluctant to push real hard on pricing because volume is the game for them. Our purchasing manager was just over there in Asia about two or three weeks ago and, in fact, Dan was with them, and that's what they saw when they were there."

We've talked to our guys a lot about it. We're pushing some, and we pushed some of our wholesale prices up, but it's a little bit of a longer cycle. And one of the things that happened in the fastener industry is Heads & Threads, which was the largest middle person. They were the largest distributor in the U.S. They bought from Asia and sold to distributors. They went out of business and this kind of settled the market a little bit right now. We're not sure where it's going. Again, we do anticipate fasteners going up. We're seeing increases as we speak, but we have to push those through to the customers. One big difference between now and 2007 and '08 is, in 2007 and '08, the angle was very clear. It was sharp and it was moving up. If you look at steel over the last year and a half, it's been rolling. It's generally rolling up, but it's going up and going down. It's a little bit harder to peg."

The mix shift is definitely keeping being both away from fasteners and with a lot of OEM business. Those two mix shifts have been holding our margin in check, quite frankly, for the last 15, 16 months. And it still holds it somewhat in check. The wildcard is, as Will just touched on, some of the inflation and how that plays out as we go into the year, we think there is a potential for some upside and as we cycle through our inventory that's on the shelf and the stuff we ordered last fall. But at the end of the day, you have to take a step back and appreciate the way we go to market and the way we price our product. We have 2,500 locations out there. We influence those locations, don't get me wrong, by periodic adjustments to our wholesale prices, pushing the group of store, the group of districts that maybe are performing on the bottom half of the group, I felt they are pushing them to rise to the performance of the remaining group. But at the end of the day, our pricings from day-to-day and from week to week is dictated by those 2,500 store managers and their support group and their local marketplace and their compensation programs, as we have always touched on. And that's why we always cite that 51% to 53% range. We think in a period of inflation, we can be in the upper half of that. In a period of deflation like we saw in 2009, it can dip a little bit."

China, Singapore, U.K. and Eastern Europe are the areas that we're seeing unusually good growth. Our International business as a whole was up. So you have, I think, about 49% and it was right at 50%, so that group of business grew at 50% to 49% year-over-year. But there is nothing unusual in that and Steven Rucinski, our Executive Vice President who runs that, is investing to maintain growth levels far above Fastenal. I'm not saying 49%, but he believes he can outpace the company by double digit margins for years to come if he continues to invest. If you look back historically at Fastenal, the constraints to investing were finding enough people and having enough cash. Steve doesn't have the cash problem because we can support him, and he has a large population of U.S. citizens that are willing to go and support his business in other areas of the world, so those are two things that he can work -- use to drive his growth for years to come."

Our information is always a bit cryptic because you have so many active accounts out there that make up the number. What I can tell you is, we're seeing is improvements in the trends, and it's not geographically limited. It's pretty well diverse across the continent. And so it's just you're seeing a pickup in activity. And like we saw when the markets really opened down, that was the last one to slow down because the projects, once they're funded -- you don't stop a building when you have 10-storey building, you have two stories left. But you might not start a new one or you might not start a new road project or a bridge. But when the energy starts going into getting that re-lit, again, there's a latency because there's funding constraints, there is permitting constraints, there is construction constraints, once it starts being lit, you see nice improvements, and they tend to be sustainable improvements. And that's what we're seeing right now. But it's well split across the country. As far as store openings, the 37 was a nice start to the year. It's on pace with the 150 to 200 we talked about. When I look at second quarter, we have a big customer show coming up in May, and so you will see some slippage in the openings probably in April and May because of that because all of our new stores ship out of that facility. We're trying to work around as much as possible, pre-prepping, if that's the correct word, some of the materials so we can maintain our store openings. But we're still confident about our 150 to 200 range for the year. As far as the closings, over the last several years, you've seen some closings. It's typically a case of people doing a nice job everyday of assessing their investments, their locations and where the best investment dollars need to be. In some markets, where we've seen very depressed situations, we've actually consolidated some of our stores. And part of that was on the managing of occupancy side. You had a market where we could easily service -- instead of having three locations, you could easily service the market out of two, you had a lease that was coming due, when you combine those stores. And I think that's always a good move and something that's healthy for a company to do every year. With that said, when I look at those markets, I still believe those markets will support additional stores in the future. I don't think this is a statement about any given markets or stores, it's really a statement about being prudent in the time that still is a weakened financial period, and our districts and regional leadership are making our decisions everyday."

That fill-in buy is an extremely expensive proposition for us. In a situation, where we have a very strong balance sheet and we have products that have very strong attributes from a gross margin standpoint, and we have a very, very good distribution system, we've been willing to let that inventory grow faster over the last few years. Two years ago, we contracted it quite dramatically as it reacts to the economic slowdown. But what we're really focusing our energy on everyday is, obviously, managing the growth and being smart about it. Buying a little bit of extra product last fall or even in the first quarter of this year, we floored some potential inflation, I think, so it’s a good move as long as you don’t get carried away with it. Then we're working every day to better position where our inventory is, does this belong is it better for this group of products to be in a store or in a distribution center to support our customers and their needs. So, I'm sure we'll grow this year, but we're very confident in our ability to continue to improve our inventory turns and our days on hand."

But it's not big projects where they're getting out to bulldozer and putting up 50-storey buildings. The real core of our construction strength non-res would first be energy, and a lot of that has to do with power plants and oil refineries. There is still some government spending, which would be typically buildings, courthouses, things like that, colleges, and then the medical industry continues to build -- a lot of it is like smaller clinics in rural -- new facilities. That's been good business for us. But overall, there is more activity and what we're seeing in a small scale is these renovations and things like that for people to pick up capacity.

The real exciting",1074,"Thank you, Ellen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped by an extra day, but we'll take it. The real exciting thing or the thing that makes us very optimistic about going into the year is our strong sequential trend. The way the quarter played out, we had a good January, and then it went a little bit soft in February. We believe it was due to weather, but then, we came back very strong in March, where our March daily average was 7% higher than our February daily average, much above our normal sequential trend. 
For the January to March trend, more historically, we would be up 6.2%. But this year, we're up 8.6%. So moving forward at a nice pace, and we're excited by the progress that we've made.
I feel good about our progress on the gross margin. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points over the first quarter of last year. It was even with the fourth quarter, but a lot of that is geography, and Dan's going to give a better report on that. But we're making nice progress working on our margin, and we're well within our 51% to 53% range that we talk about right in the middle of that. 
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A grew at 16.7%. And that's, I believe, they did a really good job or the group did a really good job on that. Labor was up when you put in all the health costs and all the other things, about 26% well above sales growth. But it's really being driven by the rebound of our bonuses, which we're very happy that, that's happening. Bonuses were up more than 100% year-over-year. So if we're going to spend money, that's the place to spend it. 
The other expenses, once you take the labor out, were actually flat to slightly down year-over-year, and that's just due to a strong focus on all the details. We learned a lot in the 2009 recession about where we needed to spend money and where we shouldn't be spending money, and it's coming through in the quarterly results in 2011.
From a pretax profit standpoint, we reported 20.1%. The first time that we've been over 20% in the first quarter for well over a decade. So we're proud of that. And it really puts us on a good track for our 'pathway to profit' progress that we talked about in the fourth quarter of being over 20%. So we're really moving towards the goals that we need to hit.
From a future standpoint, what we're looking for going forward, I'll start with a little history on that. At the beginning of 2010 -- really, the end of 2009, the beginning of 2010, we were really working hard to determine where we should invest in growth drivers outside of our normal new store openings. And the decisions we made were to add additional sales people at a higher level -- National Accounts, government sales, Automated Supply or vending and some product specialists, which we did.
So looking at those groups, our National Accounts business, we over invested in that group, was drawing very nicely. We have a lot of activity with the large customers. We've seen tremendous success with our government sales efforts. At the beginning of 2010, we've put in a Vice President of Government Sales. We restructured how we approach that business because we hadn't done is what we felt to be a very good job at chasing that business or trying to go out and get that business. 
John and his team, that new government sales rep, were very active in the last year, trying to understand the business. And at the end of 2010, we signed a contract with the TPCN, which is a purchasing network that represents state buyers. The beginning of this year, we signed a contract with WSCA, which is Western States Cooperative Alliance, which is also a large purchasing alliance that represents state and political subgroups. Basically, they negotiate deals for states and then states can opt-in with the bids. That business is not coming through yet because we're working out all the details. 
We think it has a lot potential for the future. Our large competitors have done a very nice job with that. So we're very optimistic with what we're doing with government sales going forward. And what it really does, if you think about it, it just expands the local market for a store because without these agreements, we really don't have the ability to sell to these local entities. With the agreement, it expands the market for the local store. 
Another area that we're optimistic about going into the future is our Fastenal Automated Supply Technology, otherwise known as vending. We've been investing in that program for about the last two to two and a half years. We really started at the beginning of 2009. We're seeing very nice progress. We're seeing good adoption from our customers, and our plan is to continue to invest in the automated supply and continue to roll that out to our customers. 
The other growth driver and probably the most important growth driver that we have is hiring quality people. What we foresee going into the rest of the year or the remainder of the year is, we'll continue to hire sales people, sales in the store and around the store at a rate of about 60% to 70% of sales growth. So that if we're able to grow our sales at 20%, we would put in 12% to 14% new head count into the stores. And then we will continue to hire support people at a lower rate but at a rate sufficient to support the sales growth, and that we had really seen most of those people would in distribution and manufacturing roles because that's really where we need the people to drive and support the sales going forward.
So although this is a brief report, I'm very happy with the quarter. I'd like to congratulate the Fastenal people that are on here today, and thank them for the effort that they put forth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to report and give us a more in-depth report."

And again, thank you for participating in our call. Today, much to everybody's pleasure, I will be very brief. Some of the highlights I'd note from our earnings release, again, on Pages 1 and 2, we highlight year-over-year growth patterns in our stores and in a subset of our stores, our two plus and our five plus. And I'm happy to report that the two and five year-old plus stores, they saw nice gains in the second half of 2010 as their growth was taking off. And we're seeing that continue in the first three months of 2011.
From a sequential sales pattern, as Will said, from January to March, despite the weather impacts in February, we've seen sequential gains that are well above our expected. In fact, March was about 2.4%, sequentially better than history would tell us it should be. And that bodes well if we go into the second and third quarters. And the information you hear out of ISM also bodes well as I look forward into the second and third quarters. From an end market perspective, manufacturing continues to hold strong. We are seeing a pickup in momentum in our construction end markets, which is one piece of our business that was lagging as we went through 2010 and seeing very nice sequential gains from that business.
'Pathway to profit', Will mentioned some of the investments we've been making on the people side. A few things that I'd point out. If I look at the store FTE, which is up about 12% from a year ago, since we started the 'pathway to profit', our store FTE is up about almost 23%. Our non-store selling personnel, the three areas that Will mentioned, as well as the investments and manufacturing sales personnel, is up 27% from where it was at the start of 2007. So a lot of additional selling energy embedded in our organization, not only over the last 12 months but over the last four years. 
If you look at DC and Manufacturing, our previous peak month was September 2008, and that's where our head count and distribution manufacturing had peaked. Right now, we're actually about 8.5% below that. A lot of that from the efficiencies we've gained in our investments in distribution over the last four to five years. If I would remove the Holo-Krome acquisition of late 2009, our manufacturing distribution head count is actually down about 12.5% from the peak in the fall 2008. And, again, largely credited to the efficiency gains that we've incorporated into our distribution systems over the last several years.
One of the things that we highlighted when we started the 'pathway to profit' was the efficiency we'd also seen in our support personnel because of the overhead that's associated with opening stores more than growing sales. And if I look at our support FTE, we're actually flat, down slightly, in fact, from where we were in the first quarter of 2007, the last quarter before the 'pathway to profit'. When we look at gross profit margin, as Will touched on, we're soundly in the middle of our long-term stated range of 51% to 53%, a range that we think allows for good, efficient growth of our business and serves well on our 'pathway to profit' initiative. 
If I look at the components of our gross margin on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis, our transactional margin improves. So it improved both from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 2010 to Q1 2011. Our organizational gross profit, which is really our buying scale -- that improved from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 to Q1. So we have nice momentum in the components that make up our gross margin. 
The third piece, when we look at the vendor allowances, everything from rebate programs to the way we move product with freight, et cetera, on a year-over-year basis, that's up nicely. On a Q4-to-Q1 basis, Q1 is more than normalized number. Q4 was actually a little bit higher than normal because of some rebate programs coming in stronger than we expected in late last year. So despite about a 30 basis point drop in that from Q4 to Q1, again, now we're back to a more normalized number. We were able to maintain our gross margins and that 30 basis point improvement all came from the first two categories I mentioned.
As Will touched on, our payroll and health care, our people cost included in SG&A, increased about 27% from a year ago. If you look at all the remaining expenses within SG&A, they're actually flat with the year ago, and that's our overall increase of about 17%. If I peel back that onion a little bit, there's a few things in there that were working against us. One is, as a distribution organization, we spend a fair amount on energy, both at our store locations and within our vehicles suite. If you look at some of the information we put into the earnings release, our diesel fuel is up about 25% from first quarter to first quarter. That's a per gallon cost. Our gasoline is up about 20% at a per gallon cost. All I can say that those two stats is ouch because that raised our fuel dollar spend by about 34% when you combine that with the growth in our business. 
If you look at occupancy, we did a nice job on that. We had some increases due to both energy costs that I've just mentioned, the new Holo-Krome facility in Connecticut that we moved into and increases in real estate taxes. But if I look at the actual rent dollars that we paid out, they were up about 2.5% from first quarter 2010.
Lastly, on the balance sheet side, on the working capital piece, I think we did a nice job managing both our accounts receivable growth and inventory growth when you factor in the added sales March to March. When I look at cash flow as a percentage of earnings, our operating cash came in at 93.4%. Typically, first quarter is seasonally high. Our stated range for that is 80% to 90% on annualized basis. We were able to announce for the first time in our history, a dividend for the second quarter. We announced a $0.26 dividend last night. And we also announced the intention of our board to migrate from a semi-annual dividend payment frequency to a quarterly payment frequency, and this is the first evidence of that.
The final thing I'll touch on, and this is just a little tidbit for the day. One thing that jumped out of me as I was looking at not only the quarter, but also the month of March and some activity in our stock price recently, this quarter appeared to be the quarter of tens for us. Now it's the first time in our history, our market capitalization snapped above $10 billion. And congratulations to all the Fastenal employees and shareholders on the call. 
Second, our International business is now 10.3% of sales. That's what it came out to in the first quarter. So we've made a nice transition over the last decade from primarily a North American business, but primarily a U.S. to truly an International Distribution business. 
And then the final piece is, if you noticed in our monthly sales release, our daily average for the month of March was $10,501,000 per day. That is the first month since September of 2008, where our daily average is over $10 million a day. And so it's nice to have the, finally, the shadow of the meltdown of late '08, early '09 behind us as we move into the rest of the year. 
With that, Will and I are open to questions. Thank you."

We plan to push prices up as soon as we can and hopefully capture incremental margin. But we're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation. If you look at the Asian steel and actually CRU, if you look at the April, May price per ton and you look at the December price per ton, steel was very flat throughout 2010. It has gone up in the first three months of this year. We have to understand, on the fastener side of our business, it's a long cycle. The product we buy, say in October of 2010, we'll be selling in June to October of 2011. We have about six to seven months worth of inventory, and it takes three to four months to get the product so it's a very long cycle. So we have not seen a lot of inflation in either the fasteners -- we've seen a little bit more in the non-fastener business, but we do anticipate inflation coming through, and we're hearing that from our suppliers. One of the reasons, we believe, we've not seen more inflation on the fasteners is the Taiwanese -- mainly Taiwanese but some Chinese factories we're buying from are running at about anywhere between 75% and 85% capacity and they're reluctant to push real hard on pricing because volume is the game for them. Our purchasing manager was just over there in Asia about two or three weeks ago and, in fact, Dan was with them, and that's what they saw when they were there."

Thanks, Will. And just as a quick follow-up to that, to our surveys, all the things we've been hearing about significant price increases in fasteners, some of our contacts from overseas, do you think you have an advantage relative to others in the markets, I mean, you look at competitively, are you seeing others being forced to raise prices at this time or in the near future? And, again, you might be able to operate under that umbrella for a while?"

We've talked to our guys a lot about it. We're pushing some, and we pushed some of our wholesale prices up, but it's a little bit of a longer cycle. And one of the things that happened in the fastener industry is Heads & Threads, which was the largest middle person. They were the largest distributor in the U.S. They bought from Asia and sold to distributors. They went out of business and this kind of settled the market a little bit right now. We're not sure where it's going. Again, we do anticipate fasteners going up. We're seeing increases as we speak, but we have to push those through to the customers. One big difference between now and 2007 and '08 is, in 2007 and '08, the angle was very clear. It was sharp and it was moving up. If you look at steel over the last year and a half, it's been rolling. It's generally rolling up, but it's going up and going down. It's a little bit harder to peg."

The mix shift is definitely keeping being both away from fasteners and with a lot of OEM business. Those two mix shifts have been holding our margin in check, quite frankly, for the last 15, 16 months. And it still holds it somewhat in check. The wildcard is, as Will just touched on, some of the inflation and how that plays out as we go into the year.  We think there is a potential for some upside and as we cycle through our inventory that's on the shelf and the stuff we ordered last fall. But at the end of the day, you always have to take a step back and appreciate the way we go to market and the way we price our product. We have 2,500 locations out there. We influence those locations, don't get me wrong, by periodic adjustments to our wholesale prices, pushing the group of stores, the group of districts that maybe are performing on the bottom half of the group that is out there -- pushing them to rise to the performance of the remaining group. But at the end of the day, our pricing from day-to-day and from week to week is dictated by those 2,500 store managers and their support group and their local marketplace and their compensation programs, as we have always touched on. And that's why we always cite that 51% to 53% range. We think in a period of inflation, we can be in the upper half of that. In a period of deflation like we saw in 2009, it can dip a little bit."

If you look at those things, they really took off in the second quarter of 2010 because that's when our growth really took off because first quarter of 2010, we still had a pretty weak quarter. Our year-over-year sales numbers were very weak. Our performance, again, driven by the economy was weaker. So this is really the fourth quarter of a period where our year-over-year comparisons on the labor side are in the situation we're in.

That was quite strong in the first half of 2010, but we even started seeing it last year where because the healthcare was getting more normal. Some things that really drove it up for us were, we had a lot of employees that switched from single coverage to family coverage and a lot of those situations where their spouse either lost insurance coverage or lost their job and they came on board, and family coverage is more expensive than single coverage. And part of it is because you're insuring more people, part of it because the population is typically a little bit older and whereas 20-year olds don't incur a lot of healthcare. And so when I look through the balance of the year, I feel very confident about our ability to manage both our payroll cost and that will improve as not only a percentage of sales, but the percent increase, and the remaining expenses will improve as well.

Our information is always a bit cryptic because you have so many active accounts out there that make up the number. What I can tell you is, we're seeing nice improvements in the trends, and it's not geographically limited. It's pretty well diverse across the continent. And so it's just you're seeing a pickup in activity. And like we saw when the markets really melted down, that was the last one to slow down because the projects, once they're funded -- you don't stop a building when you have 10-story building, you have two stories left. But you might not start a new one or you might not start a new road project or a bridge. But when the energy starts going into getting that re-lit, again, there's a latency because there's funding constraints, there is permitting constraints, there is construction constraints, once it starts being lit, you see nice improvements, and they tend to be sustainable improvements. And that's really what we're seeing right now. But it's well split across the country. As far as store openings, the 37 was a nice start to the year. It's on pace with the 150 to 200 we talked about. When I look at second quarter, we have a big customer show coming up in May, and so you will see some slippage in the openings probably in April and May because of that because all of our new stores ship out of that facility. We're trying to work around as much as possible, pre-prepping, if that's the correct word, some of the materials so we can maintain our store openings. But we're still confident about our 150 to 200 range for the year. As far as the closings, you know over the last several years, you've seen some closings. It's typically a case of people doing a nice job everyday of assessing their investments, their locations and where the best investment dollars need to be. In some markets, where we've seen very depressed situations, we've actually consolidated some of our stores. And part of that was on the managing of occupancy side. You had a market where we could easily service -- instead of having three locations, you could easily service the market out of two, you had a lease that was coming due, when you combine those stores. And I think that's always a good move and something that's healthy for a company to do every year. With that said, when I look at those markets, I still believe those markets will support additional stores in the future. I don't think this is a statement about any given markets or stores, it's really a statement about being prudent in the time that still is a weakened financial period, and our districts and regional leadership are making our decisions everyday."

But what we're really focusing our energy on everyday is, obviously, managing the growth and being smart about it. Buying a little bit of extra product last fall or even in the first quarter of this year, we floored some potential inflation, I think, so it’s a good move as long as you don’t get carried away with it.

So what we're doing at this point is, we're looking at all of our distribution centers. We have it kind of mapped out in a time line and where we predict, foresee the greatest sales growth and demand in over the next three to five years, we will be rolling this technology out into most of our distribution centers. Or, I'd say, it's three to seven years. And I'm sure as we go on, we'll find new technologies and new automation that make it even better and give us even a greater return, is what we would foresee because that's been our history."

The real exciting",1074,"Thank you, Ellen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very happy about the quarter. I think the Fastenal team performed well in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 23%. We were helped by an extra day, but we'll take it. The real exciting thing or the thing that makes us very optimistic about going into the year is our strong sequential trend. The way the quarter played out, we had a good January, and then it went a little bit soft in February. We believe it was due to weather, but then, we came back very strong in March, where our March daily average was 7% higher than our February daily average, much above our normal sequential trend. 
For the January to March trend, more historically, we would be up 6.2%. But this year, we're up 8.6%. So moving forward at a nice pace, and we're excited by the progress that we've made.
I feel good about our progress on the gross margin. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points over the first quarter of last year. It was even with the fourth quarter, but a lot of that is geography, and Dan's going to give a better report on that. But we're making nice progress working on our margin, and we're well within our 51% to 53% range that we talk about right in the middle of that. 
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A grew at 16.7%. And that's, I believe, they did a really good job or the group did a really good job on that. Labor was up when you put in all the health costs and all the other things, about 26% well above sales growth. But it's really being driven by the rebound of our bonuses, which we're very happy that, that's happening. Bonuses were up more than 100% year-over-year. So if we're going to spend money, that's the place to spend it. 
The other expenses, once you take the labor out, were actually flat to slightly down year-over-year, and that's just due to a strong focus on all the details. We learned a lot in the 2009 recession about where we needed to spend money and where we shouldn't be spending money, and it's coming through in the quarterly results in 2011.
From a pretax profit standpoint, we reported 20.1%. The first time that we've been over 20% in the first quarter for well over a decade. So we're proud of that. And it really puts us on a good track for our 'pathway to profit' progress that we talked about in the fourth quarter of being over 20%. So we're really moving towards the goals that we need to hit.
From a future standpoint, what we're looking for going forward, I'll start with a little history on that. At the beginning of 2010 -- really, the end of 2009, the beginning of 2010, we were really working hard to determine where we should invest in growth drivers outside of our normal new store openings. And the decisions we made were to add additional sales people at a higher level -- National Accounts, government sales, Automated Supply or vending and some product specialists, which we did.
So looking at those groups, our National Accounts business, we over invested in that group, was drawing very nicely. We have a lot of activity with the large customers. We've seen tremendous success with our government sales efforts. At the beginning of 2010, we've put in a Vice President of Government Sales. We restructured how we approach that business because we hadn't done is what we felt to be a very good job at chasing that business or trying to go out and get that business. 
John and his team, that new government sales rep, were very active in the last year, trying to understand the business. And at the end of 2010, we signed a contract with the TPCN, which is a purchasing network that represents state buyers. The beginning of this year, we signed a contract with WSCA, which is Western States Cooperative Alliance, which is also a large purchasing alliance that represents state and political subgroups. Basically, they negotiate deals for states and then states can opt-in with the bids. That business is not coming through yet because we're working out all the details. 
We think it has a lot potential for the future. Our large competitors have done a very nice job with that. So we're very optimistic with what we're doing with government sales going forward. And what it really does, if you think about it, it just expands the local market for a store because without these agreements, we really don't have the ability to sell to these local entities. With the agreement, it expands the market for the local store. 
Another area that we're optimistic about going into the future is our Fastenal Automated Supply Technology, otherwise known as vending. We've been investing in that program for about the last two to two and a half years. We really started at the beginning of 2009. We're seeing very nice progress. We're seeing good adoption from our customers, and our plan is to continue to invest in the automated supply and continue to roll that out to our customers. 
The other growth driver and probably the most important growth driver that we have is hiring quality people. What we foresee going into the rest of the year or the remainder of the year is, we'll continue to hire sales people, sales in the store and around the store at a rate of about 60% to 70% of sales growth. So that if we're able to grow our sales at 20%, we would put in 12% to 14% new head count into the stores. And then we will continue to hire support people at a lower rate but at a rate sufficient to support the sales growth, and that we had really seen most of those people would in distribution and manufacturing roles because that's really where we need the people to drive and support the sales going forward.
So although this is a brief report, I'm very happy with the quarter. I'd like to congratulate the Fastenal people that are on here today, and thank them for the effort that they put forth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to report and give us a more in-depth report."

And again, thank you for participating in our call. Today, much to everybody's pleasure, I will be very brief. Some of the highlights I'd note from our earnings release, again, on Pages 1 and 2, we highlight year-over-year growth patterns in our stores and in a subset of our stores, our two plus and our five plus. And I'm happy to report that the two and five year-old plus stores, they saw nice gains in the second half of 2010 as their growth was taking off. And we're seeing that continue in the first three months of 2011.
From a sequential sales pattern, as Will said, from January to March, despite the weather impacts in February, we've seen sequential gains that are well above our expected. In fact, March was about 2.4%, sequentially better than history would tell us it should be. And that bodes well if we go into the second and third quarters. And the information you hear out of ISM also bodes well as I look forward into the second and third quarters. From an end market perspective, manufacturing continues to hold strong. We are seeing a pickup in momentum in our construction end markets, which is one piece of our business that was lagging as we went through 2010 and seeing very nice sequential gains from that business.
'Pathway to profit', Will mentioned some of the investments we've been making on the people side. A few things that I'd point out. If I look at the store FTE, which is up about 12% from a year ago, since we started the 'pathway to profit', our store FTE is up about almost 23%. Our non-store selling personnel, the three areas that Will mentioned, as well as the investments and manufacturing sales personnel, is up 27% from where it was at the start of 2007. So a lot of additional selling energy embedded in our organization, not only over the last 12 months but over the last four years. 
If you look at DC and Manufacturing, our previous peak month was September 2008, and that's where our head count and distribution manufacturing had peaked. Right now, we're actually about 8.5% below that. A lot of that from the efficiencies we've gained in our investments in distribution over the last four to five years. If I would remove the Holo-Krome acquisition of late 2009, our manufacturing distribution head count is actually down about 12.5% from the peak in the fall 2008. And, again, largely credited to the efficiency gains that we've incorporated into our distribution systems over the last several years.
One of the things that we highlighted when we started the 'pathway to profit' was the efficiency we'd also seen in our support personnel because of the overhead that's associated with opening stores more than growing sales. And if I look at our support FTE, we're actually flat, down slightly, in fact, from where we were in the first quarter of 2007, the last quarter before the 'pathway to profit'. When we look at gross profit margin, as Will touched on, we're soundly in the middle of our long-term stated range of 51% to 53%, a range that we think allows for good, efficient growth of our business and serves well on our 'pathway to profit' initiative. 
If I look at the components of our gross margin on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis, our transactional margin improves. So it improved both from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 2010 to Q1 2011. Our organizational gross profit, which is really our buying scale -- that improved from Q1 to Q1 and from Q4 to Q1. So we have nice momentum in the components that make up our gross margin. 
The third piece, when we look at the vendor allowances, everything from rebate programs to the way we move product with freight, et cetera, on a year-over-year basis, that's up nicely. On a Q4-to-Q1 basis, Q1 is more than normalized number. Q4 was actually a little bit higher than normal because of some rebate programs coming in stronger than we expected in late last year. So despite about a 30 basis point drop in that from Q4 to Q1, again, now we're back to a more normalized number. We were able to maintain our gross margins and that 30 basis point improvement all came from the first two categories I mentioned.
As Will touched on, our payroll and health care, our people cost included in SG&A, increased about 27% from a year ago. If you look at all the remaining expenses within SG&A, they're actually flat with the year ago, and that's our overall increase of about 17%. If I peel back that onion a little bit, there's a few things in there that were working against us. One is, as a distribution organization, we spend a fair amount on energy, both at our store locations and within our vehicles suite. If you look at some of the information we put into the earnings release, our diesel fuel is up about 25% from first quarter to first quarter. That's a per gallon cost. Our gasoline is up about 20% at a per gallon cost. All I can say that those two stats is ouch because that raised our fuel dollar spend by about 34% when you combine that with the growth in our business. 
If you look at occupancy, we did a nice job on that. We had some increases due to both energy costs that I've just mentioned, the new Holo-Krome facility in Connecticut that we moved into and increases in real estate taxes. But if I look at the actual rent dollars that we paid out, they were up about 2.5% from first quarter 2010.
Lastly, on the balance sheet side, on the working capital piece, I think we did a nice job managing both our accounts receivable growth and inventory growth when you factor in the added sales March to March. When I look at cash flow as a percentage of earnings, our operating cash came in at 93.4%. Typically, first quarter is seasonally high. Our stated range for that is 80% to 90% on annualized basis. We were able to announce for the first time in our history, a dividend for the second quarter. We announced a $0.26 dividend last night. And we also announced the intention of our board to migrate from a semi-annual dividend payment frequency to a quarterly payment frequency, and this is the first evidence of that.
The final thing I'll touch on, and this is just a little tidbit for the day. One thing that jumped out of me as I was looking at not only the quarter, but also the month of March and some activity in our stock price recently, this quarter appeared to be the quarter of tens for us. Now it's the first time in our history, our market capitalization snapped above $10 billion. And congratulations to all the Fastenal employees and shareholders on the call. 
Second, our International business is now 10.3% of sales. That's what it came out to in the first quarter. So we've made a nice transition over the last decade from primarily a North American business, but primarily a U.S. to truly an International Distribution business. 
And then the final piece is, if you noticed in our monthly sales release, our daily average for the month of March was $10,501,000 per day. That is the first month since September of 2008, where our daily average is over $10 million a day. And so it's nice to have the, finally, the shadow of the meltdown of late '08, early '09 behind us as we move into the rest of the year. 
With that, Will and I are open to questions. Thank you."

We plan to push prices up as soon as we can and hopefully capture incremental margin. But we're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation. If you look at the Asian steel and actually CRU, if you look at the April, May price per ton and you look at the December price per ton, steel was very flat throughout 2010. It has gone up in the first three months of this year. We have to understand, on the fastener side of our business, it's a long cycle. The product we buy, say in October of 2010, we'll be selling in June to October of 2011. We have about six to seven months worth of inventory, and it takes three to four months to get the product so it's a very long cycle. So we have not seen a lot of inflation in either the fasteners -- we've seen a little bit more in the non-fastener business, but we do anticipate inflation coming through, and we're hearing that from our suppliers. One of the reasons, we believe, we've not seen more inflation on the fasteners is the Taiwanese -- mainly Taiwanese but some Chinese factories we're buying from are running at about anywhere between 75% and 85% capacity and they're reluctant to push real hard on pricing because volume is the game for them. Our purchasing manager was just over there in Asia about two or three weeks ago and, in fact, Dan was with them, and that's what they saw when they were there."

We've talked to our guys a lot about it. We're pushing some, and we pushed some of our wholesale prices up, but it's a little bit of a longer cycle. And one of the things that happened in the fastener industry is Heads & Threads, which was the largest middle person. They were the largest distributor in the U.S. They bought from Asia and sold to distributors. They went out of business and this kind of settled the market a little bit right now. We're not sure where it's going. Again, we do anticipate fasteners going up. We're seeing increases as we speak, but we have to push those through to the customers. One big difference between now and 2007 and '08 is, in 2007 and '08, the angle was very clear. It was sharp and it was moving up. If you look at steel over the last year and a half, it's been rolling. It's generally rolling up, but it's going up and going down. It's a little bit harder to peg."

The mix shift is definitely keeping being both away from fasteners and with a lot of OEM business. Those two mix shifts have been holding our margin in check, quite frankly, for the last 15, 16 months. And it still holds it somewhat in check. The wildcard is, as Will just touched on, some of the inflation and how that plays out as we go into the year.  We think there is a potential for some upside and as we cycle through our inventory that's on the shelf and the stuff we ordered last fall. But at the end of the day, you always have to take a step back and appreciate the way we go to market and the way we price our product. We have 2,500 locations out there. We influence those locations, don't get me wrong, by periodic adjustments to our wholesale prices, pushing the group of stores, the group of districts that maybe are performing on the bottom half of the group that is out there -- pushing them to rise to the performance of the remaining group. But at the end of the day, our pricing from day-to-day and from week to week is dictated by those 2,500 store managers and their support group and their local marketplace and their compensation programs, as we have always touched on. And that's why we always cite that 51% to 53% range. We think in a period of inflation, we can be in the upper half of that. In a period of deflation like we saw in 2009, it can dip a little bit."

That was quite strong in the first half of 2010, but we even started seeing it last year where because the healthcare was getting more normal. Some things that really drove it up for us were, we had a lot of employees that switched from single coverage to family coverage and a lot of those situations where their spouse either lost insurance coverage or lost their job and they came on board, and family coverage is more expensive than single coverage. And part of it is because you're insuring more people, part of it because the population is typically a little bit older and whereas 20-year olds don't incur a lot of healthcare. And so when I look through the balance of the year, I feel very confident about our ability to manage both our payroll cost and that will improve as not only a percentage of sales, but the percent increase, and the remaining expenses will improve as well.

Our information is always a bit cryptic because you have so many active accounts out there that make up the number. What I can tell you is, we're seeing nice improvements in the trends, and it's not geographically limited. It's pretty well diverse across the continent. And so it's just you're seeing a pickup in activity. And like we saw when the markets really melted down, that was the last one to slow down because the projects, once they're funded -- you don't stop a building when you have 10-story building, you have two stories left. But you might not start a new one or you might not start a new road project or a bridge. But when the energy starts going into getting that re-lit, again, there's a latency because there's funding constraints, there is permitting constraints, there is construction constraints, once it starts being lit, you see nice improvements, and they tend to be sustainable improvements. And that's really what we're seeing right now. But it's well split across the country. As far as store openings, the 37 was a nice start to the year. It's on pace with the 150 to 200 we talked about. When I look at second quarter, we have a big customer show coming up in May, and so you will see some slippage in the openings probably in April and May because of that because all of our new stores ship out of that facility. We're trying to work around as much as possible, pre-prepping, if that's the correct word, some of the materials so we can maintain our store openings. But we're still confident about our 150 to 200 range for the year. As far as the closings, over the last several years, you've seen some closings. It's typically a case of people doing a nice job everyday of assessing their investments, their locations and where the best investment dollars need to be. In some markets, where we've seen very depressed situations, we've actually consolidated some of our stores. And part of that was on the managing of occupancy side. You had a market where we could easily service -- instead of having three locations, you could easily service the market out of two, you had a lease that was coming due, when you combine those stores. And I think that's always a good move and something that's healthy for a company to do every year. With that said, when I look at those markets, I still believe those markets will support additional stores in the future. I don't think this is a statement about any given markets or stores, it's really a statement about being prudent in the time that still is a weakened financial period, and our districts and regional leadership are making our decisions every day."

But it's not big projects where they're getting out the bulldozer and putting up 50-story buildings. The real core of our construction strength non-res would first be energy, and a lot of that has to do with power plants and oil refineries. There is still some government spending, which would be typically buildings, courthouses, things like that, colleges, and then the medical industry continues to build -- a lot of it is like smaller clinics in rural -- new facilities. That's been good business for us. But overall, there is more activity and what we're seeing in a small scale is these renovations and things like that for people to pick up capacity.

We're very happy with the results. Sales came in as you know at 22.9%. Comfortable with that and we're happy that June came in as strong as it did. Looking at the ISM in May and other indications that it might be slowing down a little bit. But based on our June numbers, we think it's pretty steady and we're happy with that. 
Probably the most impressive thing for me in the sales results is our sequential pattern from January to June. Historically, we would've grown our sales, daily average sales from January to June at about 12.5%, 12.6%. But this year we're actually up 16.3% over that same time period. So it really put us in a good position for good growth through the rest of the year, and if we can maintain even our historical pattern it will put us in the good position for starting up 2012.
From an earnings standpoint, we did see some nice leverage. We reported 36.1% earnings growth, and the thing that makes me smile on this is that our operating margin came in at 21.4%, with 180 basis point gain over last year, and those of you that know the story well, we're talking about the 'pathway to profit' and trying to pick up 100 bps or basis points year-over-year each year going forward and we do about 180. If you haven't the earnings release by and if you look at Page 8 on that, if you look at the information on 'pathway to profit' and the store profitability, I sat and looked that there's a lot because it's exactly the model that Dan and I laid out 2 or 3 years ago oh when we talked about moving stores into larger categories. At the bottom, if you look at the 2 small categories of stores, basically the 30 to 60, 30 to 60, 2009, 61% of our stores are in that category. It dropped to 54% in 2010 and down to 36% this year. The largest that category was stores that are doing more than $100,000 per month. 
In 2009, 13.2% of our stores were there. That grew to 18.1% in 2010 and 23.3% combined in 2011. And so, the actual profitability per store size is not changed much. We really haven't improved that, especially in the large stores. You look at the over 150 stores excuse me Dan's correcting one of my numbers I'm adding something wrong. The small group of stores in 2011 timeframe is actually 42.6, -- 36. 6, excuse me, I put it reasonable for my mistake. But anyway, if you look at the larger stores, although 150, we were at 28.3 last year, 28.3 this year. But everything moves up into larger category and we had 180 basis points. That's really the point I'm trying to make. If we can continue to do that, we will march forward as our 'pathway to profit' reach our 23% operating goal. I understand the 23% operating goal is really just a point in time for us. If we do a great job maybe we could exceed that further into the future.
From a margin standpoint -- excuse me, expense -- on the expense control, I think we did a nice job. Our labor came in slightly higher than we expected it. We did a better than average job on the rest of the expenses so that offset it. So a little extra labor, although better job in occupancy and some of the other things that come in. Right where Dan and I expected beginning in the quarter. 
From the margin. We had a good range with the margin I know it earlier in the quarter there was a lot of talk from the investment community that we should be able to expand our margin and we were being very cautious on that because we weren't seeing the inflation that maybe some other companies were. So we're comfortable in the range we're in and that 51% to 53% range. I would see this as a stable pricing environment. We also have some opportunities going forward and probably the biggest opportunity going forward to a margin standpoint is our Fastenal Private Label brands. Right now, they represent about 7% of our total revenue, about 13% to 14% of our non-FAST on the revenue and in the non-FAST side, there's tremendous opportunity within meeting and working in that over the next 1 to 3 years we should be able to expand that product area and take that to the bottom line. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity for Fastenal Private Label going forward.
Back onto the sales a little bit, some of our initiatives. Our government sales initiative continues to move forward, reminding those a year ago like a year and half ago now at the beginning of 2010, we greatly increased our investment and trying to sell to the government. Since then, we've gone from a handful of state contracts to 27 state contracts at the end of this quarter very good progress. We're also working on some very nice federal government opportunities that we think some of those will come through over the next 3 to 6 months. So a lot of opportunity. And the way that we view this government opportunities is we're just expanding the local market for our stores. Because without these contracts, that market doesn't really exist for us. With the contracts it creates more opportunity for every store in each state we have a contract. So it's a pretty exciting thing going forward for our store people that we're able to sign up this business.
Another initiative that we've been working on his expanding our Cutting Tool business and going after some of more of the production cutting tools. As a reminder, we do about $100 million in cutting tools today. So it's not a new product line for us. We're probably, I would estimate at least a top 5 distributor in North America maybe closer to the 2 or 3 spot. So we are large distributor of cutting tools but we believe the opportunity is much bigger in the area is that -- first the reason we went after is we have hundreds of thousands of customers that are industrial customers that buy industrial cutting tools. The things that we needed to improve to be effective and as we get a broader product line at were in-depth and broader inventory, we needed sales expertise. And I believe we needed the vending solutions to be able to deliver that product within the plant. We feel very good about each of those areas. We've expanded them, we put people in teams to go after each area and expand and become better at it. And at this point, we're moving forward with what I believe is a very good plan. 
Just yesterday, I received a report back from a large industrial customer that we're working with that is experimenting using our vending systems to deliver their carbide inserts. And somewhat to my surprise, the report came back that they have customers actually see a 45% reduction in their consumption of carbide inserts. And what they attributed to is people are just more aware and are being watched. And I would've not expected that kind of reduction. So it's a really positive message for not only our Cutting Tool business but also our Vending business, our automated supply. 
And switching to another growth initiative would be Automated Supply. If you saw in Dan in the release, Dan puts a very good information in there, explaining our progress on vending and automated supply. Before I go to the numbers, just a little bit of background, even go forward. Today, most of our Automated Supply business is driven to our FAST 5000 and our locker system, which is a helix machine and we lock in to put other big products. Currently we're just taking first deliveries in our cutting tool machines. We have 2 of them, a smaller version, and a larger version. And once the serious traction with that, probably until late in the fourth quarter, early in next year, we're bringing machines in but it will take us a while to take them up and going. 
We also have other machines that were are in the development phase that should be rolling out at the end of fourth quarter and beginning of first quarter. Our goal is to build these help design and build machines that will distribute a wide range of our products, the more the better, and do it in a cost effective way so that the machines are economical and bring value for us and to our customers.
And if you look at the second quarter earnings report, the numbers there, as you can see, the first the numbers, if you look at our signings, you go back to the third quarter of 2010, where we signed 419 machines. That was really where we really cranked up our initiative, started putting in the wraps and started building what we call the machine behind the machine. All the company infrastructure to push this forward from the build centers to the technicians to the packaging department, all the things that are necessary. So it went from 419 to 776, 1,391 in the first quarter of 2011 to 2,100. So the momentum is with us in our Investor Day in May in Indianapolis. I said that our goal is to hit 1 machine per quarter per store, which will put us at about 2,500 to 2,600 or that is our goal and I'm not sure I'm not saying we're going to hit in the third quarter, but I'm comfortable that he will hit that goal some time in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we have good momentum and we keep pushing that up.
As far as the percent of our total revenue, as you can see it went from 6.4% in Q3 of last year, up to 10.8%. So it's a much broader base of business for us. And probably the most exciting thing is that, that group of customer, it's 10.8% of the customer business we represent, grew at 49.8% in the quarter. It's too big of a group to be just a coincidence. The vending is doing something more. It's even broader than that. We're providing greater service to this group of customers and we're reciprocating with a greater share of their business. And that's really what our goal was going in. Very efficient business growing very rapidly. So we're excited about that. 
So before I turn it over to the Dan, looking at all the things we have going on, our margin is stable, good expense control and good sales momentum, I'm very optimistic about the second half of the year that we can see in a similar range and continue to see above average growth for the rest of the year. 
Thank you very much, and I'll turn it over to Dan"

I'll touch on a handful of things to be fairly brief to try not to repeat too many things that Will touched on as well. But if I flipped through the earnings release something standout for me. 
As Will mentioned, our sales trends continues to improve. Gross margin continues to stay in that zone. It did uptick in the quarter, which was helpful. At continue to stay in that zone. When I look at the monthly store statistics, to me what's particularly powerful in there is what we're seeing from our older and more established stores. They continue to put very attractive numbers. I think they're held by a number of things. The initiates that Will talked about all feed well into that group of stores, whether that be the vending, the Government business, the selling through our Manufacturing business and now the cutting tools. Those all serve well in that population, as well as all stores, but particularly that population and you're seeing exceedingly strong numbers from that group. 
Sequential sales trends as Will touched, on history says by the middle of the year we should be up about 12.5% from where we were in January were up over 16% and I think that bodes well for the second half of the year and I think as Will mention, establishing our starting point for 2012. 
End market sales trends, manufacturing picked up some steam in the quarter. That's really what drove a big part of the driver of our strong sales trends. Our Manufacturing business, here I'm not talking about our manufacturing I'm talking about selling to manufacturing customers. That business continues to do well. I believe that vending is helping that business at a meaningful fashion. 
On the non-residential side, if I read the newspapers, I continue to be somewhat pleasantly surprised by our numbers. Our numbers could be stronger, but if you read what's in the newspaper our number is pretty darn good, because construction's not exactly a strong business right now.
As Will mention, we put in some vending stats this quarter. The thoughts that come to me when I look at that is A, there's new information. We're just laying out facts. Here are the numbers. We don't completely understand the percentage growth numbers, how much of that comes from vending, how much of that comes from spending relationship. I don't know that we frankly care to a certain degree. But we do know that the vending, the customer base of vending is growing far in excess than what that type of customer base would historically grow. And it's a big enough swap of customers. I think the trend is meaningful.
And when I look at things like the vending or different initiatives we've done over the last several years and trying to be able to do over the next several years, I believe we're continuing to position ourselves to put our local store in that position to be just the best supplier in the local market. And as long as we continue to do that, I believe we'll be successful because we've become the best partner for our customer base out there.
'Pathway to profit' average store size now at 80,000. Previous high was in Q3 of 2008. We were at 82,000. And what we continue to open stores since third quarter 2008 but we're almost factored in to that store size. That's really what's driving our profitability. It's simply the math. And if you look at that table on Page 8 and really understand the dynamics of the changing mix, you appreciate how the probability continues to drive. And the conclusion I get from it is that the 'pathway to profit' just works. 
The gross profit margin, as Will mentioned, stable gross profit. I believe private label opportunities are compelling. And I look forward to seeing how that impacts our ability to manage our business for the next several years. Operating initiative expenses, good expense control. As Will mention, our payroll increased still wasn't what we expected, but with a nice profit a lot of our incentive compensation, both at the store level and at the district and regional level as well. Healthcare was a bit problematic for us in 2009 and equivalent in 2010 continues to manage pretty well in the current environment.
Occupancy, as was disclosed in our report was up 5.1% for the quarter. The real story there is the energy cost component. We continue to do well on our rent costs. If you look at our actual rent dollars paid they were up 3% for the quarter per second quarter to second quarter on a base of 6.3% more stores. So we continue to manage well through that. I still believe there's opportunity for savings as we go forward, and we continue to work hard on beginning after the savings. A few dollars spent as you saw are up over 50% for the year-ago, really driven by diesel increases of over $30 and gasoline per gallon cost up mid-30s. We're managing through it, we're managing through it well. 
Working capital. I believe we continue to manage that appropriately. If I look at the May, June timeframe which really drives the sales, down the quarter, we had an extra day. We were down a day in April, but we gained that day back in May. But we're up 25.5%. Our accounts receivable are up just over 27%. A little bit of anarchy that postal strike up in Canada, some AR but that will the postal strike will settle at the end of the quarter. So that will crack itself is a going to July.
Inventory were up 16.5% in the 6-month. period. That's frankly 1 we'd like to see, but we continue I believe to manage that well and with the initiatives we have going on starting to work hard to manage that as we go to the tail end of the year. We just announced last night, yesterday evening, our third quarter dividend, $0.13 per share payable in August and. As I close out of my comments and prepare for the questions, I guess the 5 things that stand out to me when I look at the quarter just to summarized: Number 1, 'pathway to profit', the fundamentals of it just work; number 2, very good sales patterns; number 3, very good traction with our sales initiatives, international national accounts, manufacturing business, our automated solutions and cutting tools which is pretty early in the game so it's hard to really affect at this point but very good opportunities there; number 4, very good opportunities with Private Label to help our gross margin over time; and finally, our employees at Fastenal performing at the high level. And I thank them for their efforts this quarter. 
With that, I turn it over to questions."

Other margin things, what we've done is we've taken the expense, the depreciation and the capital expense of vending, put that against our operating expenses as we look that it is nothing other than an offset storage and we want our leadership, our managers and DMs to think of it that way so if they have a big vending base, we need a smaller store. We don't want an incremental expenses out of this. We believe we have it pretty well understood and positioned within our P&L and our paid programs. It's really a growth driver, and it's a solution for our customers to save money and run their businesses better and it actually plays out to be better for our customers. It should give us long term growth. And that's really what we're focusing on. I'm probably the most bullish person on this and maybe in the investor distribution. It's a solution that works.

Comfortable with that and we're happy that June came in as s",1892,"Thanks, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to announce our second quarter earnings. We're very happy with the results. Sales came in, as you know, at 22.9%. Comfortable with that and we're happy that June came in as strong as it did, looking at the ISM in May and other indications that it might be slowing down a little bit. But based on our June numbers, we think it's pretty steady and we're happy with that. 
Probably the most impressive thing for me in the sales results is our sequential pattern from January to June. Historically, we would've grown our sales, daily average sales, from January to June at about 12.5%, 12.6%. But this year we're actually up 16.3% over that same time period. So it really put us in a good position for good growth through the rest of the year. If we can maintain even our historical pattern, it would put us in the good position for starting out 2012.
From an earnings standpoint, we did see some nice leverage. We reported 36.1% earnings growth, and the thing that makes me smile on this is that our operating margin came in at 21.4%, with 180 basis point gain over last year. And those of you that know the story well, we're talking about the 'pathway to profit' and trying to pick up 100 bps or basis points year-over-year each year going forward and we're able to do 180. If you have the earnings release by and if you look at Page 8 on that, if you look at the information on 'pathway to profit' and the store profitability, I sat and looked at this a lot because it's exactly the model that Dan and I had laid out 2 or 3 years ago when we talked about moving stores into larger categories. At the bottom, if you look at the 2 small categories of stores, basically the $30,000 to $60,000 -- or $0 to $30,000 and $30,000 to $60,000, in 2009, 61% of our stores are in that category. It dropped to 54% in 2010 and down to 36% this year. 
In the largest of categories, the stores that are doing more than $100,000 per month, in 2009, 13.2% of our stores were there. That grew to 18.1% in 2010 and 23.3% combined in 2011. And so the actual profitability per store size has not changed much. We really haven't improved that, especially in the large stores. You look at the over 150 stores -- excuse me, Dan's correcting one of my numbers as I'm going here. I added something wrong. The small group of stores in the 2011 timeframe is actually 42.6, -- 46 -- excuse me, I put a 3 instead of a 4, my mistake. But anyway, if you look at the larger stores, over $150,000, we were at 28.3% last year, 28.3% this year. But everything moves up into a larger category, and we had 180 basis points. That's really the point I'm trying to make. If we can continue to do that, we will march forward as our 'pathway to profit' reach our 23% operating goal. I understand the 23% operating goal is really just a point in time for us. If we do a great job, maybe we can exceed that further into the future.
From a margin standpoint -- excuse me, I missed the expense. On the expense control, I think we did a nice job. Our labor came in slightly higher than we expected it. But we did a better than average job on the rest of the expenses, so it offset it. So a little extra labor, a little better job at occupancy and some of the other things, they all start to come in right where Dan and I had expected beginning the quarter. 
On the margin. We had a good range with the margin. I noted earlier in the quarter there was a lot of talk from the investment community that we should be able to expand our margin, and we are being very cautious on that because we weren't seeing the inflation that maybe some other companies were. So we're comfortable in the range we're in, in that 51% to 53% range. I would [indiscernible] this as a stable pricing environment. We also have some opportunities going forward and probably the biggest opportunity going forward from a margin standpoint is our Fastenal private label brands. Right now they represent about 7% of our total revenue, about 13% to 14% of the non-Fastenal revenue. And in the non-Fastenal side, there's tremendous opportunity. We've been meeting and working on that, and over the next 1 to 3 years we should be able to expand that product area and take that to the bottom line. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity for Fastenal private label going forward.
Back onto the sales a little bit, some of our initiatives. Our government sales initiative continues to move forward, reminding those a year ago, like 1.5 years ago now in the beginning of 2010, we greatly increased our investment in trying to sell to the government. Since then, we've gone from a handful of state contracts to 27 state contracts at the end of this quarter. Very good progress. We're also working on some very nice federal government opportunities that we think some of those will come through over the next 3 to 6 months. So a lot of opportunity. And the way that we view this government opportunity is we're just expanding the local market for our stores because without these contracts, that market doesn't really exist for us. With the contracts, it creates more opportunity for every store in each state that we have a contract. So it's a pretty exciting thing going forward for our store people that we're able to sign up this business.
Another initiative that we've been working on is expanding our cutting tool business and going after some of more of the production cutting tools. As a reminder, we do about $100 million in cutting tools today. So it's not a new product line for us. We're probably, I would estimate, at least a top 5 distributor in North America and maybe closer to the 2 or 3 spot. So we are a large distributor of cutting tools, but we believe the opportunity is much bigger in the areas that -- first, the reason we went after is we have hundreds of thousands of customers that are industrial customers that buy industrial cutting tools. The things that we needed to improve to be effective in it is we needed a broader product line, more in-depth and broader inventory. We needed sales expertise, and I believe we needed the vending solutions to be able to deliver that product within the plant. We feel very good about each of those areas. We've expanded them, we put people in teams to go after each area and expand and become better at it. And at this point, we're moving forward with what I believe is a very good plan. 
Just yesterday, I received a report back from a large industrial customer that we're working with that is experimenting using our vending systems to deliver their carbide inserts. And somewhat to my surprise, the report came back that they have -- this customer has actually seen a 45% reduction in their consumption of carbide inserts. And what they attributed to it is people are just more aware and are being watched. And I would not have expected that kind of a reduction. So it's a really positive message for not only our cutting tool business but also our vending business, our automated supply. 
And switching to another growth initiative would be automated supply. If you saw on Dan -- in the release, Dan put some very good information in there, explaining our progress on vending and automated supply. Before I go to the numbers, just a little bit of background, even go forward. Today, most of our automated supply business is driven through our FAST 5000 and our locker system, which is a helix machine and then a locker to put other bigger products. Currently, we're just taking first deliveries on our cutting tool machines. We have 2 of them, a smaller version and a larger version. And we want the serious traction with that, probably till late in the fourth quarter, early in next year, we're bringing machines in but it'll take us a while to get that up and going. 
We also have other machines that are in the development phase that should be rolling out at the end of fourth quarter and beginning of first quarter. Our goal is to build these -- help design and build machines that would distribute a wide range of our products, the more the better, and do it in a cost-effective way so that the machines are economical and bring value to both us and to our customers.
And if you look at the second quarter earnings report, the numbers there, as you can see, the first set of numbers, if you look at our signings, you go back to the third quarter of 2010 where we signed 419 machines. That was really where we really cranked up our initiative, started putting in the reps and started building what we call the machine behind the machine. All the company infrastructure to push this forward from the build centers to the technicians to the packaging department, all the things that are necessary. So it went from 419 to 776, 1,391 in the first quarter of 2011 to 2,100. So the momentum is with us. At our Investor Day in May in Indianapolis, I said that our goal is to hit 1 machine per quarter per store, which would put us at about 2,500 to 2,600. That is our goal. I'm not sure -- I'm not saying we will hit it in the third quarter, but I'm comfortable that we will hit that goal some time in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we have good momentum, and we keep pushing that up.
As far as the percent of our total revenue, as you can see, it went from 6.4% in Q3 of last year, up to 10.8%, so it's a much broader base of business for us. And probably the most exciting thing is that, that group of customer, the 10.8% of the customer business we represent, grew at 49.8% in the quarter. It's too big of a group to be just a coincidence. The vending is doing something or -- it's even broader than that. We're providing greater service to this group of customers and they're reciprocating with a greater share of their business. And that's really what our goal was going in. Very efficient business, growing very rapidly. So we're excited about that. 
So before I turn it over to the Dan, looking at all the things we have going on, our margin is stable, good expense control and good sales momentum, I'm very optimistic about the second half of the year that we can see in a similar range and continue to see above average growth for the rest of the year. 
Thank you very much, and I'll turn it over to Dan."

But if I flip",1220,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And I would also wish to thank you for joining in on our call today. I'll touch on a handful of things. I'll be fairly brief, but I'll try not to repeat too many things that Will touched on as well. But if I flipped through the earnings release, some things stand out for me. 
As Will mentioned, our sales trend continues to improve. Our gross margin continues to stay in that zone. We talked about it. It did uptick in the quarter, which was helpful, but it continues to stay in that zone. When I look at the monthly store statistics, to me what's particularly powerful in there is seeing from our older and more established stores. They continue to put out very attractive numbers. I think they're held by a number of things. The initiates that Will talked about all feed well into that group of stores, whether that be the vending, the government business, the selling through our manufacturing business and now the cutting tools. Those all serve well that population, as well as all stores, but particularly that population. And you're seeing exceedingly strong numbers from that group. 
Sequential sales trends, as Will touched on. History says by the middle of the year, we should be up about 12.5% from where we were in January. We're up over 16%. And I think that bodes well for the second half of the year and as Will mentioned, establishing our starting point for 2012. 
End market sales trends. Manufacturing picked up some steam in the quarter. That's really what drove a big part of the driver of our strong sales trends, our manufacturing business. And here I'm not talking about our manufacturing. I'm talking about selling to manufacturing customer base. That business continues to do well. I believe vending is helping that business in a meaningful fashion. 
On the non-residential side, if I read the newspapers, I continue to be somewhat pleasantly surprised by our numbers. Our numbers could be stronger, but if you read what's in the newspaper, our numbers are pretty darn good because construction is not exactly our strong business right now.
As Will mentioned, we put in some vending stats this quarter. The thoughts that come to me when I look at that is A, there's new information -- we're just laying out facts. Here are the numbers. We don't completely understand the percentage growth numbers, how much of that comes from vending, how much of that comes from just the expanding relationship. I don't know that we frankly care to a certain degree. But we do know that the vending, the customer base of vending is growing far in excess than what that type of customer base would historically grow. And it's a big enough swathe of customers. I think the trend is meaningful.
And when I look at things like the vending or different initiatives that we've done over the last several years and plan to do over the next several years, I believe we're continuing to position ourselves to put our local store in that position to be just the best supplier in our local market. And as long as we continue to do that, I believe we'll be successful and strong [ph] organization because we've become the best partner for our customer base out there.
'Pathway to profit.' Average store size is now at 80,000. Previous high was in Q3 of 2008. We were at 82,000. But we've continued to open stores since third quarter 2008, but we're almost back to that average store size. That's really what's driving our profitability. It's simply the math. And if you look at that table on Page 8 and really understand the dynamics of the changing mix, you appreciate how the profitability continues to drive. And the conclusion I get from it is that the 'pathway to profit' just works. 
The gross profit margin. As Will mentioned, stable gross profit. I believe private label opportunities are compelling. And I look forward to seeing how that impacts our ability to manage our business for the next several years. 
Operating and administrative expenses. Good expense control. As Will mentioned, our payroll increased a little bit more than we expected, but with the nice profits, that drives a lot of our incentive compensation both at the store level and at the district and regional level as well. Health care was problematic for us in 2009 and improved in 2010. We continue to manage it very well in the current environment.
Occupancy. As was disclosed in our report, it was up 5.1% for the quarter. The real story there is the energy cost component. We continue to do well on our rent costs. If you look at our actual rent dollars paid, they were up 3% for the quarter -- per second quarter to second quarter on a base of 6.3% more stores. So we continue to manage well through that. I still believe there's opportunities for savings as we go forward, and we continue to work hard on getting after those savings. A few dollars spent, as you saw, are up over 50% from year ago, really driven by diesel increases of over $30 and gasoline per gallon cost up mid-30s. [indiscernible] but we're managing through it and we're managing through it well. 
Working capital. I believe we continue to manage that appropriately. If I look at the May, June timeframe, which really drives the sales -- I mean, it drives but you can't see within the quarter, we had an extra day. We were down a day in April, but we've gained that day back in May. So our dollars [ph] build [ph] in May and June were up 25.5%. Our accounts receivable are up just over 27%. 
A little bit of addend [ph] to that. The postal strike up in Canada added some AR, but that will correct itself. The postal strike will settle by the end of the quarter and so that will correct itself as we go into July.
Inventory were up 16.5% in the 6-month period. That's quite frankly one we'd like to see. But we continue to, I believe, manage that well and with the initiatives we have going on driving some of the increase, but we'll work hard to manage that as we go through the tail end of the year. 
We just announced last night, yesterday evening, our third quarter dividend, $0.13 per share. That'll be payable in August. 
And as I close out my comments and prepare for the questions, I guess the 5 things that stand out for me when I look at the quarter, just to summarize: Number one, 'pathway to profit'. The fundamentals of it just work. Number two, very good sales patterns. Number three, very good traction with our sales initiatives. International, national account, manufacturing business, our automated solutions and cutting tools which is pretty early in the game so it's hard to really affect that at this point, but very good opportunities there. Number four, very good opportunities with private label to help our gross margin over time. And finally, our employees at Fastenal performing at a high level. And I thank them for their efforts this quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to questions."

Other margin things, what we've done is we've taken the expense, the depreciation, the capital expense of vending, put that against our operating expenses because we look at it as nothing other than an offsite storage. And we want our leadership, our managers and DMs to think of it that way, so if they have a big vending base, they need a smaller store. We don't want incremental expenses out of this, and we believe we have that pretty well understood and positioned within our P&L and our paid programs.

And in the first figure, what we're really try to do is communicate what's the pace. How many machines are we signing that quarter, and there's always going to be a lag. The machine that we signed up the last week of June, or June in general, those machines -- what happens after a machine is signed, you sit down with a customer and you go through and you decide what SKUs are going to go into this machine. And we're working every day to shorten that window up and provide our customers with better information. Basically, provide them here's what we think would work for your business. But there's always going to be that lag between the deciding process and what products go in and then they're then actually placing the machines in the plant. But at the end of the quarter, we had just over 4,000 machines. If you look at it, we -- the jump up from Q3 to Q4 and then from Q4 to Q1 and then Q1 to Q2, really is a lag from the signings in the table right above it."

We have about a 90-day backlog, which is great from a go forward on sales. But our frustration, mine and Dan's and the other leaders', is let's shorten that up to 50 or 60. Most of that is being held up at the customer side with them struggling to make the decision on what do I put in the machine. And we're working hard to give them, to give the customers better tools, give our people better tools. And our goal is to get that down. We'll probably not get it much below 60 days. It just takes a certain amount of time to do the end, so part of it is they have to bring in clean Internet lines outside of their system. And that's always -- in many cases, it takes 8 weeks just to get the Internet lines. Because the customer doesn't want this running through their IT system. They want a fresh line outside of the plant. There are a lot of details that I'm not familiar with, that I don't know exactly how they work. So we have a big backlog installed, and we have great momentum on signings."

It came in at a very strong finish in June, the strongest finish we've ever had, which has really turned out to be a good month. Geographically, it was pretty even. We don't have any real soft spots. If anything, the eastern half of the United States is a little softer than the west. I think a little bit of that is driven by a little uncertainty in the auto industry or there was some uncertainty there in the late May and some of that. Overall, the entire business did well. International did exceptionally well. It grew at about almost 50%. Regionally, there was no one that was doing great. Some of the areas like the Southwest, the oil belt down there has cooled off a little bit. They're still ahead of the company, but in the first quarter they were well ahead of the company. So that softened up a little bit. Midwest remained strong. And I think a lot of that is being driven by optimism in the ag industry and a lot of the agricultural business is doing really well with a $7 corn.

It might be a market that I had 3 stores. I went to 4. I have a lease coming due in one of the stores, and I think I could serve the market better with 3 than 4. And in an environment where I have all the things in my arsenal, including vending, that might be a better solution.

Comfortable with that, and we're happy that June came in as",1899,"Thanks, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to announce our second quarter earnings. We're very happy with the results. Sales came in, as you know, at 22.9%. Comfortable with that, and we're happy that June came in as strong as it did, looking at the ISM in May and other indications that it might be slowing down a little bit. But based on our June numbers, we think it's pretty steady, and we're happy with that. 
Probably the most impressive thing for me in the sales results is our sequential pattern from January to June. Historically, we would've grown our sales, daily average sales, from January to June at about 12.5%, 12.6%. But this year we're actually up 16.3% over that same time period. So it really put us in a good position for good growth through the rest of the year. If we can maintain even our historical pattern, it would put us in a good position for starting out 2012.
From an earnings standpoint, we did see some nice leverage. We reported 36.1% earnings growth, and the thing that makes me smile on this is that our operating margin came in at 21.4%. It was a 180-basis-point gain over last year. And those of you that know the story well, we're talking about the “pathway to profit” and trying to pick up 100 bps or basis points year-over-year each year going forward, and we're able to do 180. If you have the earnings release by you and if you look at Page 8 on that, if you look at the information on “pathway to profit” and the store profitability, I sat and looked at this a lot because it's exactly the model that Dan and I had laid out 2 or 3 years ago when we talked about moving stores into larger categories. At the bottom, if you look at the 2 small categories of stores, basically the $30,000 to $60,000 -- or $0 to $30,000 and $30,000 to $60,000, in 2009, 61% of our stores are in that category. It dropped to 54% in 2010 and down to 36% this year. 
In the largest 2 categories, the stores that are doing more than $100,000 per month, in 2009, 13.2% of our stores were there. That grew to 18.1% in 2010 and 23.3% combined in 2011. And so the actual profitability per store size has not changed much. We really haven't improved that, especially in the large stores. You look at the over $150,000 stores -- excuse me, Dan's correcting one of my numbers as I'm going here. I added something wrong. The small group of stores in the 2011 timeframe is actually 42.6, -- 46 -- excuse me, I put a 3 instead of a 4, my mistake. But anyway, if you look at the larger stores, over $150,000, we were at 28.3% last year, 28.3% this year. But everything moves up into a larger category, and we had 180 basis points. That's really the point I'm trying to make. If we can continue to do that, we will march forward as our “pathway to profit,” reach our 23% operating goal. But understand the 23% operating goal is really just a point in time for us. If we do a great job, maybe we can exceed that further into the future.
From a margin standpoint -- excuse me, I missed the expense. On the expense control, I think we did a nice job. Our labor came in slightly higher than we expected it. But we did a better than average job on the rest of the expenses, so it offset it. So a little extra labor, a little better job at occupancy and some of the other things, so it balanced out to come in right where Dan and I had expected beginning the quarter. 
For the margin. We’re in a good range with the margin. I know earlier in the quarter there was a lot of talk from the investment community that we should be able to expand our margin, and we were being very cautious on that because we weren't seeing the inflation that maybe some other companies were. So we're comfortable in the range we're in, in that 51% to 53% range. I would describe this as a stable pricing environment. We also have some opportunities going forward and probably the biggest opportunity going forward from a margin standpoint is our Fastenal private label brands. Right now they represent about 7% of our total revenue, about 13% to 14% of the non-fastener revenue. And in the non-fastener side, there's a tremendous opportunity. We've been meeting and working on that, and over the next 1 to 3 years we should be able to expand that product area and take that to the bottom line. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity for Fastenal private label going forward.
Back onto the sales a little bit, some of our initiatives. Our government sales initiative continues to move forward, reminding those a year ago -- well, actually 1.5 years ago now in the beginning of 2010, we greatly increased our investment in trying to sell to the government. Since then, we've gone from a handful of state contracts to 27 state contracts at the end of this quarter. Very good progress. We're also working on some very nice federal government opportunities that we think some of those will come through over the next 3 to 6 months. So a lot of opportunity. And the way that we view this government opportunity is we're just expanding the local market for our stores because without these contracts, that market doesn't really exist for us. With the contracts, it creates more opportunity for every store in each state that we have a contract. So it's a pretty exciting thing going forward for our store people when we're able to sign up this business.
Another initiative that we've been working on is expanding our cutting tool business and going after some of more of the production cutting tools. As a reminder, we do about $100 million in cutting tools today. So it's not a new product line for us. We're probably, I would estimate, at least a top 5 distributor in North America and maybe closer to the 2 or 3 spot. So we are a large distributor of cutting tools, but we believe the opportunity is much bigger in the areas that -- first, the reason we went after is we have hundreds of thousands of customers that are industrial customers that buy industrial cutting tools. The things that we needed to improve to be effective in it is we needed a broader product line, more in-depth and broader inventory. We needed sales expertise, and I believe we needed the vending solutions to be able to deliver that product within the plant. We feel very good about each of those areas. We've expanded them. We put people in teams to go after each area and expand and become better at it. And at this point, we're moving forward with what I believe is a very good plan. 
Just yesterday, I received a report back from a large industrial customer that we're working with that is experimenting using our vending systems to deliver their carbide inserts. And somewhat to my surprise, the report came back that they have -- this customer has actually seen a 45% reduction in their consumption of carbide inserts. And what they attributed to it is people are just more aware, and they’re being watched. And I would not have expected that kind of a reduction. So it's a really positive message for not only our cutting tool business but also our vending business, our automated supply. 
And switching to another growth initiative would be automated supply. If you saw on Dan -- in the release, Dan put some very good information in there, explaining our progress on vending and automated supply. Before I go to the numbers, just a little bit of background, even go forward. Today, most of our automated supply business is driven through our FAST 5000 and our locker system, which is a helix machine and then a locker to put other bigger products. Currently, we're just taking first deliveries on our cutting tool machines. We have 2 of them, a smaller version and a larger version. And we won’t see serious traction with that, probably till late in the fourth quarter, early in next year, we're bringing machines in but it'll take us a while to get that up and going. 
We also have other machines that are in the development phase that should be rolling out at the end of fourth quarter and beginning of first quarter. Our goal is to build these -- help design and build machines that would distribute a wide range of our products, the more the better and do it in a cost-effective way so that the machines are economical and bring value to both us and to our customers.
And if you look at the second quarter earnings report, the numbers there, as you can see, the first set of numbers, if you look at our signings, you go back to the third quarter of 2010 where we signed 419 machines. That was really where we really cranked up our initiative, started putting in the reps and started building what we call the machine behind the machine, all the company infrastructure to push this forward from the build centers to the technicians to the packaging department, all the things that are necessary. So it went from 419 to 776, 1,391 in the first quarter of 2011 to 2,100. So the momentum is with us. At our Investor Day in May in Indianapolis, I said that our goal was to hit 1 machine per quarter per store, which would put us at about 2,500 to 2,600. That is our goal. I'm not sure that we will -- I'm not saying we will hit it in the third quarter, but I'm comfortable that we will hit that goal sometime in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we have good momentum, and we keep pushing that up.
As far as the percent of our total revenue, as you can see, it went from 6.4% in Q3 of last year, up to 10.8%, so it's a much broader base of business for us. And probably the most exciting thing is that, that group of customers, the 10.8% of the customer business we represent, grew at 49.8% in the quarter. It's too big of a group to be just a coincidence. The vending is doing something or -- it's even broader than that. We're providing greater service to this group of customers, and they're reciprocating with a greater share of their business. And that's really what our goal was going in. Very efficient business, growing very rapidly. So we're excited about that. 
So before I turn it over to the Dan, looking at all the things we have going on, our margin is stable, good expense control and good sales momentum, I'm very optimistic about the second half of the year that we can stay in a similar range and continue to see above average growth for the rest of the year. 
Thank you very much, and I'll turn it over to Dan."

But if I flip th",1217,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And I would also wish to thank you for joining in our call today. I'll touch on a handful of things. I'll be fairly brief, but I'll try not to repeat too many things that Will touched on as well. But if I flip through the earnings release, some things stand out for me. 
As Will mentioned, our sales trend continued to improve. Our gross margin continues to stay in that zone we talked about it. It did uptick in the quarter, which was helpful, but it continues to stay in that zone. When I look at the monthly store statistics, to me what's particularly powerful in there is seeing from our older and more established stores. They continue to put out very attractive numbers. I think they're helped by a number of things. The initiates that Will talked about all feed well into that group of stores, whether that be the vending, the government business, the selling through our manufacturing business and now the cutting tools. Those all serve well that population, as well as all stores, but particularly that population. And you're seeing exceedingly strong numbers from that group. 
Sequential sales trends, as Will touched on. History says by the middle of the year, we should be up about 12.5% from where we were in January. We're up over 16%. And I think that bodes well for the second half of the year and, as Will mentioned, establishing our starting point for 2012. 
End market sales trends. Manufacturing picked up some steam in the quarter. That's really what drove a big part of the driver of our strong sales trends, our manufacturing business. And here I'm talking not about our manufacturing. I'm talking about selling to manufacturing customer base. That business continues to do well. I believe vending is helping that business in a meaningful fashion. 
On the non-residential side, if I read the newspapers, I continue to be somewhat pleasantly surprised by our numbers. Our numbers could be stronger, but if you read what's in the newspaper, our numbers are pretty darn good because construction is not exactly our strong business right now.
As Will mentioned, we put in some vending stats this quarter. The thoughts that come to me when I look at that is, A, there's new information -- we're just laying out facts. Here are the numbers. We don't completely understand the percentage growth numbers, how much of that comes from vending, how much of that comes from just the expanding relationship. I don't know that we frankly care to a certain degree. But we do know that the vending, the customer base with vending is growing far in excess than what that type of customer base would historically grow. And it's a big enough swathe of customers. I think the trend is meaningful.
And when I look at things like the vending or different initiatives that we've done over the last several years and plan to do over the next several years, I believe we're continuing to position ourselves to put our local store in that position to be just the best supplier in that local market. And as long as we continue to do that, I believe we'll be successful as an organization because we become the best partner for our customer base out there.
“Pathway to profit.” Average store size is now at 80,000. Previous high was in Q3 of 2008, we were at 82,000. But we've continued to open stores since third quarter 2008, but we're almost back to that average store size. That's really what's driving our profitability. It's simply the math. And if you look at that table on Page 8 and really understand the dynamics of the changing mix, you appreciate how the profitability continues to drive. And the conclusion I get from it is the “pathway to profit” just works. 
The gross profit margin. As Will mentioned, stable gross profit. I believe private label opportunities are compelling. And I look forward to seeing how that impacts our ability to manage our business for the next several years. 
Operating and administrative expenses. Good expense control. As Will mentioned, our payroll increased a little bit more than we expected, but with the nice profits, that drives a lot of our incentive compensation both at the store level and at the district and regional level as well. Health care, which was problematic for us in 2009, improved in 2010. It continues to manage very well in the current environment.
Occupancy. As was disclosed in our report, it was up 5.1% for the quarter. The real story there is the energy cost component. We continue to do well on our rent costs. If you look at our actual rent dollars paid, they were up 3% for the quarter -- for second quarter to second quarter on a base of 6.3% more stores. So we continue to manage well through that. I still believe there's opportunities for savings as we go forward, and we continue to work hard on getting after those savings. Fuel dollars spent, as you saw, are up over 50% from year ago, really driven by diesel increases of over $30 and gasoline per gallon cost up mid-30s. That’s [indiscernible] but we're managing through it. We're managing through it well. 
Working capital. I believe we continue to manage that appropriately. If I look at the May, June timeframe, which really drives the sales -- I mean, it drives the accounts receivable at the end of the quarter. We had an extra day. We were down a day in April, but we've gained that day back in May. So our dollars sales in May and June were up 25.5%. Our accounts receivable are up just over 27%. 
A little bit of adder [ph] to that. The postal strike up in Canada added some AR, but that will correct itself. The postal strike will settle by the end of the quarter, and so that will correct itself as we go into July.
Inventory were up 16.5% in the 6-month period. That's quite frankly one we like to see. But we continue to, I believe, manage that well and with the initiatives we have going on driving some of the increase, but we'll work hard to manage that as we go through the tail end of the year. 
We just announced last night, yesterday evening, our third quarter dividend, $0.13 per share. That'll be payable in August. 
And as I close out of my comments and prepare for the questions, I guess the 5 things that stand out for me when I look at the quarter, just to summarize: Number one, “pathway to profit.” The fundamentals of it just work. Number two, very good sales patterns. Number three, very good traction with our sales initiatives. International, national account, manufacturing business, our automated solutions and cutting tools, which is pretty early in the game so it's hard to really assess that at this point, but very good opportunities there. Number four, very good opportunities with private label to help our gross margin over time. And finally, our employees at Fastenal are performing at a high level. And I thank them for their efforts this quarter. 
With that, we'll turn it over to questions."

There's a little disconnect there, and maybe we could improve the crispness on how we disclose that. When we talk about our national accounts, we talk about our sales initiatives, these are initiatives to raise the tide in all of our stores. They’re things that help our stores grow faster, whether that store is the $150,000 a month store down the street here or -- excuse me, over in the middle of Wisconsin or if it's the $40,000 a month store out on the West Coast. It's things that can help raise the tide and give that store manager and district manager more things in their arsenal for growing their business. When we talk about our strategic account stores, that's just a subset of stores, and the reason we carve those out is we like to show the economics of the store model especially when we started the “pathway to profit” because it really allows us a better means to explain it. But the initiatives are not solely in that strategic account stores. They're across all stores. All we're trying to do in that table is show you a peer [ph] look at here is your $60,000 to $100,000 store. Here's your $100,000 to $150,000 store and what their economics look like. And we carved out both our strategic account stores and our overseas stores. But short of that, a sale is a sale, and it goes through any business unit."

And we're working hard to give them, to give the customers better tools, give our people better tools. And our goal is to get that down. We'll probably not get it much below 60 days. It just takes a certain amount of time to do the install. Part of it is they have to bring in clean Internet lines outside of their system. And that's always -- in many cases, it takes 8 weeks just to get the Internet lines. Because the customer doesn't want this running through their IT system. They want a fresh line outside of the plant. There are a lot of details that I'm not familiar with, that I don't know exactly how they work.

If anything, the eastern half of the United States is a little softer than the west. I think a little bit of that is driven by a little uncertainty in the auto industry or there was some uncertainty there for late May and some of that. Overall, the entire business did well. International did exceptionally well. It grew at about almost 50%. Regionally, there was no one that was doing great. Some of the areas like the Southwest, the oil belt down there has cooled off a little bit. They're still ahead of the company, but in the first quarter, they were well ahead of the company. So that softened up a little bit. Midwest remained strong. And I think a lot of that is being driven by optimism in the ag industry, and a lot of the agricultural business is doing really well with $7 corn. Any other -- I looked at the numbers close.

I think being willing to look objectively at everything you do and assessing everything you do every day is a healthy thing for a business.

It might be a market that I had 3 stores. I went to 4. I have a lease coming due in one of the stores, and I think I could serve the market better with 3 than 4. And in an environment where I have all the things in my arsenal, including vending, that might be a better solution. When I look at cumulatively how many we've closed over a 40-year period, the number is inconsequential.” So I think it's a healthy way to look at your business everyday of saying, what do I do to make my business better in this market, in this district, in this region.

Dan and I are both going to give brief comments, and we're going to open it up for questions. I'd like to start by saying I think we had another good quarter. Our sales came in at 20.4% for the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're at 22%. For the third quarter, we were a little lower than the first 2 quarters, but we are still above the sequential trends. Our historical sequential trends we're very optimistic about that. Our Manufacturing customers, as we stated, grew at 18.3% as compared to 18.5% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter. So there has not been a lot of change. If anything, it remain strong, and so we're very optimistic about that. Non-Residential Construction grew at 15.8% in the second quarter, the same as the second quarter and that's an area that there isn't a tremendous amount of activity. Most of that's coming in energy jobs at larger construction jobs and infrastructure but we don't see much as you drive around and this tower cranes and things like that. So I think our team's doing a nice job taking it out where they can. 
So overall, the sales trends are good, and we remain optimistic in somewhat of an uncertain time. We don't have a tremendous amount of visibility, but the anecdotal stuff that we're getting from our people in the field is still quite positive, although there are a few signs of things slowing a little bit. But for the most part, it's very positive. 
On the earnings growth, we grew our earnings at 29.1%, very good number. It's interesting though about perspective I'm looking at it and going we didn't even grow 30% because we've had something around 29% is still a strong number. I feel very good about our expense control. I think the team did a nice job. We picked up 140 basis points of pretax earnings over last year. 
Our goal of 'pathway to profit' is to pick up 100 points so we've been able to exceed that goal, and I really feel good about the job the team did on controlling the expenses. Pretax profit at 21.4% of sales. That's a record, and net income north of 13.3%. That's a number I think we can also be proud of. There's only been I think last quarter the only time we ever exceeded 13% on a net income basis. 
Switching gears, talk about store openings a little bit. Our store openings came in lower than we had earlier planned and thought we would earlier in the year. But I'm not overly concerned with this because at this point, I'd rather see if we can only get so many things done with, which is really the case, I'd rather see that our people put more energy into our automated supplier vending solutions because it's more timely. Our competitors are not out opening stores in the markets that we plan to open in the future, but they are talking about Automated Supply and vending. So I think the faster we can move that project along, long term, that will be better long-term strategic decision, and the store openings and the opportunities will probably be there in the future. I believe we'll be there in the future. So we're working very hard on the Automated Supply. 
Talking about Automated Supply, I stated to anyone who would listen I think that I thought we could do or wanted to do 2,500 signings in the second quarter or excuse me, the third quarter. We fell short of that we came in at 2,260. So I was disappointed with that, but when I looked at the 2,260, and I compare to where I thought we would be a year ago it's a great number. And by any other measure, it's a very good number, but we're going to continue to push hard. What really happened is we dug a hole for ourselves in July. We didn't have a very good month of signings in July. We got behind in the first holiday week and never made it up for the rest of the quarter. 
On a very positive note, the team did a great job on the installations. We set up, we installed and turned on more than 1,700 machines in the quarter and that's just a lot of hard work pouring into those customers setting it up and getting these machines up and running. And I like the signings, but the install's really where the revenue starts, and so that's a positive. 
As Dan noted in the release, the overall sales growth, year-over-year sales growth of the customers that have implemented vending Automated Supply remains strong at 49%, it's been 49%, right at 49% each quarter, and so that's a very positive note. We just need more customers to have Automated Supply is kind of what we're thinking. 
Other initiatives that we've talked a lot about our Government sales initiatives continues to do well. We had very strong sequential growth in the state and local business. Most of our Government business that we're focusing on is state and local business at this point. In the future, we would look at doing more federal, but right now, our focus is state and local. We think with our branch network, we're better positioned for that type of business, and so far, it's proving to be correct. 
On the metalworking initiative that we talked about, we feel very good about where we are. We've had a lot of product in our distribution system. That's part of our inventory growth. We continue to work in signing up strategic partners, partners we need to fill out our product line, and that's gone very well. And we had said that we're going to put in 42 trained specialists. We have 37 in place, and 34 of them have gotten through our level 2 training, which is a training designed by an outside firm again, working with our suppliers. And it's a very intense training. Our people are coming back with great feedback. So we're nearly hope to see the results of this effort probably late, well, probably in the late in the first quarter into the second quarter of next year, and these people are out selling now. Start gaining some traction and start seeing the results in 2012, but we're very optimistic. 
We met with our product development lead yesterday, and he gave us an update and things seem to be moving in the direction that we had planned for them to move. On the first side, we continue to invest in people. I believe this will flatten out in the fourth quarter really due to normal seasonal slowdown that we see in our business. The majority of our efforts go into the sales efforts on the administrative and warehouse side where we've added more people. 
If you notice that, our Manufacturing business is doing very well, and we've added more people in there. And on the administrative side, most of those additions have been people that we put in to help push the vending systems. So it's really more of a sales service efforts, people setting up the machines and those things. And I'm really proud of as a leader, I'm proud of the fact that Fastenal's in a position to be adding employees. When you listen to the news and you see the slow economy and all the things that are going on and I tell our employees this I think we should be very proud of the fact we've added about 2,000 great opportunities this year to people out and trying to push the economy forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and he'll make a few comments, and we'll open it up for questions."

First off, sales trends continue exceed our benchmark trend line. If you look at history, history would indicate that we should be at about 16% growth from our daily average in January to our daily average in September. This year, we're actually up 20.8%. So we're running about 5 points ahead of that trend line, which has given us nice launching pad as we go onto 2012. 
Digging a lot deeper into the release, one thing I wanted to add on the end market trends Will touched already is we've been a situation where the ISM index has been moderating now for about 5 months, and we continue to perform well. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we think our vending and our international is helping giving a nice boost to this, but our domestic, our North American business is doing just fine in and of itself. 
On the Non-Residential side, Will touched on some of the energy projects that we're supplying into. I think at the end of the day, it's that and it's the fact that our store employees are just resourceful at turning over stones to find business. We're really well positioned to go after a lot of the small projects that a lot of other companies either aren't as aggressive with or aren't as interested in going after in our stores sale on smaller projects all day long, and that's really a lot of little dollars are really what's driving our Non-Residential Construction. 
The vending stats. I'll touch on a few things that Will mentioned as well, but I guess the 2 things the that jumps out for me when we were pooling together the earnings release was the fivefold increase in the number of installs from Q3 2010 to Q3 2011. And my comments there would be nice job to Russ and his team in ramping up not just what we're doing to promote vending, but what we're doing to install because Will is right. The revenue starts after the machine is installed, not as the contract is signed. 
The other item is taking a step back and thinking for a second 13% of our sales now going to customers that have vending as part of their operation, and that customer base is growing at 50%, basically 50% and to me the part that's most meaningful there is the fact that this is a generally Manufacturing customer base. It's medium-sized customer. It's not small customers or large customers. It's been driven by a broad brush, but the dollars to move the needle on those kind of dollars and the way we're moving it is quite staggering. And the fact that this business becomes very sticky because we're really providing a better solution than the competitor down the street. 
'Pathway to profit' on Page 7 of the release, we've hit a new high on the average store size. 83,000 a month. Our previous high was in third quarter of 2008 when we were at 82,000, and it's no coincidence that our record high for pretax earnings is this quarter because of 'pathway to profit,' the mechanics and the fundamentals of it are just kicking in as we've seen in prior quarters. The -- if I look through some of the mix of employees, our store is up about 16% on a year-over-year basis. Since we started the 'pathway to profit,' we've added 35% more employees on an FTE basis into our store. 
On the non-store selling side, we've added 44 people in the last 12 months. We've added 49 -- 44% in the last 12 months, 49% since the first quarter of 2007 so you can really see the energy that's being invested into the growth drivers of our business over the last 12 months. And both of the types of things that are driving that are driving Government that are driving our State Manufacturing business. 
On the PC side, up about 7, 16.7%. Since we started the 'pathway to profit' we're up 19.5% FTE. 5 points of that came from the Holcomb acquisition. So we've done a nice job of leveraging that side of the business over the last -- since 2007 and believe we have the ability to keep leveraging that into the future. 
And then finally, as Will touched on, on the support side, we've added about 11.7% in the last year. A good meaningful piece of that is centered on back-office support for our initiatives. But since 2007, we've added 5.7% more people, but we have 42.5% more sales dollars flowing through our stores to maintain back 2007. All of that really promotes 'pathway to profit' leverage and the improvement profitability of the business. 
On Page 9, there's few [ph] paragraphs. We talk a bit about gross profit margin. Bottom line, I'd say there's a lot of noise in the numbers right now. We're kind of in the middle of that 51, 53 zone we've always said. We still look optimistically at that number as we go forward because some of the things we talked about on our second quarter call, opportunities with our exclusive brands, opportunities are enhanced with our vending because they really go hand-in-hand. We really see over the upcoming quarters our ability to move that gross margin north and enhance the operating leverage of the business. So we're optimistic. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. 
One of the thing that probably we don't talk about enough is the fact that with the strong growth in our large OEM business, both domestically and internationally, that puts quite a dampening effect on our gross margin. It doesn't hurt our operating margin at all because operating margin business, but it has put a dampening effect on gross margin. So if anything, if you compare gross margin to a year or 2 ago, it's probably a bit understated in that regard. But with that said, the number is what it is, and we believe we have the growth drivers to move that number north in the future. 
On the operating administrative expense side, our payroll increased about 17 4 [ph] and you see a dynamic going on through the numbers now whereas last year our quarterly number was quite a bit higher growth than our year-to-date number because we were in the pattern of bonuses and rising. Now we're in a situation where we're anniversary-ing some of those higher bonus numbers from a year ago, and that's why you're really seeing that payroll growth moderating quite dramatically because we're getting back to the point of growth for activity growth rather than moving out of easier comparison. And so while our growth is our net earnings or slightly below 30, it's a powerful statement because we had a pretty good third quarter last year. 
The final item I'll touch on working capital. We continue I believe to manage it well. We still believe we have opportunities in inventory to keep tightening that and tightening that. But all things considered, I think we're operating that well, and most of you probably saw this last night but we announced our fourth quarter dividend or our third quarter dividend payable in fourth quarter $0.14 that we paid out here in November. 
With that, I will take some questions, and we'll go from there."

I mean, if there are low-margin customer we might be up or we might be down, but the trend is certainly the customer margin changes very little when we add vending. The sales just go up, and it really I think has to do more with the pricing habits of our stores. The store looks at this customer in many cases, they were a customer in the past. So the store looks at the customer and they have 40% margin customer. When they've been to vending product, they're probably in that range because it's just incremental business for the store. So it's actually very consistent. I've spent some time looking at it. I wish it was higher, but it's not. Now the opportunity we have is we put in more Fastenal exclusive brands in those machines, we will see margin improvement.

And fewer employees than the organization in general because of the moderating ISM. We're very decentralized, and we try to share a lot of information with our regional and district leaders about what we're seeing. And with the moderating ISM, our folks pay attention. They're smart business people. They know not to get ahead of themselves, and so we're working collectively to where we need it because we don't want to hamper our growth. On the flip side, you be careful not to get ahead of yourself on certain things when there's uncertainty when you look out the next 6 to 12 months. As far as some of the other expenses, if I look at occupancy, about 1 point I think it's 1.3% of our -- we grew at about 8.5%. 1.3 points of that came just from vending, and the other one thing that did pop our occupancy up a little bit more than I expected is energy prices are meaningfully higher than they were a year ago. And I don't know how it was nationwide, but we have some more normal here in third quarter probably more cooling than we normally had. And but still looked at our occupancy in general that we still have legs on that. When I look out to 2012, we typically will have 600 to 700 leases up for renewal any given year, and one thing that you still have is there's still empty spaces out there. And there's also willingness on the part of the real estate community, if you will. I mean, if you look at the value of money and borrowing cost or incremental borrowing costs, the need for a 10% return on real estate that you might have seen 5 years ago, people are willing to take a little return A, to keep the building occupying and B, because their costs have gone down in many cases or they'll also use that cash probably better way to say it isn't as attractive as it might as been 4 or 5 years ago."

We're actually launching some new initiatives kind of stirring the pot, believing we can do better on transportation, turn it into a meaningful profit center over the next 2 years, and you'll hear more about that because that's kind of my path. So we have some good initiatives going there. A couple of other things I noticed as far as how do you pull expenses back. Maybe just not grow them as fast if you look at 2012 or '11, we built the machine behind the machine, the vending group, which is well over 150 people. That group was in place, and we believe that they can do well over 1,000 machines both sell and install at their current levels, so we have headroom per month, excuse me. Government sales to put that in place this year. We're really not seeing the benefits yet we have nice growth but not big dollars. Our metalworking team we spent a lot of money there putting these people and training them. And our District Managers and regional vice presidents, we won't be adding many because of the lower store count. So if you look at this group, these are higher paid individuals and also in that group, we have international accounts group. We've over invested in the last 12 months in all of these groups. The real benefits will come in 2012, and we don't -- we'll continue to invest but not even close to the level that we did in 2011, and we should the benefits of that and drive our incremental profits."

We added some inventory early on because we wanted to have products ready on the shelf. We have a backlog of machine. So we are ready to handle it from the standpoint of that product, if we end up having a few months too much because we over stretched ourselves, that product's great product shelf life and but the cost of running up is too high, and so a little bit of our inventory, a little bit of our CapEx is there because we were willing to front load because we saw the potential in the opportunity here. With that, I'm going to cut off the call. We're at 45 minutes past the hour. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining in the call this morning. Just a couple of takeaway items I jotted down during the call. Probably sound like a track record here but maybe in today's world, sometimes hearing the same things from a company consecutive quarters is a sign of good things rather than being boring. But first off, our 'pathway to profit,' we're more convinced than ever that it just works. It's a logical profession for our business, and it's working well throughout the organization. Very good sales patterns. One thing that I noted the other day when I was looking at some of the numbers, if I look at the last 6 months, so the second, third quarter of this year on a 2-year comparison, our growth is in excess of 45% every month. We had actually one  month over 50%. I have to go back at 2006 to see that type of a 2-year comparison, and 2006  was a pretty 'pathway to profit'. So we were opening stores at about 14% clip. So what that demonstrates to me is with focus, with energy and about bunch of growth drivers, we can continue to take market share at very aggressive fashion in this marketplace, and it isn't strictly store centered. It's all facets of the business. The sales initiatives. We have great traction with them. Very good opportunity with our exclusive brands, and finally, as I mentioned last quarter, the employees of Fastenal continue to perform at a very high level. Thank you to them whoever's on the call. Have a good day, everybody."

Dan and I are going to both give some brief comments, and we're going to open it up for questions. I'd like to start by saying I think we had another good quarter. Our sales came in at 20.4% for the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're at 22%. For the third quarter, we were a little lower than the first 2 quarters, but we're still above the sequential trend -- our historical sequential trends. We're very optimistic about that. Our Manufacturing customers, as we stated, grew at 18.3% as compared to 18.5% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter. So there has not been a lot of change, or if anything, it's remained strong. So we're very optimistic about that. Non-Residential Construction grew at 15.8%, the same as the second quarter, and that's an area that there isn't a tremendous amount of activity. Most of that's coming in energy jobs and larger construction jobs in infrastructure, but you don't see much as you drive around in these tower cranes and things like that. So I think our team's doing a nice job taking it out wherever they can. 
So overall, the sales trends are good, and we remain optimistic in somewhat of an uncertain time. We don't have a tremendous amount of visibility, but the anecdotal stuff that we're getting from our people in the field is still quite positive, although there are a few signs of things slowing a little bit. But for the most part, it's very positive. 
On the earnings growth, we grew our earnings at 29.1% -- very good number. It's interesting to know of our perspective. I was looking at it going forward . We didn't even grow over 30% because we've had something that run 29%, it's still a strong number. 
I feel very good about our expense control. I think the team did a nice job. We picked up 140 basis points of pretax earnings over the last year. Our goal of 'pathway to profit' is to pick up 100 points, so we've been able to exceed that goal. And I really feel good about the job the team did on controlling the expenses. 
Pretax profit at 21.4% of sales. That's a record. And net income, north of 13% at 13.3%. That's a number I think we can also be proud of. There's only been -- I think the last quarter is the only time we've ever exceeded 13% on a net income basis. 
Switching gears, talk about store openings a little bit. Our store openings came in lower than we had earlier -- that we had planned and thought we would earlier in the year. But I'm not overly concerned with this because at this point, I'd rather see -- if we can only get so many things done, which is really the case, I'd rather see that our people put more energy into our Automated Supply, our vending solutions, because it's more timely. Our competitors are not out opening stores in the markets that we plan to open in the future, but they are talking about Automated Supply and vending. So I think the faster we can move that project along, long term, that will be a better long-term strategic decision, and the store openings and the opportunities will probably be there in the future -- I believe will be there in the future. So we're working very hard on the Automated Supply. 
Talking about Automated Supply, I stated to anyone who would listen I think that I thought we could do or wanted to do 2,500 signings in the second quarter -- or, excuse me, in the third quarter. We fell short of that. We came in at 2,260. So I was disappointed with that. But when I looked at the 2,260 and I compared it to where I thought we would be a year ago, it's a great number, and by any other measure, it's a very good number. But we're going to continue to push hard. What really happened is we dug a hole for ourselves in July. We didn't have a very good month of signings in July. We got behind in the first holiday week and never made it up for the rest of the quarter. 
On a very positive note, the team did a great job on the installations. We set up or we installed and turned on more than 1,700 machines in the quarter, and that's just a lot of hard work going into those customers, setting it up and getting these machines up and running. And I like the signings with the installs. It's really where the revenue starts, and so that's a positive. 
As Dan noted in the release, the overall sales growth, our year-over-year sales growth, of the customers who'd have implemented vending Automated Supply remains strong at 49%. It's been 49%, right at 49% each quarter. And so that's a very positive note. We just need more customers to have Automated Supply, as kind of what we're thinking. 
Other initiatives that we've talked a lot about. Our Government sales initiatives continues to do well. We had very strong sequential growth into the state and local business. Most of our Government business that we're focusing on is state and local business at this point. In the future, we would look at doing more federal, but right now, our focus is state and local. We think with our branch network, we're better positioned for that type of business. And so far, it's proving to be correct. 
On the metalworking initiative that we talked about, we feel very good about where we are. We have added a lot of product into our distribution system. That's part of our inventory growth. We continue to work at signing up strategic partners, the partners we need to fill out our product line, and that's gone very well. And we had said that we're going to put in 42 trained specialists. We have 37 in place, and 34 of them have gotten through our level 2 training, which is a training designed by an outside firm, again, working with our suppliers. And it's a very intense training. Our people are coming back with great feedback. So we're nearly hope to see the results of this effort probably late, well, probably late in the first quarter into the second quarter of next year. These people are out selling now. Start gaining some traction and start seeing the results into 2012, but we're very optimistic. 
We met with our product development lead yesterday, and he gave us an update and the things seem to be moving in the direction that we had planned for them to move. On the first in our slide, [ph] we have continued to invest in people. I believe this was flatten out in the fourth quarter really due to normal seasonal slowdown that we see in our business. The majority of our efforts go into the sales effort on the administrative and warehouse side, where we've added more people. 
Please notice that our Manufacturing business is doing very well, and we've added more people in there. And on the administrative side, most of those additions have been people that we put in to help push the vending systems. So it's really more about sales service effort, the people setting up the machines and those things. And I'm really proud of this. As a leader, I'm proud of the fact that Fastenal is in a position to be adding employees. When you listen to the news and you see the slow economy and all the things that are going on, and I tell our employees there's -- I think we should be very proud of the fact we've added about 2,000 great opportunities this year to people out and trying to push the economy forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and he'll make a few comments, and we'll open it up for questions."

First off, sales trends continue to follow or exceed our benchmark trend line. If you look at history, history would indicate that we should be at about 16% growth from our daily average in January to our daily average in September. This year, we're actually up 20.8%. So we're running about 5 points ahead of that trend line, which has given us nice launching pad as we go into 2012. 
Digging a lot deeper into the release, the one thing I wanted to add on in market trends -- Will touched them already -- is that we've been a situation where the ISM index has been moderating now for about 5 months, and we continue to perform well. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we really think our vending and our international is helping giving a nice boost to this, but our domestic, our North American business is doing just fine in and of  itself. 
On the Non-Residential side, Will touched on some of the energy projects that we're supplying into. I think at the end of the day, it's that and it's the fact that our store employees are just resourceful at turning over stones to find business. We're really well positioned to go after a lot of the small projects that a lot of other companies either aren't as aggressive with or aren't as interested in going after. In our stores, sale on smaller projects all day long, and that's really a lot of little dollars are really what's driving our Non-Residential Construction. 
The vending stats. I'll touch on a few things that Will mentioned as well, but I guess the 2 things that jumped out for me when we were pooling together the earnings release was the fivefold increase in the number of installs from Q3 2010 to Q3 2011. And my comments there would be nice job to Russ and his team in ramping up not just what we're doing to promote vending, but what we're doing to install. Because Will is right. The revenue starts after the machine is installed, not after the contract is signed. 
The other item is taking a step back and thinking for a second. 13% of our sales now going to customers that have vending as part of their operation, and that customer base is growing at basically 50%. And to me the part that's most meaningful there is the fact that this is a generally Manufacturing customer base. It's medium-sized customer. It's not small customers or large customers. It's been driven by a broad brush, but the dollars to move the needle on those kind of dollars and the way we're moving it is quite staggering. And the fact that this business becomes very sticky because we're really providing a better solution than the competitor down the street. 
'Pathway to profit' on Page 7 of the release, we've hit a new high on the average store size -- 83,000 a month. Our previous high was in third quarter of 2008 when we were at 82,000, and it's no coincidence that our record high for pretax earnings is this quarter because the 'pathway to profit,' the mechanics and the fundamentals of it are just kicking in, as we've seen in prior quarters. The -- if I look through some of the mix of employees, our store FTE is up about 16% on a year-over-year basis. Since we started the 'pathway to profit,' we've added 35% more employees on an FTE basis into our store. 
On the non-store selling side, we've added 44 people in the last 12 months. We've added 49 -- 44% in the last 12 months, 49% since the first quarter of 2007. So you can really see the energy that's being invested into the growth drivers of our business over the last 12 months. And those are the types of things that are driving the vending, that are driving Government, that are driving our strength in Manufacturing business. 
On the BC [ph] side, up about 7 -- 16.7%. since we started the 'pathway to profit' we're up 19.5% FTE. 5 points of that came from the Holo-Krome acquisition. So we've done a nice job of leveraging that side of the business over the last -- since 2007. And I believe we have the ability to keep leveraging that into the future. 
And then finally, as Will touched on, on the support side, we've added about 11.7% in the last year. A good meaningful piece of that is centered on back-office support for our initiatives. But since 2007, we've added 5.7% more people, but we have 42.5% more sales dollars flowing through our stores today than what we did back in 2007. All of that really promotes the 'pathway to profit' leverage and the improvement profitability of the business. 
On Page 9, there's few paragraphs. We talked a bit about gross profit margin. Bottom line, I'd say there's a lot of noise in the numbers right now. We're kind of in the middle of that 51, 53 zone we've always said. We still look optimistically at that number as we go forward because some of the things we talked about on our second quarter call, opportunities with our exclusive brands, how those opportunities are enhanced with our vending because they really go hand-in-hand. We really see over the upcoming quarters our ability to move that gross margin north and enhance the operating leverage of the business. So we're optimistic. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. 
One of the thing that probably we don't talk about enough is the fact that with the strong growth in our large OEM business, both domestically and internationally, that puts quite a dampening effect on our gross margin. It doesn't hurt our operating margin at all because it's attractive operating margin business. But it has put a dampening effect on gross margin. So if anything, if you compare our gross margin to a year or 2 ago, it's probably a bit understated in that regard. But with that said, the number is what it is, and we believe we have the growth drivers to move that number north in the future. 
On the operating administrative expense side, our payroll increased about 17.4% and you see a dynamic going through the numbers now. Whereas last year, our quarterly number was quite a bit higher growth  than our year-to-date number because we were in the pattern of bonuses in rising. Now we're in a situation where we're anniversarying some of those higher bonus numbers from a year ago, and that's why you're really seeing that payroll growth moderating quite dramatically because we're getting back to the point of growth for activity growth rather than moving out of easier comparison. So while our growth is -- our net earnings are slightly below 30%, it's a powerful statement because we had a pretty good third quarter last year. 
The final item I'll touch on. Our working capital, we continue, I believe, to manage it well. We still believe we have opportunities in the inventory to keep tightening that and tightening that. But all things considered, I think we're operating that well, and most of you probably saw this last night, but we announced our fourth quarter dividend -- or our third quarter dividend payable in fourth quarter, $0.14, and that we paid out here in November. 
With that, I will take some questions, and we'll go from there."

What I really do as I look at the customer last year and this year and even with the growth in margin in most cases hasn't moved much. I mean, if there are low-margin customer, we might be up or we might be down, but the trend is basically the customer margin changes very little when we add vending. The sales just go up. And it really I think has to do more with the pricing habits of our stores. So store looks at this customer, in many cases, they were a customer in the past. So the store looks at the customer and they have a 40% margin customer. When they've bid the vending product, they're probably bidding it in that range because it's just incremental business for the store. So it's actually very consistent. I've spent some time looking at it. I wish it was higher, but it's not. Now the opportunity we have is we put in more Fastenal exclusive brands in those machines, we will see a margin improvement.

And fewer employees than the organization in general because of the moderating ISM. We're very decentralized, and we try to share a lot of information with our regional and district leaders about what we're seeing. And with the moderating ISM, our folks pay attention. They're smart business people. They know not to get ahead of themselves. And so we're working diligently to staff-stack [ph] where we need it. We don't want to hamper our growth. On the flip side, you'd be careful not to get ahead of yourself on certain things when there's uncertainty when you look out the next 6 to 12 months. As far as some of the other expenses, if I look at occupancy, about 1 point, I think it's 1.3% of our -- we grew at about 8.5%. 1.3 points of that came just from vending. And one thing that did pop our occupancy up a little bit more than I expected is energy prices are meaningfully higher than they were a year ago. And I don't know how it was nationwide, but we have some more normal here in third quarter so we probably be more cooling than we normally had. But still look at our occupancy in general, we still have legs on that. When I look out to 2012, we typically will have 600 to 700 leases up for renewal in a given year, and one thing that you still have is there's still empty spaces out there. And there's also willingness on the part of the real estate community, if you will. I mean, if you look at the value of money and borrowing cost or incremental borrowing costs, the need for a 10% return on real estate that you might have seen 5 years ago, people are willing to take a little return, a, to keep the building occupied, and b, because their costs have gone down in many cases, or they'll also use that cash, probably a better way to say it, isn't as attractive as it might as been 4 or 5 years ago."

Now that diesel and gasoline prices are coming down over the last 4 to 6 weeks. Going forward, we think we'll be in a good position in product movement. We're actually launching some new initiatives kind of stirring the pot, believing we can do better on transportation, turn it into a meaningful profit center over the next 2 years, and you'll hear more about that because that's kind of my path. So we have some good initiatives going there. A couple of other things I noticed as far as how do you pull expenses back. Maybe just not grow them as fast. If you look at 2012 or '11, we built the machine behind the machine, the vending group, which is well over 150 people. That group was in place, and we believe that they can do well over 1,000 machines both sell and install at their current levels, so we have some built-in headroom per month -- excuse me, yes. Government sales, we put that in place this year. We're really not seeing the benefits yet. We have nice growth but not big dollars. Our metalworking team, we spent a lot of money there putting these people and then training them. And our district managers and regional vice presidents, we won't be adding many because of the lower store counts. So if you look at this group, these are higher paid individuals. And also in that group, you'd put our international accounts group. We've over-invested in the last 12 months in all of these groups. The real benefits will come in 2012, and we don't -- we'll continue to invest but not at even close to the level that we did in 2011, and we should really see the benefits of that and drive our incremental profits."

I'm saying upcoming quarters -- to double that. And that is very attractive from the opportunity not only to go after business that maybe you won't go after before because the margin wasn't attractive enough. Or to enhance your margins so you can use it to grow a little faster or you can use it to drive some gross margin. We believe there is ample opportunity for both.

But message to both our purchasing group, as well as our vending group is don't get caught naked here. We added some inventory early on because we wanted to have vendable products ready on the shelf. We have a backlog of machines. So we are ready to handle it from the standpoint of that product, if we end up having a few months too much because we over stretched ourselves, that product's a great product without a shelf life. But the cost of running up is too high, and so a little bit of our inventory, a little bit of our CapEx is there because we were willing to front load because we saw the potential in the opportunity here. With that, I'm going to cut off the call. We're at 45 minutes past the hour. And again, I want to thank everybody for joining in the call this morning. Just a couple of takeaway items I jotted down during the call. I probably sound like a stuck record here, but maybe in today's world, sometimes hearing the same thing from a company in consecutive quarters is a sign of good things rather than being boring. But first off, our 'pathway to profit,' we're more convinced than ever that it just works. It's a logical profession  for our business, and it's working well throughout the organization. Very good sales patterns. One thing that I noted the other day when I was looking at some of the numbers, if I look at the last 6 months, so the second, third quarter of this year, on a 2-year comparison, our growth is in excess of 45% every month. We had actually one  month over 50%. I have to go back at 2006 to see that type of a 2-year comparison. And 2006  was a pretty 'pathway to profit'. So we were opening stores at about 14% clip. So what that demonstrates to me is with focus, with energy and about bunch of growth drivers, we can continue to take market share at a very aggressive fashion in this marketplace, and it isn't strictly store centered. It's all facets of the business. The sales initiatives, we have great traction with them. Very good opportunity with our exclusive brands, and finally, as I mentioned last quarter, the employees at Fastenal continue to perform at a very high level. Thank you to them whoever's on the call. Have a good day, everybody."

Dan and I are going to both give some brief comments, and we're going to open it up for questions. I'd like to start by saying I think we had another good quarter. Our sales came in at 20.4% for the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're at 22%. For the third quarter, we were a little lower than the first 2 quarters, but we're still above the sequential trend -- our historical sequential trends. We're very optimistic about that. Our Manufacturing customers, as we stated, grew at 18.3% as compared to 18.5% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter. So there has not been a lot of change, but if anything, it's remained strong. So we're very optimistic about that. Non-Residential Construction grew at 15.8%, the same as the second quarter, and that's an area that there isn't a tremendous amount of activity. Most of that's coming in energy jobs and larger construction jobs in infrastructure, but you don't see much as you drive around in these tower cranes and things like that. So I think our team's doing a nice job digging it out wherever they can. 
So overall, the sales trends are good, and we remain optimistic in somewhat of an uncertain time. We don't have a tremendous amount of visibility, but the anecdotal stuff that we're getting from our people in the field is still quite positive, although there are a few signs of things slowing a little bit. But for the most part, it's very positive. 
On the earnings growth, we grew our earnings at 29.1%. Very good number. It's interesting though about perspective. I was looking at it going, boy, we didn't even grow over 30%. Because we've had such a good run 29%, it's still a strong number. 
I feel very good about our expense control. I think that the team did a nice job. We picked up 140 basis points of pretax earnings over last year. Our goal of 'pathway to profit' is to pick up 100 points, so we've been able to exceed that goal. And I really feel good about the job the team did on controlling the expenses. 
Pretax profit at 21.4% of sales. That's a record. And net income, north of 13% at 13.3%. That's a number I think we can also be proud of. There's only been -- I think last quarter is the only time we've ever exceeded 13% on a net income basis. 
Switching gears, talk about store openings a little bit. Our store openings came in lower than we had earlier -- than we had planned and thought we would earlier in the year. But I'm not overly concerned with this because at this point, I'd rather see -- if we can only get so many things done, which is really the case, I'd rather see that our people put more energy into our Automated Supply, our vending solutions, because it's more timely. Our competitors are not out opening stores in the markets that we plan to open in the future, but they are talking about Automated Supply and vending. So I think the faster we can move that project along, long term, that will be a better long-term strategic decision, and the store openings and the opportunities will probably be there in the future -- I believe will be there in the future. So we're working very hard on the Automated Supply. 
Talking about Automated Supply, I stated to anyone who would listen I think that I thought we could do or wanted to do 2,500 signings in the second quarter -- or, excuse me, in the third quarter. We fell short of that. We came in at 2,260. So I was disappointed with that. But when I look at the 2,260 and I compare it to where I thought we would be a year ago, it's a great number, and by any other measure, it's a very good number. But we're going to continue to push hard. What really happened is we dug a hole for ourselves in July. We didn't have a very good month of signings in July. We got behind in the first holiday week and never made it up for the rest of the quarter. 
On a very positive note, the team did a great job on the installations. We set up or we installed and turned on more than 1,700 machines in the quarter, and that's just a lot of hard work going into those customers, setting it up and getting these machines up and running. And I like the signings with the installs. It's really where the revenue starts, and so that's a positive. 
As Dan noted in the release, the overall sales growth, our year-over-year sales growth of the customers that have implemented vending Automated Supply remains strong at 49%. It's been 49%, right at 49% each quarter. And so that's a very positive note. We just need more customers to have Automated Supply, is kind of what we're thinking. 
Other initiatives that we've talked a lot about. Our Government sales initiative continues to do well. We had very strong sequential growth into the state and local business. Most of our Government business that we're focusing on is state and local business at this point. In the future, we would look at doing more federal, but right now, our focus is state and local. We think with our branch network, we're better positioned for that type of business. And so far, it's proving to be correct. 
On the metalworking initiative that we talked about, we feel very good about where we are. We have added a lot of product into our distribution system. That's part of our inventory growth. We continue to work at signing up strategic partners, the partners we need to fill out our product line, and that's gone very well. And we had said that we're going to put in 42 trained specialists. We have 37 in place, and 34 of them have gotten through our level 2 training, which is a training designed by an outside firm, again, working with our suppliers. And it's a very intense training. Our people are coming back with great feedback. So we really hope to see the results of this effort probably late, well, probably late in the first quarter into the second quarter of next year. These people are out selling now. Start gaining some traction and start seeing the results into 2012, but we're very optimistic. 
We met with our product development lead yesterday, and he gave us an update and the things seem to be moving in the direction that we had planned for them to move. On the personnel side, we have continued to invest in people. I believe this was flatten out in the fourth quarter really due to normal seasonal slowdown that we see in our business. The majority of our efforts go into the sales effort on the administrative and warehouse side, where we've added more people, if you've noticed that. 
Our Manufacturing business is doing very well, and we've added more people in there. And on the administrative side, most of those additions have been people that we put in to help push the vending systems. So it's really more about sales service effort, the people setting up the machines and those things. And I'm really proud of this. As a leader, I'm proud of the fact that Fastenal is in a position to be adding employees. When you listen to the news and you see the slow economy and all the things that are going on, and I tell our employees this, I think we should be very proud of the fact we've added about 2,000 great opportunities this year to people out and trying to push the economy forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and he'll make a few comments, and we'll open it up for questions."
270747,141352109,172390,"Fastenal Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2011",2011-10-13,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. Reiterate a few things that Will touched on. First off, sales trends continue to follow or exceed our benchmark trend line. If you look at history, history would indicate that",1264,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. Reiterate a few things that Will touched on. First off, sales trends continue to follow or exceed our benchmark trend line. If you look at history, history would indicate that we should be at about 16% growth from our daily average in January to our daily average in September. This year, we're actually up 20.8%. So we're running about 5 points ahead of that trend line, which has given us nice launching pad as we go into 2012. 
Digging a lot deeper into the release, one thing I wanted to add on the end-market trends -- Will touched them already -- is that we've been in a situation where the ISM index has been moderating now for about 5 months, and we continue to perform well. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we really think our vending and our international is helping giving a nice boost to this, but our domestic, our North American business is doing just fine in and of itself. 
On the Non-Residential side, Will touched on some of the energy projects that we're supplying into. I think at the end of the day, it's that and it's the fact that our store employees are just resourceful at turning over stones to find business. We're really well positioned to go after a lot of the small projects that a lot of other companies either aren't as aggressive with or aren't as interested in going after. And our stores sell on smaller projects all day long, and that's really a lot of little dollars are really what's driving our Non-Residential Construction. 
The vending stats. I'll touch on a few things that Will mentioned as well, but I guess the 2 things that jumped out for me when we were pooling together the earnings release was the fivefold increase in the number of installs from Q3 2010 to Q3 2011. And my comments there would be nice job to Russ and his team in ramping up not just what we're doing to promote vending, but what we're doing to install. Because Will is right. The revenue starts after the machine is installed, not after the contract is signed. 
The other item is taking a step back and thinking for a second. 13% of our sales now going to customers that have vending as part of their operation, and that customer base is growing at basically 50%. And to me the part that's most meaningful there is the fact that this is a predominantly Manufacturing customer base. It's medium-sized customers. It's not small customers or large customers. It's been driven by a broad brush, but the dollars to move the needle on those kind of dollars and the way we're moving it is quite staggering. And the fact that this business becomes very sticky because we're really providing a better solution than the competitor down the street. 
'Pathway to profit' on Page 7 of the release, we've hit a new high on the average store size, 83,000 a month. Our previous high was in third quarter of 2008 when we were at 82,000, and it's no coincidence that our record high for pretax earnings is this quarter because the 'pathway to profit,' the mechanics and the fundamentals of it are just kicking in, as we've seen in prior quarters. The -- if I look through some of the mix of employees, our store FTE is up about 16% on a year-over-year basis. Since we started the 'pathway to profit,' we've added 35% more employees on an FTE basis into our store. 
On the non-store selling side, we've added 44 people in the last 12 months. We've added 49 -- 44% in the last 12 months, 49% since the first quarter of 2007. So you can really see the energy that's being invested into the growth drivers of our business over the last 12 months. And those are the types of things that are driving the vending, that are driving the Government, that are driving our strength in Manufacturing business. 
On the BC [ph] side, up about 7 -- 16.7%. since we started the 'pathway to profit' we're up 19.5% FTE. 5 points of that came from the Holo-Krome acquisition. So we've done a nice job of leveraging that side of the business over the last -- since 2007. And I believe we have the ability to keep leveraging that into the future. 
And then finally, as Will touched on, on the support side, we've added about 11.7% in the last year. A good meaningful piece of that is centered on back-office support for our initiatives. But since 2007, we've added 5.7% more people, but we have 42.5% more sales dollars flowing through our stores today than we did back in 2007. All those really promotes the 'pathway to profit' leverage and the improvement in profitability of the business. 
On Page 9, there's few paragraphs. We talked a bit about gross profit margin. Bottom line, I'd say there's a lot of noise in the numbers right now. We're kind of in the middle of that 51, 53 zone we've always cited. We still look optimistically at that number as we go forward because some of the things we talked about on our second quarter call, opportunities with our exclusive brands, how those opportunities are enhanced with our vending because they really go hand-in-hand. We really see over the upcoming quarters our ability to move that gross margin north and enhance the operating leverage of the business. So we're optimistic. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. 
One the thing that probably we don't talk about enough is the fact that with the strong growth in our large OEM business, both domestically and internationally, that puts quite a dampening effect on our gross margin. It doesn't hurt our operating margin at all because it's attractive operating margin business. But it has put a dampening effect on gross margin. So if anything, if you compare gross margin to a year or 2 ago, it's probably a little bit understated in that regard. But with that said, the number is what it is, and we believe we have growth drivers to move that number north in the future. 
On the operating administrative expense side, our payroll increased about 17.4%, and you see a dynamic going through the numbers now. Whereas last year, our quarterly number was quite a bit higher growth than our year-to-date number because we were in a pattern of bonuses in rising. Now we're in a situation where we're anniversary-ing some of those higher bonus numbers from a year ago, and that's why you're really seeing that payroll growth moderating quite dramatically because we're getting back to the point of growth for activity growth rather than moving out of easier comparisons. So while our growth is -- our net earnings are slightly below 30%, it's a powerful statement because we had a pretty good third quarter last year. 
The final item I'll touch on. Working capital, we continue, I believe, to manage it well. We still believe we have opportunities in inventory to keep tightening that and tightening that. But all things considered, I think we're operating that well, and most of you probably saw this last night, but we announced our fourth quarter dividend -- or our third quarter dividend payable in fourth quarter, $0.14, and that will be paid out here in November. 
With that, I will take some questions, and we'll go from there."

Actually the -- when we match up by customer size, we match up -- what I really do is I look at the customer last year and this year and even with the growth, the margin in most cases hasn't moved much. I mean, if there were a low-margin customer, we might be up or we might be down, but the trend is basically the customer margin changes very little when we add vending. The sales just go up. And it really, I think, has to do more with the pricing habits of our stores. So the store looks at this customer -- in many cases, they were a customer in the past. So the store looks at the customer and they were a 40% margin customer. When they've bid the vending product, they're probably bidding it in that range because it's just incremental business for the store. So it's actually very consistent. I've spent some time looking at that. I wish it was higher, but it's not. Now the opportunity we have is as we put in more Fastenal exclusive brands in those machines, we will see a margin improvement. But in many cases, we start out with a lot of branded product because that's what they were using. And then over time we plan to convert that."

And fewer employees than the organization in general because of the moderating ISM. We're very decentralized, and we try to share a lot of information with our regional and district leaders about what we're seeing. And with the moderating ISM, our folks pay attention. They're smart business people. They know not to get ahead of themselves. And so we're working diligently to have staffing where we need it. We don't want to hamper our growth. On the flip side, you'd be careful not to get ahead of yourself on certain things when there's uncertainty when you look out the next 6 to 12 months. As far as some of the other expenses, if I look at occupancy, about 1 point, I think it's 1.3% of our -- we grew at about 8.5%. 1.3 points of that came just from vending. And one thing that did pop our occupancy up a little bit more than I would have expected is energy prices are meaningfully higher than they were a year ago. And I don't know how it was nationwide, but we had some warm weather here in third quarter, so we're probably doing a little more cooling than we normally had. But still, look at our occupancy in general, we still have legs on that. When I look out to 2012, we typically will have 600 to 700 leases up for renewal in a given year, and one thing that you still have is there's still empty spaces out there. And there's also willingness on the part of the real estate community, if you will. I mean, if you look at the value of money and borrowing cost or incremental borrowing costs, the need for a 10% return on real estate that you might have seen 5 years ago, people are willing to take a little return, a, to keep the building occupied, and b, because their costs have gone down in many cases, or the ultimate use of that cash, probably a better way to say it, isn't as attractive as it might as been 4 or 5 years ago."

Now that diesel and gasoline prices are coming down over the last 4 to 6 weeks, going forward, we think we'll be in a good position in product movement. We're actually launching some new initiatives kind of stirring the pot, believing we can do better on transportation, turn it into a meaningful profit center over the next 2 years, and you'll hear more about that because that's kind of my pet. So we have some good initiatives going there. A couple of other things to note as far as how do you pull expenses back, maybe just not grow them as fast. If you look at 2012 or '11, we built the machine behind the machine, the vending group, which is well over 150 people. That group was in place, and we believe that they can do well over 1,000 machines both sell and install at their current level, so we have some built-in headroom per month -- excuse me, yes. Government sales, we put that in place this year. We're really not seeing the benefits yet. We have nice growth but not big dollars. Our metalworking team, we spent a lot of money there putting these people in and training them. And our district managers and regional vice presidents, we won't be adding many because of the lower store counts. So if you look at this group, these are higher paid individuals. And also in that group, you'd put our National Accounts group. We've over-invested in the last 12 months in all of these groups. The real benefits will come in 2012, and we don't -- we'll continue to invest but not at even close to the level that we did in 2011, and we should really see the benefits of that and drive our incremental profits."

On the National Accounts, we continue to sign accounts at a very nice rate, and a lot of that has to do with the vending, and that's what we hear from our National Accounts people, that we're getting continued opportunities. So we have very good momentum with National Accounts, and we will continue to invest in additional resources, i.e. people for the National Accounts team in 2012 because the ones that we've given them have given us above average returns."

So the only delay in installing the machines is we need to become better at figuring out what goes in each machine, and we continue to work on ways. But the customers want to be very involved, and many of them are slow.  It always takes a little longer than we think. In cases where the customer is just ready to go, many times we'll get an order and they'll be in place in 2 weeks because our guys can get them in if we can get the data set up or the information about what we're going to set in, put in the machines."

One thing I'll add to that is think about when we were coming into this year and the tail end of last year. We were looking at how we believe this would ramp up, and I might be over at certain times on what we spend for inventory or spend for fixed capital. But message to both our purchasing group, as well as our vending group is don't get caught naked here. We added some inventory early on because we wanted to have vendable products ready on the shelf. We have a backlog of machines. So we are ready to handle it from the standpoint of that product, if we end up having a few months too much because we over stretched ourselves, that product's a great product without a shelf life. But the cost of running out is too high, and so a little bit of our inventory, a little bit of our CapEx is there because we were willing to front load because we saw the potential in the opportunity here. With that, I'm going to cut off the call. We're at 45 minutes past the hour. And again, I want to thank everybody for joining in on the call this morning. Just a couple takeaway items I jotted down during the call. I probably sound a little like a stuck record here, but maybe in today's world, sometimes hearing the same thing from a company consecutive quarters is a sign of good things rather than being boring. But first off, our 'pathway to profit,' we're more convinced than ever that it just works. It's a logical profession  for our business, and it's working well throughout the organization. Very good sales patterns. One thing that I noted the other day when I was looking at some of the numbers, if I look at the last 6 months, so the second and third quarter of this year, on a 2-year comparison, our growth is in excess of 45% every month. We had actually one month over 50%. I have to go back at 2006 to see that type of a 2-year comparison. And 2006  was pre- 'pathway to profit'. So we were opening stores at about a 14% clip. So what that demonstrates to me is with focus, with energy and a bunch of growth drivers, we can continue to take market share at a very aggressive fashion in this marketplace, and it isn't strictly store centered. It's all facets of the business. The sales initiatives, we have great traction with them. Very good opportunity with our exclusive brands, and finally, as I mentioned last quarter, the employees of Fastenal continue to perform at a very high level. Thank you to them whoever's on the call. Have a good day, everybody."

Dan and I are going to both give some brief comments, and we're going to open it up for questions. I'd like to start by saying I think we had another good quarter. Our sales came in at 20.4% for the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're at 22%.
 For the third quarter, we were a little lower than the first 2 quarters, but we're still above the sequential trend -- our historical sequential trends. We're very optimistic about that. Our Manufacturing customers, as we stated, grew at 18.3% as compared to 18.5% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter. So there has not been a lot of change, but if anything, it's remained strong. So we're very optimistic about that. 
Non-Residential Construction grew at 15.8%, the same as the second quarter, and that's an area that there isn't a tremendous amount of activity. Most of that's coming in energy jobs and larger construction jobs in infrastructure, but you don't see much as you drive around in these tower cranes and things like that. So I think our team's doing a nice job digging it out wherever they can. 
So overall, the sales trends are good, and we remain optimistic in somewhat of an uncertain time. We don't have a tremendous amount of visibility, but the anecdotal stuff that we're getting from our people in the field is still quite positive, although there are a few signs of things slowing a little bit. But for the most part, it's very positive. 
On the earnings growth, we grew our earnings at 29.1%. Very good number. It's interesting though about perspective. I was looking at it going, ""Boy, we didn't even grow over 30%."" Because we've had such a good run, 29% is still a strong number. 
I feel very good about our expense control. I think that the team did a nice job. We picked up 140 basis points of pretax earnings over last year. Our goal of 'pathway to profit' is to pick up 100 points, so we've been able to exceed that goal. And I really feel good about the job the team did on controlling expenses. 
Pretax profit at 21.4% of sales. That's a record. And net income, north of 13% at 13.3%. That's a number I think we can also be proud of. There's only been -- I think last quarter is the only time we've ever exceeded 13% on a net income basis. 
Switching gears, talk about store openings a little bit. Our store openings came in lower than we had earlier -- than we had planned and thought we would earlier in the year. But I'm not overly concerned with this because at this point, I'd rather see -- if we can only get so many things done, which is really the case, I'd rather see that our people put more energy into our Automated Supply, our vending solutions, because it's more timely. 
Our competitors are not out opening stores in the markets that we plan to open in the future, but they are talking about Automated Supply and vending. So I think the faster we can move that project along, long term, that will be a better long-term strategic decision, and the store openings and the opportunities will probably be there in the future -- I believe will be there in the future. So we're working very hard on the Automated Supply. 
Talking about Automated Supply, I stated to anyone who would listen I think that I thought we could do or wanted to do 2,500 signings in the second quarter -- or, excuse me, in the third quarter. We fell short of that. We came in at 2,260. So I was disappointed with that. But when I look at the 2,260 and I compare it to where I thought we would be a year ago, it's a great number, and by any other measure, it's a very good number. But we're going to continue to push hard. 
What really happened is we dug a hole for ourselves in July. We didn't have a very good month of signings in July. We got behind in the first holiday week and never made it up for the rest of the quarter. 
On a very positive note, the team did a great job on the installations. We set up or we installed and turned on more than 1,700 machines in the quarter, and that's just a lot of hard work going into those customers, setting it up and getting these machines up and running. And I like the signings with the installs. It's really where the revenue starts, and so that's a positive. 
As Dan noted in the release, the overall sales growth, our year-over-year sales growth of the customers that have implemented vending Automated Supply remains strong at 49%. It's been 49%, right at 49% each quarter. And so that's a very positive note. We just need more customers to have Automated Supply, is kind of what we're thinking. Other initiatives that we've talked a lot about. 
Our Government sales initiative continues to do well. We had very strong sequential growth into the state and local business. Most of our Government business that we're focusing on is state and local business at this point. In the future, we would look at doing more federal, but right now, our focus is state and local. We think with our branch network, we're better positioned for that type of business. And so far, it's proving to be correct. 
On the metalworking initiative that we talked about, we feel very good about where we are. We have added a lot of product into our distribution system. That's part of our inventory growth. We continue to work at signing up strategic partners, the partners we need to fill out our product line, and that's gone very well. And we had said that we're going to put in 42 trained specialists. We have 37 in place, and 34 of them have gotten through our level 2 training, which is a training designed by an outside firm, again, working with our suppliers. And it's a very intense training. Our people are coming back with great feedback. 
So we really hope to see the results of this effort probably late, well, probably late in the first quarter into the second quarter of next year. These people are out selling now. Start gaining some traction and start seeing the results into 2012, but we're very optimistic. We met with our product development lead yesterday, and he gave us an update, and things seem to be moving in the direction that we had planned for them to move. 
On the personnel side, we have continued to invest in people. I believe this will flatten out in the fourth quarter really due to normal seasonal slowdown that we see in our business. The majority of our efforts go into the sales effort on the administrative and warehouse side, where we've added more people, if you've noticed that. 
Our Manufacturing business is doing very well, and we've added more people in there. And on the administrative side, most of those additions have been people that we put in to help push the vending systems. So it's really more of a sales service effort, the people setting up the machines and those things. 
And I'm really proud of this. As a leader, I'm proud of the fact that Fastenal is in a position to be adding employees. When you listen to the news and you see the slow economy and all the things that are going on, and I tell our employees this, I think we should be very proud of the fact we've added about 2,000 great opportunities this year to people out and trying to push the economy forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and he'll make a few comments. Then we'll open it up for questions."

First off, sales trends continue to follow or exceed our benchmark trend line. 
If you look at history, history would indicate that we should be at about 16% growth from our daily average in January to our daily average in September. This year, we're actually up 20.8%. So we're running about 5 points ahead of that trend line, which has given us nice launching pad as we go into 2012. 
Digging a lot deeper into the release, one thing I wanted to add on the end-market trends -- Will touched on them already -- is that we've been in a situation where the ISM index has been moderating now for about 5 months, and we continue to perform well. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we really think our vending and our international is helping giving a nice boost to this, but our domestic, our North American business is doing just fine in and of itself. 
On the Non-Residential side, Will touched on some of the energy projects that we're supplying into. I think at the end of the day, it's that and it's the fact that our store employees are just resourceful at turning over stones to find business. We're really well positioned to go after a lot of the small projects that a lot of other companies either aren't as aggressive with or aren't as interested in going after. And our stores sell on smaller projects all day long, and that's really a lot of little dollars are really what's driving our Non-Residential Construction.
The vending stats. I'll touch on a few things that Will mentioned as well, but I guess the 2 things that jumped out for me when we were pooling together the earnings release was the fivefold increase in the number of installs from Q3 2010 to Q3 2011. And my comments there would be nice job to Russ and his team in ramping up not just what we're doing to promote vending, but what we're doing to install. Because Will is right. The revenue starts after the machine is installed, not after the contract is signed. 
The other item is taking a step back and thinking for a second.13% of our sales now going to customers that have vending as part of their operation, and that customer base is growing at basically 50%. And to me the part that's most meaningful there is the fact that this is a predominantly Manufacturing customer base. It's medium-sized customers. It's not small customers or large customers. It's been driven by a broad brush, but the dollars to move the needle on those kind of dollars and the way we're moving it is quite staggering. And the fact that this business becomes very sticky because we're really providing a better solution than the competitor down the street. 
'Pathway to profit' on Page 7 of the release, we've hit a new high on the average store size, 83,000 a month. Our previous high was in third quarter of 2008 when we were at 82,000, and it's no coincidence that our record high for pretax earnings is this quarter because the 'pathway to profit,' the mechanics and the fundamentals of it are just kicking in, as we've seen in prior quarters. 
The -- if I look through some of the mix of employees, our store FTE is up about 16% on a year-over-year basis. Since we started the 'pathway to profit,' we've added 35% more employees on an FTE basis into our store. On the non-store selling side, we've added 44 people in the last 12 months. We've added 49 -- 44% in the last 12 months, 49% since the first quarter of 2007. So you can really see the energy that's being invested into the growth drivers of our business over the last 12 months. And those are the types of things that are driving the vending, that are driving the Government, that are driving our strength in Manufacturing business. 
On the DC side, up about 7 -- 16.7%. Since we started the 'pathway to profit', we're up 19.5% FTE. 5 points of that came from the Holo-Krome acquisition. So we've done a nice job of leveraging that side of the business over the last -- since 2007. And I believe we have the ability to keep leveraging that into the future. 
And then finally, as Will touched on, on the support side, we've added about 11.7% in the last year. A good meaningful piece of that is centered on back office support for our initiatives. But since 2007, we've added 5.7% more people, but we have 42.5% more sales dollars flowing through our stores today than we did back in 2007. All those really promotes the 'pathway to profit' leverage and the improvement in profitability of the business. 
On Page 9, there's few paragraphs. We talked a bit about gross profit margin. Bottom line, I'd say there's a lot of noise in the numbers right now. We're kind of in the middle of that 51, 53 zone we've always cited. We still look optimistically at that number as we go forward because some of the things we talked about on our second quarter call, opportunities with our exclusive brands, how those opportunities are enhanced with our vending because they really go hand-in-hand. 
We really see over the upcoming quarters our ability to move that gross margin north and enhance the operating leverage of the business. So we're optimistic. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. One the thing that probably we don't talk about enough is the fact that with the strong growth in our large OEM business, both domestically and internationally, that puts quite a dampening effect on our gross margin. It doesn't hurt our operating margin at all because it's attractive operating margin business. But it has put a dampening effect on gross margin. 
So if anything, if you compare gross margin to a year or 2 ago, it's probably a little bit understated in that regard. But with that said, the number is what it is, and we believe we have growth drivers to move that number north in the future. 
On the operating administrative expense side, our payroll increased about 17.4%, and you see a dynamic going through the numbers now. Whereas last year, our quarterly number was quite a bit higher growth than our year-to-date number because we were in a pattern of bonuses in rising. Now we're in a situation where we're anniversary-ing some of those higher bonus numbers from a year ago, and that's why you're really seeing that payroll growth moderating quite dramatically because we're getting back to the point of growth for activity growth rather than moving out of easier comparisons. So while our growth is -- our net earnings are slightly below 30%, it's a powerful statement because we had a pretty good third quarter last year. 
The final item I'll touch on. Working capital, we continue, I believe, to manage it well. We still believe we have opportunities in inventory to keep tightening that and tightening that.

I mean, if there were a low-margin customer, we might be up or we might be down, but the trend is basically the customer margin changes very little when we add vending. The sales just go up. And it really, I think, has to do more with the pricing habits of our stores. So the store looks at this customer -- in many cases, they were a customer in the past. So the store looks at the customer and they were a 40% margin customer. When they've bid the vending product, they're probably bidding it in that range because it's just incremental business for the store. So it's actually very consistent. I've spent some time looking at that. I wish it was higher, but it's not. Now the opportunity we have is as we put in more Fastenal exclusive brands in those machines, we will see a margin improvement.

They're smart business people. They know not to get ahead of themselves. And so we're working diligently to have staffing where we need it. We don't want to hamper our growth. On the flip side, you'd be careful not to get ahead of yourself on certain things when there's uncertainty when you look out the next 6 to 12 months. As far as some of the other expenses, if I look at occupancy, about 1 point, I think it's 1.3% of our -- we grew at about 8.5%.1.3 points of that came just from vending. And one thing that did pop our occupancy up a little bit more than I would have expected is energy prices are meaningfully higher than they were a year ago. And I don't know how it was nationwide, but we had some warm weather here in the third quarter, so we're probably doing a little more cooling than we normally had. But still, look at our occupancy in general, we still have legs on that. When I look out to 2012, we typically will have 600 to 700 leases up for renewal in a given year, and one thing that you still have is there's still empty spaces out there. And there's also willingness on the part of the real estate community, if you will. I mean, if you look at the value of money and borrowing cost or incremental borrowing costs, the need for a 10% return on real estate that you might have seen 5 years ago, people are willing to take a lower return, a, to keep the building occupied, and b, because their costs have gone down in many cases, or the ultimate use of that cash, probably a better way to say it, isn't as attractive as it might have been 4 or 5 years ago."

Now that diesel and gasoline prices are coming down over the last 4 to 6 weeks, going forward, we think we'll be in a good position in product movement. We're actually launching some new initiatives kind of stirring the pot, believing we can do better on transportation, turn it into a meaningful profit center over the next 2 years, and you'll hear more about that because that's kind of my pet. So we have some good initiatives going there. A couple of other things to note as far as how do you pull expenses back, maybe just not grow them as fast. If you look at 2012 or '11, we built the machine behind the machine, the vending group, which is well over 150 people. That group was in place, and we believe that they can do well over 1,000 machines both sell and install at their current level, so we have some built-in headroom per month -- excuse me, yes. Government sales, we put that in place this year. We're really not seeing the benefits yet. We have nice growth but not big dollars. Our metalworking team, we spent a lot of money there putting these people in and training them. And our district managers and regional vice presidents, we won't be adding many because of the lower store counts. So if you look at this group, these are higher paid individuals. And also in that group, you'd put our National Accounts group. We've over-invested in the last 12 months in all of these groups. The real benefits will come in 2012, and we don't -- we'll continue to invest but not at even close to the level that we did in 2011, and we should really see the benefits of that and drive our incremental profits."

And that is very attractive from the opportunity not only to go after business that maybe you wouldn't go after before because the margin wasn't attractive enough.

One thing I'll add to that is think about when we were coming into this year and the tail end of last year. We were looking at how we believe this would ramp up, and I might be over at certain times on what we spend for inventory or spend for fixed capital. But message to both our purchasing group, as well as our vending group is don't get caught naked here. We added some inventory early on because we wanted to have vendable products ready on the shelf. We have a backlog of machines. So we are ready to handle it from the standpoint of that product, if we end up having a few months too much because we over stretched ourselves, that product's a great product without a shelf life. But the cost of running out is too high, and so a little bit of our inventory, a little bit of our CapEx is there because we were willing to front load because we saw the potential in the opportunity here. With that, I'm going to cut off the call. We're at 45 minutes past the hour. And again, I want to thank everybody for joining in on the call this morning. Just a couple takeaway items I jotted down during the call. I probably sound a little like a stuck record here, but maybe in today's world, sometimes hearing the same thing from a company consecutive quarters is a sign of good things rather than being boring. But first off, our 'pathway to profit,' we're more convinced than ever that it just works. It's a logical profession for our business, and it's working well throughout the organization. Very good sales patterns. One thing that I noted the other day when I was looking at some of the numbers, if I look at the last 6 months, so the second and third quarter of this year, on a 2-year comparison, our growth is in excess of 45% every month. We had actually one month over 50%. I have to go back at 2006 to see that type of a 2-year comparison. And 2006 was pre- 'pathway to profit'. So we were opening stores at about a 14% clip. So what that demonstrates to me is with focus, with energy and a bunch of growth drivers, we can continue to take market share at a very aggressive fashion in this marketplace, and it isn't strictly store centered. It's all facets of the business. The sales initiatives, we have great traction with them. Very good opportunity with our exclusive brands, and finally, as I mentioned last quarter, the employees of Fastenal continue to perform at a very high level. Thank you to them whoever's on the call. Have a good day, everybody."
