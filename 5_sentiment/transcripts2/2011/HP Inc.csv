Since becoming CEO, one of the most commonly asked questions have been ""What does HP do and where does HP need to improve?"" With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insider's perspective on the answer. For starters, I'm convinced that we have the core strength to deliver for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. When you look where the market is heading, with cloud and connectivity converging, HP is well-positioned to win. I'm confident in our future and our ability to execute effectively. 
I'm also confident that our business model can sustain our earnings growth. Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful operating leverage and diversity of our portfolio. Revenue 4%, gross profit 10%, operating profit 14% and cash flow from operations and EPS were both up over 20%. We have a business model that benefits from scale and leadership in our core business and we have an evolving portfolio mixed with higher margin businesses such as networking, helping to extend company gross margins. As we discussed during the last earnings call, gross margin expansion allows us to invest for future growth. Q1 operating profitability was in dollars and percentage was strong and demonstrated sound financial discipline. Thus, our Q1 results also showed that we have opportunities to improve our growth in a few isolated areas. Despite strong profitability and cash flow in the quarter, we did not meet our top-line growth expectations and I'll provide some specific color on PSG and services. 
Let me start with PSG, which declined 1% year-over-year. Going into the year, we've made a few assumptions about the PC market in our business. First, we assumed that we would enhance our number one share position. Indeed, in the most recently reported calendar quarter, HP crew its worldwide sequential share in every category, in commercial, desktops, notebooks. HP holds the number one share in both desktop and notebook. Second, we assumed that we would capitalize on the growth in the commercial market, again in Q1. Commercial PC planned revenue by 11% year-over-year showing good growth in each region. We also assumed that we would execute a recovery plan in China in Q1, we grew our PSG China revenue 25% sequentially. We are showing good progress, but we still had work to do. Finally, we assumed that we delivered growth in consumer. Unfortunately, this did not play out in Q1 due to the softness in overall consumer PC market. Our consumer PC planned revenue was down 12% year-over-year. PSG continues to demonstrate solid execution, leveraging its portfolio of risk, graphical reach and customer diversity. Despite the soft consumer market in PCs, PCs operating profits increased 27% year-over-year, delivering 6.4% operating margins. And most importantly, I'm very pleased with our February 9 webOS announcement. We are all excited about our webOS platform, device that announced an incremental opportunities that webOS provides. The enthusiasm and anticipation for webOS exceeded even our most optimistic expectations. We look forward to providing a differentiated, seamless experience across our tablets, smartphones, printers, PCs and future. 
Moving to services, we have a mixed performance in the quarter. Again, we made a few assumptions going into the year. We assumed that we would increase long-term signings having solidified a steady annuity-based revenue streams. In Q1, we achieved delivering solid signings, including a $1.4 billion deal this year and a record number of megadeals, each greater than $100 million of total contract value. We also seemed growth in HP product with Enterprise Services. In Q1, we continued to show strength, going pull-through double-digit year-over-year. Finally, we assumed that are project related short-term higher value-added services will generated a relatively higher gross rate address of our services portfolio. It is consistent with the expected market gross rates for value-added services. But in Q1, we did not achieve our expected level of short-term signings or project-based revenues pico this impacted both our Application Services in our IT revenue for the quarter. We have a significant opportunity in services. In fact, when I meet with customers and are asking HP to increase our relationship with them whether it be helping them to consolidate data centers, modernize their applications or transition to hybrid cloud environments. 
So what are we doing to improve our growth and higher value-added services? We are continuing strengthening and enhancing our sales and delivery capabilities. The services transformation efforts announced last year was our ultimate and improved our processes and tools, which we expect result in better competitive position in the market. We've made good progress on new service offerings like our one-day cloud development workshop for HP cloud consultants, work with customers to meet the options in cloud computing. We are continuing to improve our higher value-added service offerings and ability to serve and deliver with long-term and short-term signings. We have a real opportunity to drive more value to our customers and that's what we're focused in doing. 
Q1 demonstrated the power of HP's robust portfolio. In our existing core businesses, as well as a new product launches and innovations. In addition to our successful webOS launch, we achieved other highlights over the past quarter. ESSN delivered another strong quarter. Our networking business continues to be an exciting opportunity. It's a big market. It has good margins and we expect to continue gaining share. In service and storage, we demonstrating how it innovation like great system matrix, Virtual Connect and StoreOnce is driving growth. We also demonstrate that we can integrate best technology into HP with acquisition. The recent security acquisitions in software are also off to a slow start. Enterprises are going through a transformation within consumerization of ICANN to shift the cloud computing with our integrated management and security offerings, HP provides a completely different approach to enterprise security and compliance and our software security portfolio has a strong performance in Q1. 
In January, we announced several new cloud solutions, including our ECS computing. It is an enterprise self-service offering bringing a new paradigm of computing to businesses. We leverage our strength of HP's scale, enterprise and reliability and our unique ability to manage hybrid IT environments. 
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire vertical. With this acquisition, we will strengthen our capabilities for information optimization, adding realtime business analytical data. We have with other acquisitions our scale and reach to acquire. At the same time, it will bring new revenue to HP customers in our ecosystem. 
IPG continues to innovate and execute strategy delivering another strong quarter with 7% revenue growth and share gains in both laser and ink. It was a performance regions, driven by strength in commercial. Commercial units were up 33% year-over-year and graphic arts posted strong double-digit growth. 
As I stated in my opening remarks, HP is well-positioned to lead the IT industry. If you use Q1 as a marker, it's clear that we do a lot of things well at HP. But it's also clear that have isolated areas that we need to improve and then committed to making these improvements to drive increased growth and operational excellence. 
As you all know, I'll be hosting a strategies summit on March 14 in San Francisco. Here's what you should expect from the event. I'll go over HP strategy and how it will continue to evolve. I'll talk about the opportunities we see in a more seamlessly connected world on the enterprise through the consumer, leveraging our strengths in cloud and connectivity and a portfolio of hardware, services, software and solutions we need to make that happen. 
For those of you who will be in person, you also have the opportunity to interact with many of our senior dealers. It's not a meeting where we lay out long-term financial plan or guidance. It's a discussion where we see the markets going, why HP is uniquely positioned, how we expect to win and the March 14th summit will be my first chance as HP's senior to engage with many of you in person and I very much look forward to seeing you there. I now hand the call over to Cathy."

HP continue to demonstrate disciplined execution in Q1. We added over $1 billion of revenue growth, expanded gross margins and operating margins, grew earnings per share by 27% year-on-year and generated $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to review our annual reclassification process. Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make changes across and within the reported segments to reflect organizational shift between the businesses. This year, we've made several changes that I will now highlight for you. As I told you in the fall, networking has moved into the renamed Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking segment from Corporate Investments. In addition, the Communications and Media Solutions business transferred from HP software to services and the Business Intelligence business moved from HP software to Corporate Investments. A detailed bridge of these changes, including historical data is available on our Investor Relations website, as well as furnished on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. I want to be very clear that this is an annual process designed to align our financial reporting structure with business changes and that the changes do not impact HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS. However, in the interest of complete disclosure, we felt it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call. With that, let's review the details of the quarter. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $32.3 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We continue to see good performance in our Commercial Hardware businesses led by strength in Converged Infrastructure and commercial printers and PCs. We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across these businesses, with enterprise servers, storage and networking growing 32% and commercial print hardware and PSU commercial revenue increasing 13% and 11% respectively. 
Looking at our results by geography. Revenue in the Americas and Asia-Pacific increased 6% and 7% respectively while revenue in EMEA was flat year-on-year. Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth. On a constant-currency basis, we saw balanced growth with revenue up 5% in the Americas, 4% in EMEA and 2% in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 24.4%, up 1.5 points from the prior-year demonstrating the company's ability to sustain growth margin expansion as we outlined at our analyst in September. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of HP Networking and PSG into a benign commodity pricing environment. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses was $3.9 billion, including the benefit from net gains primarily associated with the real estate sale announced previously. Excluding these net gains, operating expenses were $4.1 billion, increasing year-over-year due to both investments in R&D and sales coverage, and as a result of acquisitions. We will continue to be prudent in our investments and actively monitor their progress. These results demonstrate our ability to modulate our expenses in a way that enables us to balance investment in the businesses while delivering strong results to shareholders. 
Non-GAAP other income and expense was a net expense of $97 million, as benefits from net currency gains and other income partially offset other expenses. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 14% year-on-year to $4 billion or 12.4% of revenues, including an 80-basis-point positive net impact from real estate. Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 40 basis points as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales coverage in R&D. 
First quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.36. In the first quarter, HP continued to execute our vision for the next generation data center, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure from storage, servers and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew 22% to $5.6 billion with balanced growth across every region. 
Operating profits for the business was up 36% to $828 million for the quarter. with operating margin of 14.7%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior-year demonstrating the operating leverage in the business model. 
Our industry standard servers remained number one in share across all three regions, with revenue growth of 17% and ESS after revenue increased 23% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was flat year-over-year, the Superdome two systems are resonating well with customers, with strong growth in the Americas offsetting uneven performance in the other geographies. We continue to make good progress on our program to displace competitive UNIX products in Q1. 
Storage revenue increased 14% from the prior-year, led by strong growth in our scaleout products and data D duplication technology. Integration of 3PAR is ahead of plan and we saw continued interest from both existing and new customers. We are on a task to leverage HP's broad channel and enterprise sales force to expand three parts growth market. 
HP Networking grew 183%, including the acquisition of 3com. With over 30% growth in our routing and switching business, the proof of concept programs is yielding results. We added more than 14 of accounts including DreamWorks and HFI. Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, down 2% from the prior-year quarter and down 1%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. Services segment operating profit in the quarter was $1.4 billion or 16% of revenue, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven by continued transformation of delivery. IT Outsourcing revenue was down 1% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. The business had good long-term contract signing. This business continues to generate solid revenue streams driving healthy products to pull through and profitability. 
Application Services was down 3% year-over-year as we didn't get the short-term project work needed to produce the revenue growth we were expecting. We are redoubling our focus and have added new leaderships to the team. In addition, we are strengthening both our solutions offerings and our sales coverage to improve performance in this business. 
Technology services revenue declined 1% and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 10% or down 2% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. As Leo outlined, our Services business had a mix overall performance in Q1 and we are taking actions that we expect to have a positive impact in the coming quarters. HP software revenue of $697 million was up 5% compared with the prior year led by 9% services growth. License and support revenue increased 3% and 5% respectively. First quarter operating margin was $123 million or 17.6% of revenue. We are pleased with the performance of our security portfolio, including the acquisitions of fortify and outside. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG delivered revenue of $10.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year and flat in constant currency, as softness in the consumer markets and our challenges in China offset our strength in commercial market. Desktop revenue grew 1% while total notebook revenue was down 5% year-over-year. The commercial refresh continues. Commercial client revenue grew 11% led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 43% revenue growth. We maintained our market leadership in commercial PCs and continue to expand share in the U.S. enterprise segment by focusing on winning new accounts from competitors and expanding our channel program. 
Consumer client revenue was down 12%. The consumer softness was predominantly in netbooks. Consumer desktop in the U.S. and notebooks in China. In China, we saw good progress in our plan to restore growth driving 25% sequential revenue growth in that market. In addition, we exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new products in the channel. 
Segment operating profit totaled a record $672 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and a more favorable product mix. 
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. I hope you saw the webOS event in February 9th where we announced the touchpad and two new smartphones, the pre-three. We've been working with the developer community to build out application ecosystem and are pleased with the progress so far. WebOS provides a differentiated platform that over time will redefine the user experience across HP device solutions from consumer to enterprise and from smartphones to tablets to other devices. 
The imaging and printing business delivered strong performance in the first quarter with revenue growth of 7% to $6.6 billion led by commercial revenue growth of 13% and supplies growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 13%, with commercial and consumer printer units up 33% and 7% respectively as we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher usage segments. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our growth initiatives and to lead the market with innovative new products. Our graphic arts business grew double digits and we are pleased with the momentum in our web press business. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 20% and 63% respectively while business inkjet unit shipments increased double-digit from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled. In addition, we shipped more than 3 million Web connect printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive their shift from analog to digital printing. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the first quarter, financing revenue grew 15% to $827 million. Financing volume increased 10% and net portfolio assets increased 14%. Operating profit of $79 million compares to $67 million in the prior-year period. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remained strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10 billion. Our first-quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days compared with 16 days a year ago due to the linearity in the quarter. In Q1, days sales outstanding increased to four days, inventories were flat and days payables decreased one day. Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter with an acceptable ranges. We generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion. During the quarter, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $8.6 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Given the consumer environment we saw in Q1 and the slower growth in our Services business, we are revising our full year outlook and we now expect revenue of $130 billion to $131.5 billion. For Q2, we expect revenues to be $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion. 
Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and we expect OI&E expense of approximately $600 million for the fiscal year, a tax rate of 32% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q4 to Q1. We expect weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal '11 to be 2.21 billion shares. Thus, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21. For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be $5.20 to $5.28, representing growth of approximately 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It obviously had good margin expansion. And we drove product pull through in the double digits. So long-term signings have been primarily in the IPO space. And frankly, over the last few quarters it's been a nice mix of both new logos, but also renewals. In Q1 as an example, we signed a record number of megadeals. Those are deals that are greater than $100 million in PCB and more than half of them were new logos. So we are making new progress there. These solid long-term signings are helping us to build what I would consider a foundation of solid annuity-based revenue. But the softness came in our short-term signings, and the short-term signings really are in the space of both ITO, as well as Application Services because there are short-term deals in ITO probably called on add-on work. Also in services, I think you need to take a look at Technology Services. Because as reported, technology services declined 1%, but we made a decision about a year ago to stop selling some low-margin third-party hardware. And that is generating good business -- it's a good business decision for us, but it's generating a headwind of about three points of growth in the Technology Services space and so that means that Technology Services, instead of really declining 1% on what I would call a go-forward basis is actually up two points. In constant currency, our Services business was basically flat year-over-year when you adjust for the third-party revenue headwind and the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. That doesn't mean that we don't think that there's an opportunity to improve in the short-term space."

So from a gross margins perspective, we did benefit this quarter from a benign commodity pricing environment.

But we don't expect the component prices to continue to be a benefit for us or as bigger benefit in Q2. And so what we are calling for basically, gross margin sequential perspective will be a little bit less uptick from Q1 to Q2 than what we have seen historically. So that's gross margins. In terms of OpEx, you absolutely have to adjust the OpEx trend for the net real estate gains that are in OpEx. So our OpEx or admin is actually understated by roughly $250 million of net real estate gains in Q1. If you take that out of the equation, we expect OpEx will increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 due to normal seasonality and the salary increases that we talked about in the last quarter. Obviously, all of the folks at gross margins, as well as the OpEx increase from Q1 to Q2 is completely factored into our guidance for Q2."

You're guiding sequentially for the lowest guidance in nine years other than 2009, which was the downturn for Q2, in terms of sequential change. It sounds like you're expecting things to actually get worse in Q2. And then when I looked at the back half of the year, you're actually guiding above normal seasonality for the midpoint of your range. So a pretty dramatic snapback. It feels like given the majority of services revenues is outsourcing and driven by long-term contracts, a turn in services of that magnitude doesn't appear to explain all of it.

I mentioned that earlier. In terms of the second half of the year, the reason why you see better-than-normal seasonality half-over-half is that we do expect to continue to recover the PSG, especially in China. We also expect on improvement in the short-term signings based on the actions that were taking in the services space. And finally, in the second half of the year, we'll also benefit from the launch of our new webOS family of products. So I think that kind of just shows what happens in the second half. In terms of your services comments, one thing that I think it's important to understand is that when you sign long-term ITO deals, there's a period of time where you would call transition and transformation, and that period of time is usually the first 12 to 18 months of the contract. And during that time, you do not recognize all of the revenue. In fact, a large chunk of the revenue is in fact deferred until the project gets into operations. And then, it is amortized over the remaining life of the deal. So again, long-term signings are great, in terms of building the base. But when you're in that period of time when you're building the base, there is a significant growth."

When I come to see you, one of the most commonly asked questions has been what does HP do well, and where does HP need to improve.  With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insiderâs perspective on the answer.For starters,",1402,"Thank you, Steve.  When I come to see you, one of the most commonly asked questions has been what does HP do well, and where does HP need to improve.  With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insiderâs perspective on the answer.
For starters, Iâm convinced that we have the core strength to deliver for our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders.  When you look where the market is heading with cloud and connectivity converging, HP is well positioned to win. 
Iâm confident in our future and our ability to execute effectively.  Iâm also confident that our business model can sustain our earnings power.  
Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful operating leverage and diversity of our portfolio.  We grew revenue 4%, gross profit 10%, operating profit 14%, and cash flow from operations and EPS were both up over 20%.
  We have a business model that benefits from scale and leadership in our core businesses.  And we have an evolving portfolio mix with higher-margin businesses such as networking, helping to extend company gross margins. 
As we discussed during our last earnings call, gross margin expansion allows us to invest for future growth.  If you want operating profitability, it was in dollars and percentage, whatâs strong and demonstrated sound financial discipline.  But, our Q1 results also show that there are opportunities to improve our growth in a few isolated areas.
Despite strong profitability and cash flow in the quarter, we did not meet our top-line growth expectations, and Iâll provide some specific color on PSG and services.  
Let me start with PSG which declined 1% year over year.  Going into the year, we made a few assumptions about the PC market in our business.  First, we assumed that we would enhance our number-one share position.  Indeed, in the most recently reported calendar quarter, HP grew itâs worldwide sequential share in every category; consumer, commercial, desktop, notebook.  HP holds the number-one share in both desktops and notebooks.  
Second, we assumed that we would capitalize on the growth in the commercial markets.  Again in Q1, we grew commercial PC planned revenue by 11% year over year showing good growth in each region.  We also assumed that they would execute a recovery plan in China.  In Q1, we grew our PSG China revenue 25% sequentially.  Weâre showing good progress but there still has work to do.
Finally, we assumed that we deliver growth in consumers.  Unfortunately, this did not play out in Q1 due to softness and the overall consumer PC market.  Our consumer PC client revenue went down 12% year over year.  PSG continues to demonstrate solid execution, leveraging its portfolio breadth, geographical reach and customer diversity.
Despite a soft consumer market in PCs, PSGâs operating profits increased 27% year over year delivering 6.4% operating margins.  
And most importantly, I am very pleased with our February 9, WebOS announcement.  We are all excited about our WebOS platform, the devices and that we announced and the incremental opportunity that WebOS provides.  The enthusiasm and the anticipation for WebOS exceeds even our most optimistic expectations.  We look forward to providing a differentiated seamless experience across our tablets, Smartphones, printers, PCâs and future phones.
Moving to services, we had a mixed performance in the quarter.  Again, we made a few assumptions going into here.  We assumed that we would increase long-term signings, helping to solidify a steady annuity-based revenue stream.
In Q1, we achieved this goal delivering solid signings, including a $1.4 billion deal with [inaudible] and a record number of mega deals, each greater than $100 million total contract value.  We also assumed growth in HP product pull through with Enterprise Services.  In Q1 we continue to show strength, growing our pull-through double-digit year over year.
Finally, we assumed that our project-related short-term higher value-added services would generate a relatively higher growth rate than the rest of our services before you.  It is consistent with the expected market growth rates for value-added services.  But in Q1, we did not achieve our expected level of short-term signings or project-based revenue.  This impacted both our application services and our IP revenue for the quarter.
  We have a significant opportunity in services.  In fact, when I meet with customers theyâre asking HP to increase our relationship with them whether it be helping them to consolidate data centers, modernize their applications, or transition to hybrid cloud environments.
So what are doing to improvement our growth and higher value added services? Weâll continue strengthening and enhancing our sales and delivery capabilities.  The services transformation efforts announced last year was to ultimate and improve our prophesies and tools, which we expect to result in better competitor position in the market.
Weâve made good progress on new service offerings like our one-day cloud development workshop where HP Cloud consultants work with customers to make the options of their computing. Weâll continue to improve our higher value-added service offerings and ability to serve and delivery with long-term and short-term signings.
  We have a real opportunity to drive more value to our customers and thatâs what weâre focus are doing.
Q1 demonstrated the power of HPs robust portfolio in our existing core businesses as well as new products and innovation.  
In addition to our successful WebOS Lounge, we achieved other highlights over the past quarter, giving us another strong quarter.  Our networking business continues to be an exciting opportunity, itâs a big market.  It has good margins and we expect to continue gaining shares.  In services and storage weâre demonstrating how innovation like grade-system metrics, Virtual Connect, and StoreOnce is driving growth.  
We also demonstrated that we can integrate best of our technology into HP with a [inaudible] acquisition off to a strong start.  The recent security acquisition in software, both ArcSight and Fortify, are also off to a strong start. 
Enterprises are going through a transformation with the customization of IT and the shift to cloud computing. With our integrative management and security offerings, HP provides a completely different approach to enterprise security and compliance, and our software security portfolio has a strong performance in Q1.
In January, we announced several new cloud solutions including our ECS-compute.  This is an enterprise cloud service offering bringing a new paradigm of computing to businesses.  Weâll leverage our strength of HPs skill enterprise security and liability and our unique ability to manage hybrid IT and volumes.
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Vertica.  With this acquisition, we will strengthen our capabilities for information optimization, adding real-time business for big data.  Just like we have with other acquisitions, weâll use our skill and reach to acquire Verticaâs growth.  At the same time, thereâll be new value to HP customers in our ecosystem.
IPG continues to innovate and execute strategy, delivering another strong quarter with the 7% revenue growth and share gains in both later and ink.  It was a balanced performance across regions driven by strength and commercial.  Commercial units were up 33% year over year, and graphic arts posted strong double-digit growth.
As I stated in my opening remark, HP is well positioned to lead the IT industry.  If you use Q1 as a marker, itâs clear that we do a lot of things well at HP.  But itâs also clear that we have isolated areas that we need to improve, and Iâm committed to making these improvements to increase growth and operational excellence.
  As you all know, Iâll be hosting a strategy seminar on March 14, in San Francisco.  Hereâs what you should expect from the event.  Iâll go over HPs strategy and how it will continue to evolve.  Iâll talk about the opportunities we see in a more seamlessly connected world from the enterprise to the consumer, leveraging our strength in cloud and connectivity, and the portfolio of hardware, services, software, and solutions we need to make that happen.
  For those of you who will be in person, you also have the opportunity to interact with many of our senior leaders.  Itâs not a meeting where we lay out long-term financial plan or guidance, itâs a discussion of where we see the market going, why HPâs uniquely positioned, how we expect to win.  And the March 14 summit will be my first chance as HPâs CEO to engage with many of you in person, and I very much look forward to seeing you there.
I now hand the call over to Cathie.

HP continued to demonstrate disciplined execution in Q1.  We added over $1 billion of revenue growth, expanded gross margins and operating margins, grew earnings per share by 27% year on year, and generated $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to review our annual reclassification process.  Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make changes across and within the reported segments to reflect organizational shifts between the businesses.
This year, weâve made several changes that I will now highlight for you.  As I told you in the fall, networking has moved into the renamed, enterprise service, storage, and networking segment from corporate investment.  In addition, the communications and media solutions business transferred from HP Software to Services, and the Business Iintelligence business moved from HPs Software to Corporate Investment.
A detail bridge of these changes, including historical data, is available on our Investor Relations website, as well as furnished on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC.
I want to be very clear that this an annual process designed to align our financial reporting structure with business changes and that the changes do not impact HPâs previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings, or EPS.
However, in the interest of complete disclosure, we felt it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call.  With that, letâs review the details of the quarter.
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $32.3 billion up 4% from the prior year.  We continue to see good performance in our commercial hardware businesses led by strength in converged infrastructure and commercial printers and PCâs.  We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across these businesses with Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking growing 22% and Commercial Print Hardware, and PSG Commercial Revenue increasing 13 and 11% respectively. 
Looking at our results by geography.  Revenue in Americad and Asia-Pacific increased 6% and 7% respectively while revenue in EMEA was flat year on year.  Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth.  On a constant currency basis we saw balanced growth with revenue up 5% in the Americas, 4% in EMEA, and 2% in the Asia-Pacific region.
Gross margin in the first quarter was 24.4% up 1.5 points from the prior year demonstrating the companyâs ability to sustain gross margin expansion as we outlined at our analyst day in September.
The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of HP networking and PSG and to a benign commodity pricing environment. 
Turning to the expense side.  Total operating expenses were $3.9 billion including the benefit from net gains primarily associated with the real estate sale announced previously.
Excluding these net gains, operating expenses were $4.1 billion increasing year over year due to both investment in R&D and sales coverage and as a result of acquisitions.  We will continue to be prudent in our investments and actively monitor their progress.  These results demonstrate our ability to modulate our expenses in a way that enables us to balance investment in the businesses while delivering strong results to shareholders.
Non-GAAP other income and expense yielded a net expense of $97 million as benefits from net currency gains and other income partially offset other expenses.
We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 14% year on year to $4 billion or 12.4% of revenue including a 80 basis points positive net impact from real estate.  Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 40 basis points as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investment in sales coverage and R&D.
First quarter non-GAAP net income improved year over year to $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.36.  
In the first quarter HP continued to execute our vision for the next generation data center including all aspects of the converged infrastructure from storage, servers, and networking to software and services.
The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew 22% to $5.6 billion with balanced gross across every region.  Operating profit for the business was up 36% to $828 million for the quarter.  With operating margin of 14.7%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the business model.
Our industry standard servers remained number one in share across all three regions with revenue growth of 17% and ESS delayed revenue increased 23% year over year.
Revenue in Business Critical Systems was flat year over year.  The Superdome 2 systems are resonating well with customers with strong growth in the Americas, offsetting uneven performance in the other geographies.
We continue to make good progress on a program to displace competitive UNIX products in Q1. 
Storage revenue increased 14% from the prior year led by strong growth in our Scaleout products and Data D Duplication technology.  Integration of 3PAR is ahead of plan and we saw continued interest from both existing and new customers.  We are on a path to leverage HPs broad channel and enterprise sales force to expand 3PARâs right to market. 
HP networking grew 183% including the acquisition of 3Com.  With over 30% growth in our routing and switching business, the proof-of-concept programs is yielding results.  We added more than 40 new accounts including DreamWorks and SHI. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion down 2% from the prior year quarter and down 1% excluding the impact of divestiture of the ExcellerateHRO.  Services segment operating profit in the quarter was $1.4 billion or 16% of revenue, up 30 basis points from the prior year driven by continued transformation of our server delivery.
IT outsourcing revenue was down 1% year over year, and flat in constant currency.  The business had good long-term contract signings.  This business continues to generate solid revenue streams driving healthy product pull-through and profitability.
Application services was down 3% year over year as we didnât get the short-term project work needed to produce the revenue growth we were expecting.  We are redoubling our focus and have added new leadership to the team.  In addition, we are strengthening both our solutions offerings and our sales coverage to improve performance in this business.
Technology services revenue declined 1% and business process outsourcing revenue was down 10% or down 2% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.  As Leo outlined, our services business had a mixed overall performance in Q1 and we are taking actions that we expect to have a positive impact in the coming quarter.
HP software revenue of $697 million was up 5% compared with the prior year led by 9% services growth, license and support revenue increased 3% and 5% respectively.  
First quarter operating margin was $123 million or 17.6% of revenue.  We are pleased with the performance of our security portfolio including the acquisitions of Fortified and ArcSight.
Turning to personal systems.  PSC delivered revenue of $10.4 billion down 1% from the prior year and flat in constant currency as softness in the consumer markets and our challenges in China offset our strength in commercial markets.  Desktop revenue grew 1% while total notebook revenue was down 5% year over year.
The commercial refresh continues.  Commercial client revenue grew 11% led by another strong quarter and work station which generated 43% revenue growth.  We maintained our market leadership in commercial PCâs and continue to expand share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by focusing on winning new accounts from competitors and expanding our channel programs.
  Consumer client revenue was down 12%.  The consumer softness was predominantly in netbooks, consumer desktop in the U.S. and notebooks in China.  In China we saw good progress in our plan to restore growth, driving 25% sequential revenue growth in that market.  In addition, we exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new product in the channel.
Segment operating profit total a record $672 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points year-over-year as TSG benefited from favorable component pricing and a more favorable product mix.
  Moving on to Palm, which is included in corporate investments.  I hope you saw the WebOS event on February 9, where we announced the touchpad and two new Smartphones, the Pre 3 and the Veer.  Weâve been working with the developer community to build up the application ecosystem and are pleased with the progress so far.  WebOS provides a differentiated platform that over time will redefined the user experience across HP device solutions from consumer to enterprise, and from Smartphones to tablets to other devices. 
The imaging and printing business delivered strong performance in the first quarter with revenue growth of 7% to $6.6 billion led by commercial revenue growth of 13% and supplies growth of 7%. 
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue.  Total printer unit shipments increased 13% with commercial and consumer printer units up 33 and 7% respectively as we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher usage segments.
We continued to see solid momentum in our growth initiative and to lead the market with innovative new products.  Our graphic arts business grew double-digits and we are pleased with momentum in our web press business.  Our color laser and multi-function printer units grew 20% and 63% respectively while business inkjet unit shipments increased double-digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled.
  In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter.  We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive this shift from analog to digital printing.
  HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results.  In the first quarter, financing revenue grew 15% to $827 million.  Financing volume increased 10% and net portfolio assets increased 14%.  Operating profit of $79 million compares to $67 million in the prior year period.
  Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow.  Our balance sheet remains strong.  We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10 billion.  Our first quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days compared with 16 days a year ago due to the linearity in the quarter.  In Q1, day sales outstanding increased four days, inventories were flat, and days payable decreased one day.
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges.  We generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion.  During the quarter, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.  At the end of the quarter we had roughly $8.6 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
  And now a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year.  Given the consumer environment we saw in Q1 and the slower growth in our services business, we are revising our full-year outlook and we now expect revenue of 130 to $131.5 billion.  
For Q2, we expect revenue to be 31.4 to $31.6 billion.  Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind.  We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and we expect OI&E expense of approximately $600 million for the fiscal year, a tax rate of 22%, and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q4 to Q1.
We expect weighted average shares outstanding for Fiscal â11 to be 2.1 billion shares.  Thus, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21. 
For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook.  We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be $5.20 to $5.28 representing growth of approximately 14 to 15% for the fiscal year.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

So services that we mentioned did have a mixed overall performance this quarter.  It had solid long-term findings.  It obviously had good margin expansion and we drove pull through, product pull through in the double digits. 
The long-term signings have been primarily in the ITO space.  And frankly, over the last few quarters itâs been a nice mix of both new logos but also renewals.  In Q1 as an example, we find a record number of mega deals.  Those are deals that are greater than $100 million in TCV and more than half of them were new logos, so weâre making progress there.  These solid long-term signings are helping us to build what I would consider a foundation of solid annuity-based revenue.  But the softness came in our short-term signings.  And the short-term signings really are in the space of both ITO as well as application services because there are short-term deals in ITO.  We call that add-on work.  
Also in services, I think you need to take a look at technology services because as reported, technology services declined 1%.  We made a decision about a year ago to stop selling some low-margin third-party hardware and that is generating good business - itâs a good business decision for us, but itâs generating a headwind of about 3 points of growth in the technology services space.  So that means that technology services, instead of really declining 1% on what I would call a go-forward basis, is actually up 2 points.  
In constant currency, our services business was basically flat year over year when you adjust for the third-party revenue headwind and the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.  That doesnât mean that we donât think that there is an opportunity to improve in the short-term space.

So from a gross marginâs perspective, we did benefit this quarter from a benign commodity-pricing environment.  We also benefited from an improving business mix as well largely due to network.  Less largely due to PSG as well, but we donât expect the component prices to continue to be a benefit for us, or as big a benefit in Q2.  And so what weâre calling for basically from a gross margin sequential perspective is that it will be a little less uptick from Q1 to Q2 than what we have seen historically.  So thatâs gross margins.
In terms of OpEx, you absolutely have to adjust the OpEx trend for the net real estate gains that are in OpEx.  So our OpEx or Admin is actually understated by roughly $250 million of net real estate gains in Q1.  If you take that out of the equation, we expect OpEx will increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 due to normal seasonality and the salary increases that we talked about in the last quarter.  Obviously, all of this, both the gross margins as well as the OpEx increase from Q1 to Q2 is completely factored into our guidance for Q2.

And my separate question is, you missed your own revenue guidance for Q1.  Youâre guiding sequentially for the lowest guidance in nine years other than in 2009, which was the downturn for Q2 in terms of sequential change.  So it sounds like youâre expecting things to actually get worse in Q2.  And then when I looked at the back half of the year, youâre actually guiding above normal seasonality for the mid-point of your range, so a pretty dramatic snapback.  It feels like giving the majority of your services revenues is outsourcing and driven by long-term contracts, a turn in services of that magnitude doesnât appear to explain all of it, so maybe you can help me with that.

And weâre remaining cautious about the environment for consumer PCs.  I mentioned that earlier.
In terms of the second half of the year, the reason why you see better-than-normal seasonality half-over-half is that we do expect to continue to recover in PSG especially in China.  We also expect improvement in the short-term signings based on the actions that weâre taking in the services space.  
And finally, in the second half of the year, weâll also benefit from the launch of our new webOS family of products.  And so I think that kind of shows what happens in the second half.
In terms of your services comment, one thing that I think is important to understand is that when you sign long-term ITO deals, thereâs a period of time where thereâs whatâs called transition in transformation.  And that period of time is usually the first 12 to 18 months of a contract.  And during that time, you do not recognize all of the revenue.  In fact, a large chunk of the revenue is in fact deferred until the project gets into operation.  And then it is amortized over the remaining licensing deals.  So again, long-term signings are great in terms of building the base.  But when youâre in that period of time where youâre building the base, there isnât significant growth.

On the service side, weâve now had five quarters of formula growth.  We have another 17% year over year in Q1 on the ISS, industries standard service side.  We had a number one in all three regions in X86 servers.  We gained market share year over year.  So thatâs performing really well.  
We have a very strong competitor position with our new product G6âs and G7âs.  And we believe that we can maintain a very strong competitive position going forward.
This is also by the way driven by some of IP that we put on top of these things, such as latest metrics that actually help us differentiate our product significantly.  
When it comes to [inaudible] and to the storage business, we are doing a great job.  Cathie already indicated that that integration is going really well.  We are focused on the next gen data center.  Storage is a key part of that.  And our future technology is a great compliment to our strategy and helps us differentiate from our competition there as well.  
And just to give you an additional color on the networking business, the 3Com integration has been a huge success.  We are ahead of plan on our three quarters.  And itâs a very quickly growing business for us, and weâll continue to see very good traction.

Since becoming CEO, one of the most commonly asked questions have been ""What does HP do well?"" and ""Where does HP need to improve?"" With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insider's perspective on the answer. For starters, I'm convinced that we have the core strength to deliver for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. When you look where the market is heading, with cloud and connectivity converging, HP is well-positioned to win. I'm confident in our future and our ability to execute effectively. I'm also confident that our business model can sustain our earnings power. 
Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful operating leverage and diversity of our portfolio. We grew revenue 4%, gross profit 10%, operating profit 14% and cash flow from operations and EPS were both up over 20%. We have a business model that benefits from scale and leadership in our core businesses and we have an evolving portfolio mix with higher-margin businesses, such as Networking helping to extend company gross margins. As we discussed during the last earnings call, gross margin expansion allows us to invest for future growth. Q1 operating profitability was, in dollars and percentage, was strong and demonstrated sound financial discipline. But networking our Q1 results also showed that we have opportunities to improve our growth in a few isolated areas. Despite strong profitability and cash flow in the quarter we did not meet our top line growth expectations, and I'll provide some specific color on PSG and services. 
Let me start with PSG, which declined 1% year-over-year. Going into the year, we made a few assumptions about the PC market in our business. First, we assumed that we would enhance our number one share position. Indeed, in the most recently reported calendar quarter HP grew its worldwide sequential share in every category, consumer, commercial, desktop, notebook. HP holds the number one share in both desktop and notebook. Second, we assumed that we would capitalize on the growth in the commercial market. Again, in Q1, we grew commercial PC client revenue by 11% year-over-year, showing good growth in each region. We also assumed that we would execute a recovery plan in China. In Q1, we grew our PSG China revenue 25% sequentially. We're showing good progress, but we still have work to do. Finally, we assumed that we delivered growth in consumer. Unfortunately, this did not play out in Q1 due to softness in overall consumer PC market. Our consumer PC client revenue was down 12% year-over-year. 
PSG continues to demonstrate solid execution, leveraging its portfolio breadth, geographical reach and customer diversity. Despite the soft consumer market in PC, PSG's operating profits increased 27% year-over-year, delivering 6.4% operating margin. And most importantly, I'm very pleased with our February 9 webOS announcement. We are all excited about our webOS platform, the devices that we announced and the incremental opportunities that webOS provides. The enthusiasm and anticipation for webOS exceeded even our most optimistic expectations. We look forward to providing a differentiated, seamless experience across our tablets, smartphones, printers, PCs and future phone cycles [ph]. 
Moving to Services, we had a mixed performance in the quarter. Again, we made a few assumptions going into the year. We assumed that we would increase long-term signings, having solidified a steady annuity-based revenue stream. In Q1, we achieved this goal, delivering solid signings, including a $1.4 billion deal this year and a record number of megadeals, each greater than $100 million total contract value. We also assumed growth in HP product pull-through with Enterprise Services. In Q1, we continued to show strength, growing our pull-through double digits year-over-year. Finally, we assumed that our project-related, short-term, higher value-added services will generate a relatively higher gross rate than the rest of our Services portfolio. This is consistent with the expected market gross rates for value-added services. But in Q1, we did not achieve our expected level of short-term signings or project-based revenue. This impacted both our Application Services and our IT Outsourcing revenue for the quarter. We have a significant opportunity on Services. In fact, when I meet with customers, they're asking HP to increase our relationship with them, whether it be helping them to consolidate data centers, modernize their applications or transition to hybrid cloud environments. 
So what are we doing to improve our growth in higher value-added services? We'll continue strengthening and enhancing our sales and delivery capabilities. The series of transformation efforts announced last year will have ultimate and improved our processes and tools, which we expect to result in better competitive position in the market. We've made good progress on new service offerings, like our one-day cloud development workshop, where HP cloud consultants work with customers to select the options of cloud computing. We'll continue to improve our higher value-added service offerings and ability to serve and deliver with long-term and short-term signings. We have a real opportunity to drive more value to our customers, and that's what we're focused on doing. 
Q1 demonstrated the power of HP's robust portfolio in our existing core businesses as well as new product launches and innovations. In addition to our successful webOS launch, we achieved other highlights over the past quarter. ESSN delivered another strong quarter. Our Networking business continues to be an exciting opportunity. It's a big market. It has good margins, and we expect to continue gaining share. 
In Servers and Storage, we're demonstrating how innovation, like BladeSystem Matrix, Virtual Connect and StoreOnce is driving growth. We're also demonstrating that we can integrate desktop-free technology into HP, with the 3PAR acquisition off to a strong start. The recent security acquisitions in Software, both ArcSight and Fortify, are also off to a strong start. Enterprises are going through a transformation with the consumerization of IT and the shift to cloud computing. With our integrated management and security offerings, HP provides a completely different approach to Enterprise security and compliance, and our Software security portfolio has a strong performance in Q1. 
In January, we announced several new client solutions, including our ECS-Compute. It is an Enterprise client self-service offering, bringing a new paradigm of computing to businesses. We leveraged our strength of HP's scale, Enterprise client security and reliability and our unique ability to manage hybrid IT environments. 
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Vertica. With this acquisitionnetworking we will strengthen our capabilities for information optimization, adding real-time business analytics for big data. The spec we have with other acquisitions would use our scale and reach require vertex [ph] growth. At the same time, it will bring new revenue to HP customers in our ecosystem. 
IPG continues to innovate and execute its strategies, delivering another strong quarter, with 7% revenue growth and share gains in both laser and ink. It was a balanced performance across regions, driven by strength in commercial. Commercial units were up 33% year-over-year and Graphic Arts posted strong double-digit growth. 
As I stated in my opening remarks, HP is well-positioned to lead the IT industry. If you use Q1 as a marker, it's clear that we do a lot of things well at HP. But it's also clear that we have isolated areas that we need to improve, and I'm committed to making these improvements to drive increased growth and operational excellence. 
As you all know, I will be hosting a strategy summit on March 14 in San Francisco. Here's what you should expect from the event. I'll go over HP strategy and how it will continue to evolve. I'll talk about the opportunities we see in a more seamlessly connected world, from the Enterprise to the consumer, leveraging our strengths in cloud and connectivity and a portfolio of hardware, services, software and solutions we need to make that happen. 
For those of you who will be in person, you also have the opportunity to interact with many of our senior dealers. It's not a meeting where we lay out long-term financial plan or guidance. It's a discussion of where we see the market going, why HP is uniquely positioned, how we expect to win, and the March 14th summit will be my first chance as HP's CEO to engage with many of you in person, and I very much look forward to seeing you there. I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

HP continued to demonstrate disciplined execution in Q1. We added over $1 billion of revenue growth, expanded gross margins and operating margins grew earnings per share by 27% year-on-year and generated $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Before I get into the details of the quarter I want to review our annual reclassification process. Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make changes across and within the reported segments to reflect organizational shifts between the businesses. This year, we've made several changes that I will now highlight for you. As I told you in the fall, Networking has moved into the renamed Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking segment from Corporate Investments. In addition, the Communications & Media Solutions business transferred from HP Software to Services, and the Business Intelligence business moved from HP Software to Corporate Investments. A detailed bridge of these changes, including historical data, is available on our Investor Relations website, as well as furnished on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. I want to be very clear that this is an annual process designed to align our financial reporting structure with business changes, and that the changes do not impact HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS. However, in the interest of complete disclosure, we felt it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call. With that, let's review the details of the quarter. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $32.3 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We continue to see good performance in our commercial hardware businesses, led by strength in Converged Infrastructure and commercial printers and PCs. We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across these businesses, with Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking growing 22% and commercial print hardware and PSG commercial revenue increasing 13% and 11% respectively. 
Looking at our results by geography. Revenue in the Americas and Asia-Pacific increased 6% and 7% respectively, while revenue in EMEA was flat year-on-year. Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, we saw balanced growth, with revenue up 5% in the Americas, 4% in EMEA and 2% in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 24.4% Networking, up 1.5 points from the prior year, demonstrating the company's ability to sustain gross margin expansion, as we outlined at our Analyst Day in September. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of HP Networking and PSG and to a benign commodity pricing environment. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses was $3.9 billion, including the benefit from net gains primarily associated with the real estate sale announced previously. Excluding these net gains, operating expenses were $4.1 billion, increasing year-over-year due to both investments in R&D and sales coverage, and as a result of acquisitions. We will continue to be prudent in our investments and actively monitor their progress. These results demonstrate our ability to modulate our expenses in a way that enables us to balance investment in the businesses while delivering strong results to shareholders. 
Non-GAAP other income and expense. There was a net expense of $97 million, as benefits from net currency gains and other income partially offset other expenses. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 14% year-on-year to $4 billion, or 12.4% of revenues, including an 80-basis-point positive net impact from real estate. Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales coverage and R&D. 
First quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.36. In the first quarter HP continued to execute our vision for the next-generation data center, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure, from Storage, Servers and Networking to Software and Services. 
The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew 22% to $5.6 billion with balanced growth across every region. Operating profit for the business was up 36% to $828 million for the quarter, with operating margin of 14.7%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the business model. 
Our Industry Standard Servers remained number one in share across all three regions, with revenue growth of 17% and ESS blade revenue increased 23% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was flat year-over-year. The Superdome 2 systems are resonating well with customers, with strong growth in the Americas offsetting uneven performance in the other geographies. We continue to make good progress on our program to displace competitive UNIX products in Q1. 
Storage revenue increased at 14% from the prior year, led by strong growth in our scale-out products and data deduplication technology. Integration of 3PAR is ahead of plan, and we saw continued interest from both existing and new customers. We are on a path to leverage HP's broad channel and Enterprise sales force to expand three parts growth to market. 
HP Networking grew 183%, including the acquisition of 3Com. With over 30% growth in our routing and switching business, the proof of concept program is yielding results. We added more than 14 new accounts, including DreamWorks and SHI. Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, down 2% from the prior year quarter, and down 1% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. Services segment operating profit in the quarter was $1.4 billion, or 16% of revenue, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven by continued transformation of reserved delivery. 
IT Outsourcing revenue was down 1% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. The business had good long-term contract signing. This business continues to generate solid revenue streams, driving healthy product pull-through and profitability. 
Application Services was down 3% year-over-year as we didn't get the short-term project work needed to produce the revenue growth we were expecting. We are redoubling our focus and have added new leadership to the team. In addition, we are strengthening both our solutions offerings and our sales coverage to improve performance in this business. Technology services revenue declined 1% and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 10%, or down 2% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. 
As Leo outlined, our Services business had a mixed overall performance in Q1, and we are taking actions that we expect to have a positive impact in the coming quarter. HP Software revenue of $697 million was up 5% compared with the prior year, led by 9% Services growth. License and support revenue increased 3% and 5% respectively. First quarter operating margin was $123 million, or 17.6% of revenue. We are pleased with the performance of our security portfolio, including the acquisitions of Fortify and ArcSight. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG delivered revenue of $10.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year and flat in constant currency, as softness in the consumer markets and our challenges in China offset our strength in commercial markets. Desktop revenue grew 1%, while total notebook revenue was down 5% year-over-year. 
The commercial refresh continues. Commercial client revenue grew 11%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 43% revenue growth. We maintained our market leadership in commercial PCs and continue to expand share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by focusing on winning new accounts from competitors and expanding our channel program. 
Consumer client revenue was down 12%. The consumer softness was predominantly in netbooks, consumer desktop in the U.S. and notebooks in China. In China, we saw good progress in our plan to restore growth, driving 25% sequential revenue growth in that market. In addition, we exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new products in the channel. 
Segment operating profit totaled a record $672 million, or 6.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points year-over-year, as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and a more favorable product mix. 
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. I hope you saw the webOS event on February 9th where we announced the TouchPad and two new smartphones, the Pre3 and the Veer. We've been working with the developer community to build out the application ecosystem and are pleased with the progress so far. WebOS provides a differentiated platform that, over time, will redefine the user experience across HP device solutions, from consumer to Enterprise, and from smartphones to tablets to other devices. 
The Imaging and Printing business delivered strong performance in the first quarter, with revenue growth of 7% to $6.6 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 13% and supplies growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion, or 17% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 13%, with commercial and consumer printer units up 33% and 7% respectively, as we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher-usage segments. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our growth initiatives and to lead the market with innovative new products. Our Graphic Arts business grew double digits, and we are pleased with the momentum in our Web Press business. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 20% and 63% respectively, while business inkjet unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled. In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the first quarter financing revenue grew 15% to $827 million. Financing volume increased 10% and net portfolio assets increased 14%. Operating profit of $79 million compares to $67 million in the prior-year period. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10 billion. Our first quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days, compared with 16 days a year ago, due to the linearity in the quarter. In Q1, days sales outstanding increased to four days, inventories were flat and days payable decreased one day. Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion. During the quarter we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter we had roughly $8.6 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Given the consumer environment we saw in Q1 and the slower growth in our Services business, we are revising our full year outlook, and we now expect revenue of $130 billion to $131.5 billion. For Q2, we expect revenues to be $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion. 
Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth, and we expect OI&E expense of approximately $600 million for the fiscal year, a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q4 to Q1. We expect weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal '11 to be 2.21 billion shares. Thus, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21. For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be $5.20 to $5.28, representing growth of approximately 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It had solid long-term signings, it obviously had good margin expansion and we drove product pull-through in the double digits. So long-term signings have been primarily in the ITO space, and, frankly, over the last few quarters, it's been a nice mix of both new logos, but also renewals. In Q1 as an example, we signed a record number of megadeals, those are deals that are greater than $100 million, in TCV [ph], and more than half of them were new logos. So we're making new progress there. These solid long-term signings are helping us to build what I would consider a foundation of solid annuity-based revenue. But the softness came in our short-term signings. And the short-term signings really are in the space of both ITO as well as Application Services, because there are short-term deals in ITO, it's probably -- we call it on add-on work. Also in Services, I think you need to take a look at Technology Services. Because, as reported, Technology Services declined 1%, but we made a decision about a year ago to stop selling some low-margin third-party hardware. And that is generating good business -- it's a good business decision for us, but it's generating a headwind of about three points of growth in the Technology Services space, and so that means that Technology Services, instead of really declining 1% on what I would call a go-forward basis, is actually up two points. In constant currency, our Services business was basically flat year-over-year when you adjust for the third-party revenue headwind and the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. That doesn't mean that we don't think that there is an opportunity to improve in the short-term space."

So from a gross margins perspective, we did benefit this quarter from a benign commodity pricing environment. We also benefited from an improving business mix as well, largely due to network -- less largely due to PSG as well. But we don't expect the component prices to continue to be a benefit for us or as big a benefit in Q2. And so what we're calling for, basically, from a gross margin sequential perspective is that it will be a little bit less uptick from Q1 to Q2 than what we have seen historically. So that's gross margins. In terms of OpEx, you absolutely have to adjust the OpEx trend for the net real estate gains that are in OpEx. So our OpEx or admin is actually understated by roughly $250 million of net real estate gains in Q1. If you take that out of the equation, we expect OpEx will increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 due to normal seasonality and the salary increases that we talked about in the last quarter. Obviously, all of this spoke to gross margins, as well as the OpEx increase from Q1 to Q2, is completely factored into our guidance for Q2."

And finally, in the second half of the year, we'll also benefit from the launch of our new webOS family of products. And so I think that, that kind of just shows what happens in the second half. In terms of your Services comment, one thing that I think is important to understand is that when you sign long-term ITO deals, there's a period of time where there's -- it was called transition and transformation. And that period of time is usually the first 12 to 18 months of a contract. And during that time, you do not recognize all of the revenue. In fact, a large chunk of the revenue is in fact deferred until the project gets into operation, and then, it is amortized over the remaining life of the deal. So again, long-term signings are great in terms of building the base, but when you're in that period of time when you're building the base, there isn't significant growth."

We have a very strong competitive position with our new products G6s and G7, and we believe we can maintain a very strong competitive position going forward. These are also, by the way, driven by some of the IP that we put on top of these things, such as BladeSystem Matrix that actually help us differentiate our products significantly. When it comes to 3PAR and to the storage business, we are doing a great job. Cathie already indicated that the integration is going really well.

Since becoming CEO, one of the most commonly asked questions have been ""What does HP do well?"" and ""Where does HP need to improve?"" With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insider's perspective on the answer. For starters, I'm convinced that we have the core strength to deliver for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. When you look where the market is heading, with cloud and connectivity converging, HP is well-positioned to win. I'm confident in our future and our ability to execute effectively. I'm also confident that our business model can sustain our earnings power. 
Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful operating leverage and diversity of our portfolio. We grew revenue 4%, gross profit 10%, operating profit 14% and cash flow from operations and EPS were both up over 20%. We have a business model that benefits from scale and leadership in our core businesses and we have an evolving portfolio mix with higher-margin businesses, such as Networking helping to extend company gross margins. 
As we discussed during the last earnings call, gross margin expansion allows us to invest for future growth. Q1 operating profitability both in dollars and percentage was strong and demonstrated sound financial discipline, but our Q1 results also showed that we have opportunities to improve our growth in a few isolated areas. Despite strong profitability and cash flow in the quarter we did not meet our top line growth expectations, and I'll provide some specific color on PSG and services. 
Let me start with PSG, which declined 1% year-over-year. Going into the year, we made a few assumptions about the PC market in our business. First, we assumed that we would enhance our number one share position. Indeed, in the most recently reported calendar quarter HP grew its worldwide sequential share in every category: Consumer, commercial, desktop, notebook. HP holds the number one share in both desktop and notebook. 
Second, we assumed that we would capitalize on the growth in the commercial market. Again, in Q1, we grew commercial PC client revenue by 11% year-over-year, showing good growth in each region. We also assumed that we would execute a recovery plan in China. In Q1, we grew our PSG China revenue 25% sequentially. We're showing good progress, but we still have work to do. Finally, we assumed that we would deliver growth in consumer. Unfortunately, this did not play out in Q1 due to softness in the overall consumer PC market. Our consumer PC client revenue was down 12% year-over-year. 
PSG continues to demonstrate solid execution, leveraging its portfolio breadth, geographical reach and customer diversity. Despite the soft consumer market in PC, PSG's operating profits increased 27% year-over-year, delivering 6.4% operating margin. 
And most importantly, I'm very pleased with our February 9 webOS announcement. We are all excited about our webOS platform, the devices that we announced and the incremental opportunities that webOS provides. The enthusiasm and anticipation for webOS exceeded even our most optimistic expectations. We look forward to providing a differentiated, seamless experience across our tablets, smartphones, printers, PCs and future form factors [ph]. 
Moving to Services, we had a mixed performance in the quarter. Again, we made a few assumptions going into the year. We assumed that we would increase long-term signings, helping to solidify a steady annuity-based revenue stream. In Q1, we achieved this goal, delivering solid signings, including a $1.4 billion deal with E.ON and a record number of megadeals, each greater than $100 million total contract value. We also assumed growth in HP product pull-through with Enterprise Services. 
In Q1, we continued to show strength, growing our pull-through double digits year-over-year. Finally, we assumed that our project-related, short-term, higher value-added services will generate a relatively higher growth rate than the rest of our Services portfolio. This is consistent with the expected market growth rates for value-added services. 
But in Q1, we did not achieve our expected level of short-term signings or project-based revenue. This impacted both our Application Services and our IT Outsourcing revenue for the quarter. We have a significant opportunity on Services. In fact, when I meet with customers, they're asking HP to increase our relationship with them, whether it be helping them to consolidate data centers, modernize their applications or transition to hybrid cloud environments. 
So what are we doing to improve our growth in higher value-added services? We'll continue strengthening and enhancing our sales and delivery capabilities. The services transformation efforts announced last year will help automate and improve our processes and tools, which we expect to result in better competitive position in the market. 
We've made good progress on new service offerings, like our one-day cloud development workshop, where HP cloud consultants work with customers to select the options of cloud computing. We'll continue to improve our higher value-added service offerings and ability to serve and deliver with long-term and short-term signings. We have a real opportunity to drive more value to our customers, and that's what we're focused on doing. 
Q1 demonstrated the power of HP's robust portfolio in our existing core businesses as well as new product launches and innovations. In addition to our successful webOS launch, we achieved other highlights over the past quarter. ESSN delivered another strong quarter. Our Networking business continues to be an exciting opportunity. It's a big market. It has good margins, and we expect to continue gaining share. 
In Servers and Storage, we're demonstrating how innovation, like BladeSystem Matrix, Virtual Connect and StoreOnce is driving growth. We're also demonstrating that we can integrate desktop-free technology into HP, with the 3PAR acquisition off to a strong start. 
The recent security acquisitions in Software, both ArcSight and Fortify, are also off to a strong start. Enterprises are going through a transformation with the consumerization of IT and the shift to cloud computing. With our integrated management and security offerings, HP provides a completely different approach to Enterprise security and compliance, and our Software security portfolio has a strong performance in Q1. 
In January, we announced several new cloud solutions, including our ECS-Compute. It is an Enterprise cloud self-service offering, bringing a new paradigm of computing to businesses. We leveraged our strength of HP's scale, Enterprise class security and reliability and our unique ability to manage hybrid IT environments.  
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Vertica. With this acquisition we will strengthen our capabilities for information optimization, adding real-time business analytics for big data. Just like we have with other acquisitions, we will use our scale and reach to drive Vertica's growth. At the same time, we'll bring new value to HP customers in our ecosystem. 
IPG continues to innovate and execute its strategies, delivering another strong quarter with 7% revenue growth and share gains in both laser and ink. It was a balanced performance across regions, driven by strength in commercial. Commercial units were up 33% year-over-year and Graphic Arts posted strong double-digit growth. 
As I stated in my opening remarks, HP is well-positioned to lead the IT industry. If you use Q1 as a marker, it's clear that we do a lot of things well at HP. But it's also clear that we have isolated areas that we need to improve, and I'm committed to making these improvements to drive increased growth and operational excellence. 
As you all know, I will be hosting a strategy summit on March 14 in San Francisco. Here's what you should expect from the event. I'll go over HP strategy and how it will continue to evolve. I'll talk about the opportunities we see in a more seamlessly connected world, from the Enterprise to the consumer, leveraging our strengths in cloud and connectivity and a portfolio of hardware, services, software and solutions we need to make that happen. 
For those of you who will be in person, you also have the opportunity to interact with many of our senior dealers. It's not a meeting where we lay out long-term financial plan or guidance. It's a discussion of where we see the market going, why HP is uniquely positioned, how we expect to win, and the March 14th summit will be my first chance as HP's CEO to engage with many of you in person, and I very much look forward to seeing you there. 
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

HP continued to demonstrate disciplined execution in Q1. We added over $1 billion of revenue growth, expanded gross margins and operating margins, grew earnings per share by 27% year-on-year and generated $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to review our annual reclassification process. Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make changes across and within the reported segments to reflect organizational shifts between the businesses. This year, we've made several changes that I will now highlight for you. 
As I told you in the fall, Networking has moved into the renamed Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking segment from Corporate Investments. In addition, the Communications & Media Solutions business transferred from HP Software to Services, and the Business Intelligence business moved from HP Software to Corporate Investments. A detailed bridge of these changes, including historical data, is available on our Investor Relations website, as well as furnished on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
I want to be very clear that this is an annual process designed to align our financial reporting structure with business changes, and that the changes do not impact HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS. However, in the interest of complete disclosure, we felt it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call. With that, let's review the details of the quarter. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $32.3 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We continue to see good performance in our commercial hardware businesses, led by strength in Converged Infrastructure and commercial printers and PCs. We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across these businesses, with Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking growing 22% and commercial print hardware and PSG commercial revenue increasing 13% and 11%, respectively. 
Looking at our results by geography. Revenue in the Americas and Asia-Pacific increased 6% and 7% respectively, while revenue in EMEA was flat year-on-year. Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, we saw balanced growth, with revenue up 5% in the Americas, 4% in EMEA and 2% in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 24.4%, up 1.5 points from the prior year, demonstrating the company's ability to sustain gross margin expansion, as we outlined at our Analyst Day in September. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of HP Networking and PSG and to a benign commodity pricing environment. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses were $3.9 billion, including the benefit from net gains primarily associated with the real estate sale announced previously. Excluding these net gains, operating expenses were $4.1 billion, increasing year-over-year due to both investments in R&D and sales coverage, and as a result of acquisitions. 
We will continue to be prudent in our investments and actively monitor their progress. These results demonstrate our ability to modulate our expenses in a way that enables us to balance investment in the businesses while delivering strong results to shareholders. 
Non-GAAP other income and expense. There was a net expense of $97 million, as benefits from net currency gains and other income partially offset other expenses. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 14% year-on-year to $4 billion, or 12.4% of revenues, including an 80-basis-point positive net impact from real estate. 
Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales coverage and R&D. 
First quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.36. In the first quarter, HP continued to execute our vision for the next-generation data center, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure, from Storage, Servers and Networking to Software and Services. 
The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew 22% to $5.6 billion with balanced growth across every region. Operating profit for the business was up 36% to $828 million for the quarter, with operating margin of 14.7%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the business model. 
Our Industry Standard Servers remained number one in share across all three regions, with revenue growth of 17% and ESS blade revenue increased 23% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was flat year-over-year. The Superdome 2 systems are resonating well with customers, with strong growth in the Americas offsetting uneven performance in the other geographies. We continue to make good progress on our program to displace competitive UNIX products in Q1. 
Storage revenue increased 14% from the prior year, led by strong growth in our scale-out products and data deduplication technology. Integration of 3PAR is ahead of plan, and we saw continued interest from both existing and new customers. We are on a path to leverage HP's broad channel and Enterprise sales force to expand three parts growth to market. 
HP Networking grew 183%, including the acquisition of 3Com. With over 30% growth in our routing and switching business, the proof of concept program is yielding results. We added more than 14 new accounts, including DreamWorks and SHI. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, down 2% from the prior year quarter, and down 1% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. Services segment operating profit in the quarter was $1.4 billion, or 16% of revenue, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven by continued transformation of reserved [ph] delivery. 
IT Outsourcing revenue was down 1% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. The business had good long-term contract signing. This business continues to generate solid revenue streams, driving healthy product pull-through and profitability. 
Application Services was down 3% year-over-year as we didn't get the short-term project work needed to produce the revenue growth we were expecting. We are redoubling our focus and have added new leadership to the team. In addition, we are strengthening both our solutions offerings and our sales coverage to improve performance in this business. 
Technology services revenue declined 1% and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 10%, or down 2% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. 
As Leo outlined, our Services business had a mixed overall performance in Q1, and we are taking actions that we expect to have a positive impact in the coming quarter. HP Software revenue of $697 million was up 5% compared with the prior year, led by 9% Services growth. License and support revenue increased 3% and 5% respectively. 
First quarter operating margin was $123 million, or 17.6% of revenue. We are pleased with the performance of our security portfolio, including the acquisitions of Fortify and ArcSight. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG delivered revenue of $10.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year and flat in constant currency, as softness in the consumer markets and our challenges in China offset our strength in commercial markets. Desktop revenue grew 1%, while total notebook revenue was down 5% year-over-year. 
The commercial refresh continues. Commercial client revenue grew 11%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 43% revenue growth. We maintained our market leadership in commercial PCs and continue to expand share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by focusing on winning new accounts from competitors and expanding our channel program. 
Consumer client revenue was down 12%. The consumer softness was predominantly in netbooks, consumer desktop in the U.S. and notebooks in China. In China, we saw good progress in our plan to restore growth, driving 25% sequential revenue growth in that market. In addition, we exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new products in the channel. 
Segment operating profit totaled a record $672 million, or 6.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points year-over-year, as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and a more favorable product mix. 
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. I hope you saw the webOS event on February 9th where we announced the TouchPad and two new smartphones, the Pre3 and the Veer. We've been working with the developer community to build out the application ecosystem and are pleased with the progress so far. WebOS provides a differentiated platform that, over time, will redefine the user experience across HP device solutions, from consumer to Enterprise, and from smartphones to tablets to other devices. 
The Imaging and Printing business delivered strong performance in the first quarter, with revenue growth of 7% to $6.6 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 13% and supplies growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion, or 17% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 13%, with commercial and consumer printer units up 33% and 7% respectively, as we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher-usage segments. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our growth initiatives and to lead the market with innovative new products. Our Graphic Arts business grew double digits, and we are pleased with the momentum in our Web Press business. 
Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 20% and 63% respectively, while business inkjet unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled. In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the first quarter financing revenue grew 15% to $827 million. Financing volume increased 10% and net portfolio assets increased 14%. Operating profit of $79 million compares to $67 million in the prior-year period. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10 billion. Our first quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days, compared with 16 days a year ago, due to the linearity in the quarter. In Q1, days sales outstanding increased to four days, inventories were flat and days payable decreased one day. 
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion. During the quarter we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $8.6 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Given the consumer environment we saw in Q1 and the slower growth in our Services business, we are revising our full year outlook, and we now expect revenue of $130 billion to $131.5 billion. For Q2, we expect revenues to be $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion. 
Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth, and we expect OI&E expense of approximately $600 million for the fiscal year, a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q4 to Q1. 
We expect weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal '11 to be 2.21 billion shares. Thus, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21. For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be $5.20 to $5.28, representing growth of approximately 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It had solid long-term signings, it obviously had good margin expansion, and we drove product pull-through in the double digits. So long-term signings have been primarily in the ITO space. And frankly, over the last few quarters, it's been a nice mix of both new logos, but also renewals. In Q1 as an example, we signed a record number of megadeals, those are deals that are greater than $100 million, in TCV, and more than half of them were new logos. So we're making new progress there. These solid long-term signings are helping us to build what I would consider a foundation of solid annuity-based revenue. But the softness came in our short-term signings. And the short-term signings really are in the space of both ITO as well as Application Services, because there are short-term deals in ITO, we'd probably we call it on add-on work. Also in Services, I think you need to take a look at Technology Services. Because, as reported, Technology Services declined 1%, but we made a decision about a year ago to stop selling some low-margin third-party hardware. And that is generating good business -- it's a good business decision for us, but it's generating a headwind of about three points of growth in the Technology Services space. And so that means that Technology Services, instead of really declining 1% on what I would call a go-forward basis, is actually up two points. In constant currency, our Services business was basically flat year-over-year when you adjust for the third-party revenue headwind and the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. That doesn't mean that we don't think that there is an opportunity to improve in the short-term space."

So from a gross margins perspective, we did benefit this quarter from a benign commodity pricing environment. We also benefited from an improving business mix as well, largely due to network -- less largely due to PSG as well. But we don't expect the component prices to continue to be a benefit for us, or as big a benefit in Q2. And so what we're calling for, basically, from a gross margin sequential perspective is that it will be a little bit less uptick from Q1 to Q2 than what we have seen historically. So that's gross margins. In terms of OpEx, you absolutely have to adjust the OpEx trend for the net real estate gains that are in OpEx. So our OpEx or admin is actually understated by roughly $250 million of net real estate gains in Q1. If you take that out of the equation, we expect OpEx will increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 due to normal seasonality and the salary increases that we talked about in the last quarter. Obviously, all of this spoke to gross margins, as well as the OpEx increase from Q1 to Q2, is completely factored into our guidance for Q2."

And finally, in the second half of the year, we'll also benefit from the launch of our new webOS family of products. And so I think that, that kind of just shows what happens in the second half. In terms of your Services comment, one thing that I think is important to understand is that when you sign long-term ITO deals, there's a period of time where there's  what's called transition and transformation. And that period of time is usually the first 12 to 18 months of a contract. And during that time, you do not recognize all of the revenue. In fact, a large chunk of the revenue is in fact deferred until the project gets into operation, and then it is amortized over the remaining life of the deal. So again, long-term signings are great in terms of building the base, but when you're in that period of time when you're building the base there isn't significant growth."

And then if you could just provide a little bit of color as part of that, on what your visibility is on the Services side. Because my understanding is when you enter the quarter you have a high degree of 90%-plus of visibility at least for the one quarter out period, so I'm surprised to hear some of the outlook difference comes from the Services side."

In Services, let's make absolutely sure that we understand that there are at least two different drivers here. One is the Outsourcing business, which is a long-term business, and Cathie has described already all of the mechanics of that business. And then there is the variable, which is the short-term value-added business, which can actually fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In Q1, we had a number of significant issues that we had to address. We have addressed them. Our portfolio is much stronger going forward. And with the focus that you're going to put on value-added services, I feel confident that, quarter after quarter, we'll be able to pick up the pace and actually meet the guidance again."

Before we get started, they want to explain the decision to accelerate the time your 4Q to earnings announcement. Yesterday afternoon, we became aware of a published media reports quoting from an internal HP communication. While that communication did not contain information about HP's second quarter financial performance, we believe that having access to HP's second quarter financial results and fiscal 2011 financial outlook would assist investors in evaluating the information and media report.
We therefore determined the most prudent course of action under the circumstances was to accelerate our second quarter earnings announcement. Before handing the call over to LÃ©o, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year.

As Steve mentioned, we showed announcement early given the circumstances. As we discussed in March, the forces of cloud and productivity are changing the world of technology and creating exciting new opportunities. There Are new market realities in this world and some companies will be pay lipservice to change that because they're trying to protect their legacy business models. The weakness of the company is not only to about the future but also actually involve the strategy and adjust their business accordingly.
At HP, we intend to lead by making the right customer focus decision to take advantage of the changing technology landscape and by executing aggressively on our long-term strategy. As always, these decisions need to be balanced with a focus on operational efficiency and prudent financial discipline.
In the second quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute aggressively, make the right decisions for our future and drive operational efficiencies. We achieved solid results, growing revenue 3% and gaining market share in key segments. On profitability perspective, we expanded those growth in operating margins as we continue to drive a better portfolio mix. We grew non-GAAP EPS 14% versus our peers and we generated a healthy $4 billion cash flow from operations in the quarter.
We continue to make investments in the business with new innovations and incremental R&D spend. We launched many new offerings, including the successful launch of cloud systems, flex network and networking end of the year. Our customers had a very positive response to our strategy data. HP has made good progress bringing together assets across the company, cloud systems is a great example where we are leveraging conversion infrastructure, software, security and services to help customers build, manage and consume cloud services across private clouds, public clouds and traditional IT environments. We have already attracted thousands of customers in our pipeline.
In Q2, we continue to demonstrate strength in our commercial business across the company. Our commercial business, which represents gross 3 quarters of HP revenue was up 8% year-over-year. ESSN had another solid quarter, we continue to be the worldwide leader in service, and our Networking business is innovating and steadily taking share and I'm pleased with the improvements being made in our software businesses, which grew total revenues 17% and license revenue 29% versus our peers.
IPG executed very well across the board during the quarter, with particular strength in commercial. IPG is working diligently with Japanese data supplier and toner supplier to address anticipated customer financial impact, resulting from the earthquake and related events in Japan. More broadly, we're focused on working to minimize expected supply-chain impact in our fiscal second half. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of those who are working to the situation, but HP will not be immune to the impact.
In February, we highlighted 2 specific areas where we needed more attention: Consumer PC and Services. In said, we have done a great deal of work in each area, so let me give you an update on where we currently stand. The PC market continues to be bifurcated. On one hand, the commercial PC market remains strong. HP again grew commercial PC revenue double-digits, gaining share sequentially and year-over-year. Our totals and go-to-market are very well-positioned to capture the ongoing market corporate demand. On the other hand, the consumer PC market have continued to be challenging industry-wise. In Q2, consumer PC revenue declined over 20% year-over-year, even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the of our 4Q decline is greater than what we had anticipated. We remain cautious in the near-term.
However, we are excited about the opportunity. You'll be hearing and seeing more from our touchpad in the weeks and months to come. It will be an exciting product release for HP.
A quick update regarding PSG in China. Cloud industry have been very focused on driving our recovery plans. We made good progress in Q2 where we again grew double-digit sequentially. We still have significant headroom to get back the share we loss and we expect our momentum to carry into the second half.
Now let me shift to services. As I highlighted in March, services is an important part of HP's long-term strategy, giving platform to be more solution-oriented and a better strategic partner with our customers. A significant services footprint also provides architectural meet with customers. So as customers look to optimize their traditional IT environment, transition to private clouds, versus public clouds or transform to hybrid model, HP will help implement and manage these capabilities. That said, as I have been digging into our Services business HP and diving even deeper over the past couple of months, I've concluded that we had a solid strategy for services, but we didn't invest in the path to support a strategy. Instead, HP focused on maximizing a shorter-term margins. 
We have over executed operationally and underinvested strategically. As a result, our shorter-margin expectations have been too high. It has impacted our ability to create sustainable growth for the long term, in particular we have not yet shifted our services mix to higher value, higher margin and higher growth categories. 
You see it in our historical results. Our margins have expanded quickly and significantly but our revenue has not grown as far or should do now mix of IPO Application Services, EPO, and has been unchanged over the past several years. The same is true when I look at recent signage, which have been heavily weighted towards longer-term ITO deals. As the ITO deals our margins are pressured faster than revenue during the start-up phase. We want this ITO deals but our customers are asking us to expand our application in detail at more quickly. 
And we have a choice for you. HP can continue executing for some time along these same lines or we can improve the value of our Services business by further aligning our services strategy with the company's strategy. I've decided that we're not just going to talk about our future. We're going to aggressively execute on our strategy and make some immediate changes. 
First, due to the importance of increasing the value of our Enterprise Services business, we have decided to launch a search for an EVP for this business reporting directly to me. And Livermore, in addition to her role of EVP for Enterprise business will be the interim leader for ESSN. We have also decided to combined the Technology Services organization with the ESSN organization under leadership. The ESSN business has made great improvements over the last several years the next phase is to create greater go-to-market leverage with our products and embed more technology into our products for further automate services.
Second, we will accelerate portfolio investments in higher value-added services. We will deepen industry content and form a business solutions group to create more strategic value of our customers. We will enhance our services offerings in emerging areas, such as cloud services and consulting, application with the organization, Business Analytics and mobility.
Third, we will continue to enhance our delivery and sales capabilities. We will be increasing our bench strength in Application Services business. We will continue to invest in our sales, business development and delivery capabilities to increase customer satisfaction.
Finally, we will continue to have a tight focus on operational excellence. We will move forward with modernizing our data centers and rationalizing processes, leveraging HP Software.
It is my top focus point going forward. As I said in my opening remarks, companies need to evolve their strategies, address their business models and execute aggressively to entering these technologies shifts. This is exactly what we're doing. HP has derived long-term strategy and I expect the decisions announced today with our Services business will better align that business through our company strategy, that will enable us to meet the needs of our customers and generate more a sustainable return for our shareholders over the long term.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

In the second quarter, HP continues to build on our strategy of delivering cloud and connectivity from consumers to the Enterprises. With disciplined execution, we successfully expanded both gross margins and operating margins. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% and generated $4 billion in cash flow from operations. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $31.6 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Commercial hardware was strong across the company, but we still saw weakness in Consumer PC. We had solid performance in industry standard servers, ESS rates and software. Double-digit operational growth in Networking as it remains a large market opportunity and continued momentum in commercial printing.
By geography, revenue in Asia-Pacific region grew 10% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas grew 2% or 1% in constant currency and revenue in EMEA was down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 100 basis points from the prior year due to our continued favorable commodity environment as well as favorable mix from Networking, PSG and Software.
We are investing some of our gross margin improvement back into the business. Total operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and selling costs, both of which are expected to enable revenue growth in coming quarters. As we have said before, we actively monitor and evaluate all investments against key milestones as we work to achieve our objectives and deliver results of our shareholders.
Non-GAAP Other income/expense yielded a net expense of $76 million due to a more favorable currency impact. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 3% year-on-year to $3.6 billion or 11.3% of revenue. Second quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $2.7 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.24.
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on our cloud division, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure from storage servers and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew revenue 15% to $5.6 billion. Operating profit grew 1.5x revenue growth or 23% to $756 million for the quarter.
Operating margins of 13.8% was up 90 basis points from the prior year, driven by a favorable product mix and supply-chain savings. Our industry-standard service business remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 11%. Revenue and Business Critical Systems was up 1.5% year-over-year with strength in nonstop enterprise servers. In addition, customers are responding to the low total cost of ownership and the reliability in our Superdome 2 systems.
In storage, there is tremendous interest in the 3PAR utility storage solution as customers move to the highly virtualized and dynamically tiered storage arrays, built public and private cloud computing. 3PAR had another quarter of high double-digit operational revenue growth year-over-year and we are now selling 3PAR solutions in 23 new countries.
Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 3% from the prior year, with strong growth in our scale of products and the duplication technology, partially offset by lower revenue as some customers wait for the new product refresh this summer.
HP remains number 1 in the blade server market and grew ESS blade revenue 20% year-over-year. HP Networking grew 118%, including the acquisition of 3Com and 14% year-over-year on an operational basis. While our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses, we delivered double-digit growth in our Switching and Routing business. We saw continued expansion of our proof-of-concept program and have recently launched flex network architecture, significantly outperformed the incumbent equivalent product. 
LÃ©o talk you through some changes we are making to our Services business, but let me provide a bit more color, including the impact to our outlook. HP Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up 2% from the prior year quarter. We delivered operating profit of $1.4 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 60 basis points from the prior year. IT Outsourcing revenue was up 2% year-over-year. The business had good long-term contract signings, driven by renewals and continues to drive healthy double-digit product pull-through.
Application Services made progress in the second quarter, with revenue up 2% year-over-year and some improvement in its short-term project work. Technology Services revenue also grew 2% and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 6% or up 1%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of Excellerate HRO.
In Q3 of fiscal '11, we expect services margins of the 13.5% to 14% as a result of lower revenue growth in local currency, unfavorable mix and investments we are making to further enable higher-margin business. For Q4, we expect services margins to be a bit higher than in Q3. To better position ourselves for the future opportunities, we will need to invest in building value-added services, increasing our bench and building you delivery capabilities to these services.
We expect Services revenue to grow in the low-single digits on a reported basis in fiscal 2011. We are pleased to report the strong performance in HP Software with revenue of $754 million, up 17% compared with the prior year, led by 29% license growth, 22% service revenue growth and 8% support revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity in our security portfolio and in our recent acquisitions, right for defiance rapidly. In fact, we gained almost 1 point in market share in the security and vulnerability market. Second quarter operating profit was $154 million or 20.2% of revenue.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG delivered revenue of $9.4 billion, down 9% from the prior year. We have firm traction on the recovery in China and PSG revenue in China was up double digits sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We also gained nearly 2 points a share sequentially in China and have a good mix of new product in the channel.
Across all geographies, however, we continue to see softness in the consumer PC market that offset the strength in commercial clients. By foreign factor, desktop revenue was down 4% and notebook revenue was down 9% year-over-year, both impacted by the consumer. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 23% versus the year-ago quarter.
In commercial, the refresh continues. Commercial Client revenue grew 13%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 28% growth. Segment operating profit totaled $533 million or 5.7% of revenue, up 100 basis point year-over-year as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and product mix.
Moving on to palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. There is a lot of anticipation about the upcoming launch of the touchpad and the build-out of the webOS ecosystem. We remain in the investment phase in terms of completing the software build, working with the developer community on the application ecosystem and making sure that we get the products right. We are on track to ship the touchpad this summer as previously announced. WebOS is a differentiated platform that will redefine the user experience across HP's device solution from consumers to enterprise and from smartphones to tablets and other devices.
The Imaging and Printing business delivered solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 5% to $6.7 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 7% and supplies revenue growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue, while we continue to invest in innovation and growth.
Total printer unit shipments increased 12% with commercial and consumer printer units up 41% and 4%, respectively as we gained market share in laser printer hardware. We are seeing solid momentum in our growth initiatives as we continue to lead the market with innovative new products.
In digital press volume was up 22% year-over-year. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 26% and 60%, respectively while business in unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled.
In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing.
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. The second quarter, financing revenue grew 17% to $885 million. Financing volume increased 14% and net portfolio assets increased 18%. Operating profit of $83 million is up 20% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total growth cash of $12.8 billion. Our second quarter cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 8 days from the year ago period due to higher proportion of sales occurring late in the quarter. In Q2, days sales outstanding increased 10 days from the prior year. Inventories were up 1 day and days payable increased 3 days year-over-year.
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We continue to generate strong cash flow with operating cash flow of $4 billion and free cash flow of $3 billion, each up over 28% from the prior year. During the second quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $5.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
And now a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. We are mindful of our colleagues and business partners that have been affected by the tragedies in Japan and in respect, the courage and resiliency of those who are working to address the situation. Our teams have been working around-the-clock to implement contingency plans are to together with our partners, we are working as quickly as we can to minimize the impacts our channel partners and customers but the situation remains fluid.
We are expecting a temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit due to the events in Japan. We expect revenues to decline due to reduced demand in Japan and certain supply-chain constraints in printing hardware and supply. The total impact will be roughly $700 million of company revenue or about 1% of company revenue in the second half, with about 2/3 of the impact in the third quarter.
In addition to the margin loss in the revenue, there will be incremental costs due to the higher supply chain cost across the company related to securing parts and increased use of air freight and other costs relating to logistics.
We expect the business to recover back to a normal run rate again by the end of the calendar year and we have incorporated these expectations into our revised guidance. Due in part to the expected supply-chain impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as continued softness in consumer PCs, we now expect Q3 revenue of $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion. For the full year, we expect revenue to be $129 billion to $130 billion.
With respect to earnings, keep in mind the following: First, we have revised expectation for the operating profit in the Services business of 13.5% to 14% of revenue in Q3; second, aligning expense of approximately $150 million per quarter; third, a tax rate of approximately 22%; and finally, weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2011 off 2.175 billion.
Thus, we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.08. For the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $5 per share. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

On the one hand, on the commercial side, we see a continuous amount for PCs, 12% growth again, we had are the market leader in this business and we see some weakness on the consumer side.

So we continue to be prudent in our Q3 and our FY '11 revenue outlook. And there's a couple main reasons for that prudence. The first one is that we are expecting the temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit as a result of the events in Japan. We do expect revenues to decline as a result of reduced demand in Japan, as well as certain supply-chain constraints that's in our printing, hardware and supplies business. The total impact for the half is roughly $700 million of revenue, company revenue or about 1% for the half of revenue, and 2/3 of that impact is going to hit in Q3. Then the past quarter, we also saw consumer PC growth or decline more exaggerated than what we had expected when we gave our guidance at the end of Q1 and this continued softness in consumer PCs is now reflected in our revenue guidance. From an EPS standpoint, we factored in both the impact on the revenue guidance and the associated profits as you would expect, it relates to Japan and the PC consumer weakness. And then in addition, we've got incremental supply-chain cuts across the company that are related to securing parts and also the fact that we will increasingly use airfreight as opposed to sea shipments in order to meet customer demands. And then we've also revised our expectation around profitability for our Services business. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you should look at an operating margin in services in Q3 of roughly 13.5% to 14% of revenue and then going into Q4, it should get a bit better."

Really, as we've talked about last quarter, revenue Enterprise Services business has really not grown as fast as it can or should. And as we start new IPO deals, we do defer some of the revenue and costs associated with a data center transformation. But ultimately, there's a mismatch between the revenue and the cost in the early stages of the project and so the margins are significantly depressed in these early phases. And then we've got much of the strong ITO signings have been renewals, which obviously come with additional price concessions and in some cases, additional runoff. The second factor is unfavorable mix, and we talked a little bit about this last quarter as well. But revenue in signings have been heavily weighted to the lower margin ITO business and we have not been ramping up the value-added application services business basically fast enough. And that's why we're making some of these decisions this quarter to reset the margins and make investments. So finally, included in our plan is the continued investment in building our delivery and sales capabilities and also enhancing our portfolio in these higher value-added solutions. An as an example, Application Services business, we will be increasing our bench to the number of people who are available in account to basically sell add-ons, Application Services business and then it will allow us obviously to respond better to customer demand. And this has left us with the sum total of these has left us with higher fixed cost structure than what was expected originally in services and frankly not a very rich margin until some of these ITO deals get through the transformation transition phase."

There's no doubt about that. So we were executing starting as of today. There's a number of things that we have already planned and that we can talk about in our organizational. For example, we have started a search for a VP for services organization. That person with report to me. Ann Livermore is here today with us today as interim Head of Services. Our Technology Services will move together with our ESSN business on the leadership of. We formed a business Solution and Industry Services Group led by 2 very senior executives. The business solution group will be developing industry-specific IP. It will be taken to the market and sold as IP or delivered as a service by the Industry Services Group. So all of these steps are being taken. It has a bit of an impact on the margin, standout line in the second half of this year. And going forward, it is going to be a solid business that will outperform and by the way just to make sure that you'll have a good benchmark even after the reset of the margins, we compare favorably with our main competitors in this business from a margin perspective.

So there is an aspect of the lifecycle cost from where we are in some of the still and how many we've had starting up. There's also an aspect in the ITO market we want to make some additional investments around building out further security capabilities because we have huge demand here. That's an area we'll be investing in with some additional resources and also some of our cloud based services inside ITO. Most of the higher margin additional services we can sell on top of or alongside ITO deals. So that's one area of investments and also some comments on your life cycle point. The other investments are LÃ©o mentioned, investments in our industry focused solutions, both in the services aspects, as well as in some intellectual property we're developing around our industry-based solutions. And then finally, with the Application Services market, that's a big attractive market for us. And we've been performing very well in the applications management art of that market but we have strong customer demand and not enough capability yet today and other aspects of that market. So we're taking some actions to redouble our focus there and make some investments. We've added some new people to the team in terms of the leadership and also investing to have more capabilities and apps modernization and our cloud work around the application space and mobility and things like Business Analytics. So these are resource and capabilities development investments that we're making. And then you also heard the comment that Cathie made about investing in the bench. We actually have 2 tied bench in our Application Services business. We needed more people in the bench, we have customer demand but we couldn't talented the could we do that immediately address that demand. And what we figured out is we actually need to run with a little heavier bench and we no that this is the practice that many of our competitors has allowed us to do more of the short-term signings. So all of those are actions we're taking that I would consider investment in addition to just really where we are in the ITO deal."

All of the actions that we're taking are within the guidance that Cathie has provided for you in terms of the expected revenue and EPS and not just EPS, but operating profit for services. So we've taken into account the amount of time some of these investments and actions takes to ramp in the guidance that you've got. And some of them, of course, provide shorter return than others. In some cases where we're adding resources in the security space, there's immediate demands for these resources so it's a lot shorter return for us in areas like that. So we feel very good about that. We hired a number of people inside our services organization from across the industry over the last year. And when they come into HP they're almost in awe of the portfolio and capabilities we have. And in fact, our surprise by in our Services business, how much capability we've got. What we're talking about now is being able to invest in a lot of the new areas that our competitors don't have a better or stronger position than we have today. Now if you look at the areas like the services we can do around security and the software assets we have, it's a huge differentiation. So 1 of our services areas of differentiation is very closely tied to the technology and applications and IP that HP has inside our software business, inside our products business. So I think that's a very differentiated position that I would stand up against anybody. And it's the combination of the software, assets, those products and the services we can build around them that gives us a very differentiated capability. The other thing we've got is we've got an install base of customers who want to buy more from HP. And are very interested and eager for us to provide these additional services and many of our competitors don't have that. Now we've got an install base who us to provide more services. So I think those are quite differentiated opportunities for HP and particularly the IP that we're developing around the industries and that we have based on our software portfolio is quite differentiated."

When we just gave you 2 good examples for that, one is that Networking, where we see great performance happening and where we outgrew our competition to produce much better products that is significantly better price performance ratio than anyone else and that's why we're winning so much. We're adding innovations there as well with new products, including our flex network software and as we're adding IP to our various businesses, we are creating the differentiation. Let me point another business where we're doing is really well we haven't talked much about today our software business. And we talked about overall growth of the software business, as you know very well, you should measures of their businesses by the growth in us and their we grew by 29%, which shows that once you start growing into differentiated aspect of the business you start to invest in IP you reap the benefit of it.

Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call with LÃ©o Apotheker, HP's CEO; Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Ann Livermore HP's EVP of Enterprise Business. 
Before we get started, I wanted to explain the decision to accelerate the timing of our Q2 earnings announcement. Yesterday afternoon, we became aware of a published media report quoting from an internal HP communication. While that communication did not contain information about HP's second quarter financial performance, we believe that having access to HP's second quarter financial results and fiscal 2011 financial outlook would assist investors in evaluating the information and the media report.
We therefore determined the most prudent course of action under these circumstances was to accelerate our second quarter earnings announcement. Before handing the call over to LÃ©o, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year.

Please refer to the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-Q.
The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Q2 Form 10-Q.
Earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. A comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com.
I will now turn the call over to LÃ©o."

As Steve mentioned, we thought announcing early was the right thing to do given the circumstances. As we discussed in March [ph], the forces of cloud and connectivity are changing the world of technology and creating exciting new opportunities. There are new market realities in this modern world and some companies will pay lip service to change but fail, because they'll be stuck trying to protect their legacy business models. The winners will be companies who not only talk about the future, but also actually involve their strategies and adjust their business accordingly.
At HP, we intend to lead by making the right customer-focused decision to take advantage of the changing technology landscape, and by executing aggressively on our long-term strategy. As always, these decisions need to be balanced with a focus on operational efficiency and prudent financial discipline.
In the second quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute aggressively, make the right decisions for our future and drive operational efficiencies. We achieved solid results, growing revenue 3% and gaining market share in key segments. On a profitability perspective, we expanded those growths in operating margins as we continue to drive a better portfolio mix. We grew non-GAAP EPS 14% versus our last year, and we generated a healthy $4 billion of cash flow from operations in the quarter.
We continue to make investments in the business with new innovations and incremental R&D spend. We launched many new offerings, including the successful launch of cloud systems, flex network and networking end of the year March. Our customers had a very positive response to our strategy laid out in March. They are seeing us make good progress bringing together assets across the company. Cloud systems is a great example where we are leveraging conversion infrastructure, software, security and services to help customers build, manage and consumer cloud services across private clouds, public clouds and traditional IT environments. We have already attracted thousands of customers in our pipeline.
In Q2, we continue to demonstrate strength in our commercial business across the company. Our commercial business, which represents growth of 3/4 of the HP revenue was up 8% year-over-year. ESSN had another solid quarter. We continue to be the worldwide leader in service and our networking business is innovating and steadily taking share and I'm pleased with the improvements being made in our software businesses, which grew total revenues 17% and license revenue 29% versus last year.
IPG executed very well across the board during the quarter, with particular strength in commercial. IPG is working diligently with a Japanese data engine and toner supplier to address anticipated custom and financial impact, resulting from the earthquakes and related events in Japan. More broadly, we're focused on working to minimize the expected supply chain impacts in our fiscal second half. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of those who are working to restore the situation, but HP will not be immune to the impact.
In February, we highlighted 2 specific areas where we needed more attention: consumer PC and services. Since then, we have done a great deal of work in each area, so let me give you an update on where we currently stand. The PC market continues to be bifurcated. On one hand, the commercial PC market remains strong. HP again grew commercial PC revenue double-digits, gaining share sequentially and year-over-year. Our products and go-to-market are very well-positioned to capture the ongoing corporate demand. On the other hand, the consumer PC market has continued to be challenging industry-wise. In Q2, consumer PC revenue declined over 20% year-over-year, even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the statement of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated. We are remaining cautious in the near-term. However, we are excited about the tablet opportunity. You'll be hearing and seeing more from our TouchPad in the weeks and months to come. It will be an exciting product release for HP.
A quick update regarding PSG in China. Throughout industry, we have been very focused on driving our recovery plans. We made good progress in Q2 where we again grew double-digit sequentially. We still have significant headroom to get back the share we lost and we expect our momentum to carry into the second half.
Now let me shift to Services. As I highlighted in March, Services is an important part of HP's long-term strategy, giving us a platform to be more solution-oriented and a better strategic partner with our customers. A significant Services footprint also provides an architectural link with customers. So as customers look to optimize their traditional IT environment, transition to private clouds versus to public clouds or transform to a hybrid model, HP will help implement and manage these capabilities. That said, as I have been digging into our Services business in showing HP and diving even deeper over the past couple of months, I've concluded that we had a solid strategy for Services, but we didn't invest in the path to support a strategy. Instead, HP focused on maximizing a shorter-term margins. 
We have over-executed operationally and under-invested strategically. As a result, our shorter-margin expectations have been too high. This has impacted our ability to create sustainable growth for the long term, in particular we have not yet shifted our Services mix to a higher value, higher margin and higher growth categories. 
You have seen it in our historical results. Our margins have expanded quickly and significantly, but our revenue has not grown as far as it can or should in our mix of ITO Application Services, EPO, MPS has been unchanged over the past several years. The same is true when I look at the recent signage, which have been heavily weighted towards longer-term ITO deals. As the ITO deals our margins are pressured as we ramp headcount faster than revenue during the start-up phase. We want these ITO deals, but our customers are asking us to expand our application and BTO capabilities more quickly. 
Though we have a choice point, HP can continue executing for some time along these same lines or we can improve the value of our Services business by further aligning our service's strategy with the company's strategy. I've decided that we're not going to just talk about our future, we're going to aggressively execute on our strategy and make some immediate changes. 
First, due to the importance of increasing the value of our Enterprise Services business, we have decided to launch a search for an EVP for this business reporting directly to me. Ann Livermore, in addition to her role of EVP for Enterprise Business, will be the interim leader for ES [Enterprise Services]. We also have decided to combine the Technology Services organization with the ESSN organization under Dave Donatelli's leadership. The TS business has made great improvements over the last several years. The next phase is to create greater go-to-market leverage with our products and embed more technology into our products for further automate services.
Second, we will accelerate portfolio investments in higher value-added services. We will deepen industry content and form a business solutions group to create more strategic value for our customers. We will enhance our services' offerings in emerging areas, such as cloud services and consulting, application organization, business analytics and mobility.
Third, we will continue to enhance our delivery and sales capabilities. We will be increasing our bench strength in our Application Services business. We will continue to invest in our sales, business development and delivery capabilities to increase customer satisfaction.
Finally, we will continue to have a tight focus on operational excellence. We will move forward with modernizing our data centers and rationalizing processes, leveraging HP Software. It is my top focus going forward. 
As I've said in my opening remarks, companies need to evolve their strategies, address their business models and execute aggressively to enduring these technologies shifts. This is exactly what we're doing. HP has derived long-term strategy, and I expect that the decisions announced today with our Services business will better align that business through our company strategy, better enable us to meet the needs of our customers and generate a more sustainable return for our shareholders over the long term.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

In the second quarter, HP continues to build on our strategy of delivering cloud and connectivity from consumers to the enterprises. With disciplined execution, we successfully expanded both gross margins and operating margins. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% and generated $4 billion in cash flow from operations. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $31.6 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Commercial hardware was strong across the company, but we still saw weakness in consumer PCs. We had solid performance in industry standard servers, ESS blades and software, double-digit operational growth in networking as it remains a large market opportunity and continued momentum in commercial printing.
By geography, revenue in Asia-Pacific region grew 10% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas grew 2%, or 1% in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 100 basis points from the prior year due to a continued favorable commodity environment, as well as favorable mix from Networking, PSG and Software.
We are investing some of our gross margin improvement back into the business. Total operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs, both of which are expected to enable revenue growth in coming quarters. As we have said before, we actively monitor and evaluate all investments against key milestones, as we work to achieve our objectives and deliver results for shareholders.
Non-GAAP other income and expense yielded a net expense of $76 million due to a more favorable currency impact. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 3% year-on-year to $3.6 billion or 11.3% of revenue. Second quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.24.
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on our cloud division, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure from storage, servers and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew revenue 15% or $5.6 billion. Operating profit grew 1.5x revenue growth or 23% to $756 million for the quarter.
Operating margins of 13.8% was up 90 basis points from the prior year, driven by a favorable product mix and supply-chain savings. Our industry-standard Service business remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 11%. Revenue and Business Critical Systems was up 1.5% year-over-year with strength in nonstop enterprise servers. In addition, customers are responding to the low total cost of ownership and the reliability in our Superdome 2 systems.
In storage, there is tremendous interest in the 3PAR utility storage solutions as customers move to the highly virtualized and dynamically tiered storage arrays, built for public and private cloud computing. 3PAR had another quarter of high double-digit operational revenue growth year-over-year, and we are now selling 3PAR solutions in 23 new countries.
Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 3% from the prior year, with strong growth in our Scalar products and data de-duplication technology, partially offset by lower EVA revenue as some customers wait for the new product refresh this summer.
HP remains #1 in the blade server market and grew ESS blade revenue 20% year-over-year. HP Networking grew 118%, including the acquisition of 3Com, and 14% year-over-year on an operational basis. While our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses, we delivered double-digit growth in our switching and routing business. We saw continued expansion of our proof-of-concept program and our recently launched flex network architecture, significantly outperformed the incumbent equivalent product. 
LÃ©o talked you through some changes we are making to our Services business. But let me provide a bit more color, including the impact to our outlook. HP Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. We delivered operating profit of $1.4 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 50 basis points from the prior year. IT Outsourcing revenue was up 2% year-over-year. The business had good long-term contract signings, driven by renewals and continues to drive healthy double-digit product pull-through.
Application Services made progress in the second quarter, with revenue up 2% year-over-year and some improvement in its short-term project work. Technology Services revenue also grew 2%, and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 6% or up 1%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.
In Q3 of fiscal '11, we expect Services margins to be 13.5% to 14% as a result of lower revenue growth in local currency, unfavorable mix and investments we are making to further enable higher-margin business. For Q4, we expect Services margins to be a bit higher than in Q3. To better position ourselves for the future opportunities, we will need to invest in building value-added services, increasing our bench and building new delivery capabilities for these services.
We expect Services revenues to grow in the low-single digits on a reported basis in fiscal 2011. We are pleased to report the strong performance in HP Software with revenue of $754 million, up 17% compared with the prior year, led by 29% license growth, 22% service revenue growth and 8% support revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity in our security portfolio. And in our recent acquisitions, our sight is to fortify in Stratavia. In fact, we gained almost a point of market share in the security and vulnerability market. Second quarter operating profit was $154 million or 20.2% of revenue.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG delivered revenue of $9.4 billion, down 9% from the prior year. We have firm traction on the recovery in China, and PSG revenue in China was up double digits sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We also gained nearly 2 points a share sequentially in China and have a good mix of new products in the channel.
Across all geographies, however, we continue to see softness in the consumer PC market that offset the strength in commercial clients. By foreign factor, desktop revenue was down 4% and notebook revenue was down 9% year-over-year, both impacted by the consumer. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 23% versus the year-ago quarter.
In commercial, the refresh continues. Commercial Client revenue grew 13%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 28% growth. Segment operating profit totaled $533 million or 5.7% of revenue, up 100 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and product mix.
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. There is a lot of anticipation about the upcoming launch of the TouchPad and the build-out of the webOS ecosystems. We remained in the investment phase in terms of completing the software build, working with the developer community on the application ecosystem and making sure that we get the product right. We are on track to ship the TouchPad this summer as previously announced. webOS is a differentiated platform that will redefine the user experience across HP's device solutions from consumers to enterprise and from smartphones to tablets and other devices.
The Imaging and Printing business delivered solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 5% to $6.7 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 7% and supplies revenue growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue, while we continue to invest in innovation and growth.
Total printer unit shipments increased 12% with commercial and consumer printer units up 41% and 4%, respectively, as we gained market share in laser printer hardware. We are seeing solid momentum in our growth initiatives as we continue to lead the market with innovative new products.
Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22% year-over-year. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 26% and 60% respectively, while business ink unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled.
In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing.
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 17% to $885 million. Financing volume increased 14% and net portfolio assets increased 18%. Operating profit of $83 million is up 20% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total growth cash of $12.8 billion. Our second quarter cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 8 days from the year ago period due to a higher proportion of sales occurring late in the quarter. In Q2, days sales outstanding increased 10 days from the prior year. Inventories were up one day and days payable increased 3 days year-over-year.
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We continue to generate strong cash flow with operating cash flow of $4 billion and free cash flow of $3 billion, each up over 28% from the prior year. During the second quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $5.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
And now a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. We are mindful of our colleagues and business partners that have been affected by the tragedies in Japan. And we respect the courage and resiliency of those who are working to address the situation. Our teams have been working around the clock to implement contingency plans. Together with our partners, we are working as quickly as we can to minimize the impact to our channel partners and customers, but the situation remains fluid.
We are expecting a temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit due to the events in Japan. We expect revenue to decline due to reduced demand in Japan and certain supply chain constraints in printing hardware and supply. The total impact will be roughly $700 million of company revenue or about 1% of company revenue in the second half, with about 2/3 of the impact in the third quarter.
In addition to the margin loss on the revenue, there will be incremental costs due to the higher supply chain cost across the company related to securing parts and increased use of air freight and other costs relating to logistics.
We expect the business to recover back to a normal run rate again by the end of the calendar year, and we have incorporated these expectations into our revised guidance. Due in part to the expected supply chain impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as continued softness in consumer PCs, we now expect Q3 revenue of $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion. For the full year, we expect the revenue to be $129 billion to $130 billion.
With respect to earnings, keep in mind the following: First, we have revised expectation for the operating profit in the Services business of 13.5% to 14% of revenue in Q3; second, aligning expense of approximately $150 million per quarter; third, a tax rate of approximately 22%; and finally, weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2011 off 2.175 billion.
Thus, we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.08. For the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $5 per share. 
With that, we will now open the call to your questions."

It's interesting that you point that PCs. If you look at the performance of PCs, it has a two-faced approach and a two-faced execution. On the one hand on the commercial side, we see a continuous demand for PCs, 12% growth again, we are the market leader in this business and we see some weakness on the consumer side. We believe that we have a great strategy to execute towards our connectivity approach and we are very excited about our TouchPads coming out in particular in the summer. And as the old belief that there will be a convergence of these different form factors over time, TouchPads, PCs, et cetera, and in particular, notebooks, we believe that it's a great opportunity for HP to participate in this.

So we continue to be prudent in our Q3 and our FY '11 revenue outlook. And there's a couple main reasons for that prudence. The first one is that we are expecting this temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit as a result of the events in Japan. We do expect revenue to decline as a result of reduced demand in Japan, as well as certain supply chain constraints that's in our printing, hardware and supplies business. The total impact for the half is roughly $700 million of revenue -- company revenue, or about 1% for the half of revenue, and 2/3 of that impact is going to hit in Q3. Then the past quarter, we also saw consumer PC growth or decline more exaggerated than what we had expected when we gave our guidance at the end of Q1, and this continued softness in consumer PCs is now reflected in our revenue guidance. From an EPS standpoint, we factored in both the impact from the revenue guidance and the associated profits as you would expect it relate to Japan and the PC consumer weakness. And then in addition, we've got incremental supply chain costs across the company that are related to securing parts, and also the fact that we will increasingly use air freight as opposed to sea shipments in order to meet customer demands. And then we've also revised our expectation around the profitability for our Services business. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you should look at an operating margin in Services in Q3 of roughly 13.5% to 14% of revenue and then going into Q4, it should get a bit better."

Really, as we talked about last quarter, revenue in the Enterprise Services business has really not grown as fast as it can or should. And as we start up new ITO deals, we do defer some of the revenue and costs associated with the data center transformation. But ultimately, there's a mismatch between the revenue and the cost in the early stages of the project, and so the margins are significantly depressed in these early phases. And then we've got much of the strong ITO signings have been in the renewals -- had been renewals, which obviously come with additional price concessions, and in some cases, additional runoff. The second factor is unfavorable mix, and we talked a little bit about this last quarter as well. The revenue in signings have been heavily weighted to the lower margin ITO business, and we have not been ramping up the value-added Application Services business basically fast enough. And that's why we're making some of these decisions this quarter to reset the margins and make investments. So finally, included in our plan is the continued investment in building our delivery and sales capability and also enhancing our portfolio in these higher value-added solutions. And as an example, in our Application Services business, we will be increasing our bench of the number of people who are available in account to basically sell add-ons, Application Services business and then it will allow us obviously to respond better to customer demand. And this has left us with -- the sum total of these has really left us with a higher fixed cost structure than what was expected originally in Services, and frankly not a very rich margin until some of these ITO deals get through the transformation and transition phase."

It should have had -- it should have been happening quite some time ago that we would have been -- we should have been moving into this higher value-added businesses than we did in the past like what happened now. There's no doubt about that. So we will execute starting as of today. There's a number of things that we have already planned and that we can talk about in our organizational setup. For example, we have started a search for a new EVP for OEM [ph] services organization. That person will report to me. Ann Livermore is here today as well, will be the interim Head of Services. Our Technology Services will move together with our ESSN business on the leadership of Dave Donatelli. We formed the Business Solution and Industry Services Group led by 2 very senior executives. The Business Solution Group will be developing industry-specific IP. It will be taken to the market and sold as IP or delivered as a service by the Industry Services Group. So all of these steps are being taken. It has a bit of an impact on the margins as Cathie has just outlined in the second half of this year. And going forward, it is going to be a solid business that will outperform, and by the way just to make sure that you all have a good benchmark, even after the reset of the margins, we compare favorably with our main competitors in this business from a margin perspective.

It sounds like these are largely professional services transformations. So your PS business, which is about half of your Services business, feels largely unaffected and organizationally you're actually migrating it so that would be supportive of the fact that it's unaffected. So my sense is you're calling for maybe a 200 or 250 basis point reduction on operating margins on half of your Services profits. So that's about a 500-basis point decline on your professional service ide of the business, which I think probably has single-digit margins today. That seems like a pretty dramatic reset. So one, can you confirm that TS is unaffected and that my interpretation of the reset is indeed the case? And then, perhaps you can -- I'm still not sure whether this is because of deals that you've signed recently that need time to ramp, which doesn't feel like a change or it's because you're going to make substantial investments to the tune of 400 or 500 basis points on a go-forward basis, perhaps you can clarify that."

Let me maybe try to give you some color on what's really happening and then you can draw your own conclusions. The reasons why we're taking actions is not because we can't continue driving the business as it is today. We could probably do this for a certain number of quarters going forward, and then we will probably be sitting here with a business that is running out of steam, and it's certainly not something we intend to do. So we are taking action to align our Services business model to our long-term enterprise strategy. And we want to offer our customers higher value-added solutions and we want to help them migrate to and manage a hybrid clouds versus traditional environment. Our current Enterprise Services mix is weighted to slow growing and just on that slow growing and relatively lower margin areas of the services markets. And we need to add some higher IP and intellectual capital content and weed to increase the automation using our HP technology so that if we do all of this, we expect to change the mix of our Services business to a faster growing and higher margin areas of the services market. And if we do all of this then we will position this business well, we will grow it at or above markets while delivering unprecedented value to our customers and better return for our shareholders.

So there is an aspect that there's a life cycle cost for where we are on some of these deals and how many we've had starting up. There's also an aspect in the ITO market.

And those is a higher margin additional services we can sell on top of or alongside ITO deals. So that's one area of investment and also some comments on your life cycle point. The other investments are, LÃ©o mentioned investments in our industry-focused solutions, both in the Services aspects, as well as in some intellectual property we're developing around our industry-based solutions. And then finally, with the Application Services market, that's a big attractive market for us. And we've been performing very well in the applications management part of that market, but we had strong customer demand and not enough capability yet today in other aspects of that market. So we're taking some actions to redouble our focus there and make some investments in it. We've added some new people to the team in terms of the leadership and we're also investing to have more capabilities and apps modernization and our cloud work around the application space and mobility and things like Business Analytics. So these are our resource and capability development investments that we're making. And then you also heard the comment that Cathie made about investing in the bench. We actually had too tight a bench in our Application Services business. We needed more people on the bench. We had customer demand, but we couldn't sell into it because it couldn't immediately address that demand. And what we figured out was we actually need to run with a little heavier bench, and we know that this is the practice that many of our competitors do that allow us to do more of the short-term signings. So all of those are actions we're taking that I would consider investments in addition to just where we are in the ITO deal."

All of the actions that we're taking are within the guidance that Cathie's provided for you in terms of expected revenue and EPS, and not just EPS, but operating profit for Services. So we've taken into account the amount of time some of these investments and actions take to ramp in the guidance that you've got. And some of them, of course, provide shorter return than others. In some cases where we're adding resources in the security space, there's immediate demand for those resources, so it's a lot shorter return for us in areas like that. So we feel very good about that. We've hired a number of people inside our services organization from across the industry over the last year. And when they come into HP they're almost in awe of the portfolio and capabilities we have. And in fact, our surprise by in our Services business, how much capability we've got. What we are talking about now is being able to invest in a lot of the new areas that our competitors don't have a better or stronger position than we have today. Now if you look at the areas like the services we can do around security and the software assets we have, it's a huge differentiation. So one of our services areas of differentiation is very closely tied to the technology and applications and IP that HP has inside our Software business, inside our Products business. So I think that's a very differentiated position that I would stand up against anybody. And it's the combination of the software, assets, those products and the services we can build around them that gives us a very differentiated capability. The other thing we've got is we've got an install base of customers who want to buy more from HP and are very interested and eager for us to provide these additional services and many of our competitors don't have that. Now we've got an install base who want us to provide more of these services. So I think those are quite differentiated opportunities for HP and particularly the IP that we're developing around the industries and that we have based on our software portfolio is quite differentiated."

Let me just gave you 2 good examples for that. One is Networking where we see great performance happening and where we outgrew our competition to produce much better product that is significantly better price performance ratio than anyone else, and that's why we're winning so much. We're adding a lot of innovation there as well with new products, including our flex network software. And as we're adding IP to our various businesses, we are creating the differentiation. Let me point out another business where we're doing extremely well that hasn't been talked about too much today, our Software business. And while we talk about the overall growth of the Software business, as you know very well, you should measure Software businesses by the growth in licenses, and there we grew by 29%, which shows that once you start growing into differentiated aspects of the business, you start to invest in IP, you reap the benefits of it.

Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call with LÃ©o Apotheker, HP's CEO; Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Ann Livermore HP's EVP of Enterprise Business. 
Before we get started, I wanted to explain the decision to accelerate the timing of our Q2 earnings announcement. Yesterday afternoon, we became aware of a published media report quoting from an internal HP communication. While that communication did not contain information about HP's second quarter financial performance, we believe that having access to HP's second quarter financial results and fiscal 2011 financial outlook would assist investors in evaluating the information and the media report.
We therefore determined the most prudent course of action under these circumstances was to accelerate our second quarter earnings announcement. Before handing the call over to LÃ©o, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year.
In addition, Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. Please refer to the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-Q.
The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Q2 Form 10-Q.
Earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. A comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com.
I will now turn the call over to LÃ©o."

As Steve mentioned, we thought announcing early was the right thing to do given the circumstances. As we discussed around March 7, 2011, the forces of cloud and connectivity are changing the world of technology and creating exciting new opportunities. There are new market realities in this evolving world and some companies will pay lip service to change but fail, because they'll be stuck trying to protect their legacy business models. The winners will be companies who not only talk about the future, but also actually evolve their strategies and adjust their business accordingly.
At HP, we intend to lead by making the right customer-focused decisions to take advantage of the changing technology landscape, and by executing aggressively on our long-term strategy. As always, these decisions need to be balanced with a focus on operational efficiency and prudent financial discipline.
In the second quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute aggressively, make the right decisions for our future and drive operational efficiencies. We achieved solid results, growing revenue 3% and gaining market share in key segments. On a profitability perspective, we expanded those growths in operating margins as we continue to drive a better portfolio mix. We grew non-GAAP EPS 14% versus last year, and we generated a healthy $4 billion of cash flow from operations in the quarter.
We continue to make investments in the business with new innovations and incremental R&D spend. We launched many new offerings, including the successful launch of cloud systems, flex network and networking end of the year March. Our customers had a very positive response to our strategy laid out in March. They are seeing us make good progress bringing together assets across the company. Cloud systems is a great example where we are leveraging conversion infrastructure, software, security and services to help customers build, manage and consume cloud services across private clouds, public clouds and traditional IT environments. We have already attracted thousands of customers in our pipeline.
In Q2, we continue to demonstrate strength in our commercial business across the company. Our commercial business, which represents growth of 3/4 of the HP revenue was up 8% year-over-year. ESSN had another solid quarter. We continue to be the worldwide leader in service and our networking business is innovating and steadily taking share and I'm pleased with the improvements being made in our software businesses, which grew total revenues 17% and license revenue 29% versus last year.
IPG executed very well across the board during the quarter, with particular strength in commercial. IPG is working diligently with a Japanese data engine and toner supplier to address anticipated custom and financial impact, resulting from the earthquakes and related events in Japan. More broadly, we're focused on working to minimize the expected supply chain impacts in our fiscal second half. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of those who are working to restore the situation, but HP will not be immune to the impact.
In February, we highlighted 2 specific areas where we needed more attention: consumer PC and services. Since then, we have done a great deal of work in each area, so let me give you an update on where we currently stand. The PC market continues to be bifurcated. On one hand, the commercial PC market remains strong. HP again grew commercial PC revenue double-digits, gaining share sequentially and year-over-year. Our products and go-to-market are very well-positioned to capture the ongoing corporate demand. On the other hand, the consumer PC market has continued to be challenging industry-wise. In Q2, consumer PC revenue declined over 20% year-over-year, even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the statement of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated. We are remaining cautious in the near-term. However, we are excited about the tablet opportunity. You'll be hearing and seeing more from our TouchPad in the weeks and months to come. It will be an exciting product release for HP.
A quick update regarding PSG in China. Scott and his team have been very focused on driving our recovery plans. We made good progress in Q2 where we again grew double-digit sequentially. We still have significant headroom to get back the share we lost and we expect our momentum to carry into the second half.
Now let me shift to Services. As I highlighted in March, Services is an important part of HP's long-term strategy, giving us a platform to be more solution-oriented and a better strategic partner with our customers. A significant Services footprint also provides an architectural link with customers. So as customers look to optimize their traditional IT environment, transition to private clouds versus to public clouds or transform to a hybrid model, HP will help implement and manage these capabilities. That said, as I have been digging into our Services business since joining HP and diving even deeper over the past couple of months, I've concluded that we had a solid strategy for Services, but we didn't invest in the path to support a strategy. Instead, HP focused on maximizing its shorter-term margins. 
We have over-executed operationally and under-invested strategically. As a result, our short-term margin expectations have been too high. This has impacted our ability to create sustainable growth for the long term, in particular we have not yet shifted our Services mix to a higher value, higher margin and higher growth categories. 
You have seen it in our historical results. Our margins have expanded quickly and significantly, but our revenue has not grown as far as it can or should in our mix of ITO Application Services, EPO, MPS has been unchanged over the past several years. The same is true when I look at the recent signings, which have been heavily weighted towards longer-term ITO deals. As we add ITO deals our margins are pressured as we ramp headcount faster than revenue during the start-up phase. We want these ITO deals, but our customers are asking us to expand our application and BTO capabilities more quickly. 
Though we have a choice point, HP can continue executing for some time along these same lines or we can improve the value of our Services business by further aligning our Services strategy with the company's strategy. I've decided that we're not going to just talk about our future, we're going to aggressively execute on our strategy and make some immediate changes. 
First, due to the importance of increasing the value of our Enterprise Services business, we have decided to launch a search for an EVP for this business reporting directly to me. Ann Livermore, in addition to her role of EVP for Enterprise Business, will be the interim leader for ES [Enterprise Services]. We also have decided to combine the Technology Services organization with the ESSN organization under Dave Donatelli's leadership. The TS business has made great improvements over the last several years. The next phase is to create greater go-to-market leverage with our products and embed more technology into our products to further automate services.
Second, we will accelerate portfolio investments in higher value-added services. We will deepen industry content and form a business solutions group to create more strategic value for our customers. We will enhance our Services offerings in emerging areas, such as cloud services and consulting, application organization, business analytics and mobility.
Third, we will continue to enhance our delivery and sales capabilities. We will be increasing our bench strength in our Application Services business. We will continue to invest in our sales, business development and delivery capabilities to increase customer satisfaction.
Finally, we will continue to have a tight focus on operational excellence. We will move forward with modernizing our data centers and rationalizing processes, leveraging HP Software. It is my top focus going forward. 
As I've said in my opening remarks, companies need to evolve their strategies, address their business models and execute aggressively to enduring these technologies shifts. This is exactly what we're doing. HP has the right long-term strategy, and I expect that the decisions announced today with our Services business will better align that business to our company strategy, better enable us to meet the needs of our customers and generate a more sustainable return for our shareholders over the long term.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

In the second quarter, HP continues to build on our strategy of delivering cloud and connectivity from consumers to the enterprises. With disciplined execution, we successfully expanded both gross margins and operating margins. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% and generated $4 billion in cash flow from operations. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $31.6 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Commercial hardware was strong across the company, but we still saw weakness in consumer PCs. We had solid performance in industry standard servers, ESS blades and software, double-digit operational growth in networking as it remains a large market opportunity and continued momentum in commercial printing.
By geography, revenue in Asia-Pacific region grew 10% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas grew 2%, or 1% in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 100 basis points from the prior year due to a continued favorable commodity environment, as well as favorable mix from Networking, PSG and Software.
We are investing some of our gross margin improvement back into the business. Total operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs, both of which are expected to enable revenue growth in coming quarters. As we have said before, we actively monitor and evaluate all investments against key milestones, as we work to achieve our objectives and deliver results for shareholders.
Non-GAAP other income and expense yielded a net expense of $76 million due to a more favorable currency impact. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 3% year-on-year to $3.6 billion or 11.3% of revenue. Second quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.24.
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on our cloud vision, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure from storage, servers and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew revenue 15% to $5.6 billion. Operating profit grew 1.5x revenue growth or 23% to $756 million for the quarter.
Operating margin of 13.8% was up 90 basis points from the prior year, driven by a favorable product mix and supply-chain savings. Our industry-standard Service business remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 11%. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was up 1.5% year-over-year with strength in nonstop enterprise servers. In addition, customers are responding to the low total cost of ownership and the reliability in our Superdome 2 systems.
In storage, there is tremendous interest in the 3PAR utility storage solutions as customers move to the highly virtualized and dynamically tiered storage arrays, built for public and private cloud computing. 3PAR had another quarter of high double-digit operational revenue growth year-over-year, and we are now selling 3PAR solutions in 23 new countries.
Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 3% from the prior year, with strong growth in our Scalar products and data de-duplication technology, partially offset by lower EVA revenue as some customers wait for the new product refresh this summer.
HP remains #1 in the blade server market and grew ESS blade revenue 20% year-over-year. HP Networking grew 118%, including the acquisition of 3Com, and 14% year-over-year on an operational basis. While our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses, we delivered double-digit growth in our switching and routing business. We saw continued expansion of our proof-of-concept program and our recently launched flex network architecture, significantly outperformed the incumbent equivalent product. 
LÃ©o talked you through some changes we are making to our Services business. But let me provide a bit more color, including the impact to our outlook. HP Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. We delivered operating profit of $1.4 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 60 basis points from the prior year. IT Outsourcing revenue was up 2% year-over-year. The business had good long-term contract signings, driven by renewals and continues to drive healthy double-digit product pull-through.
Application Services made progress in the second quarter, with revenue up 2% year-over-year and some improvement in its short-term project work. Technology Services revenue also grew 2%, and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 6% or up 1%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.
In Q3 of fiscal '11, we expect Services margins to be 13.5% to 14% as a result of lower revenue growth in local currency, unfavorable mix and investments we are making to further enable higher-margin business. For Q4, we expect Services margins to be a bit higher than in Q3. To better position ourselves for the future opportunities, we will need to invest in building value-added services, increasing our bench and building new delivery capabilities for these services.
We expect Services revenues to grow in the low-single digits on a reported basis in fiscal 2011. We are pleased to report the strong performance in HP Software with revenue of $764 million, up 17% compared with the prior year, led by 29% license growth, 22% service revenue growth and 8% support revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity in our security portfolio. And in our recent acquisitions, ArcSight, Fortify and Stratavia. In fact, we gained almost a point of market share in the security and vulnerability market. Second quarter operating profit was $154 million or 20.2% of revenue.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG delivered revenue of $9.4 billion, down 5% from the prior year. We have firm traction on the recovery in China, and PSG revenue in China was up double digits sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We also gained nearly 2 points a share sequentially in China and have a good mix of new products in the channel.
Across all geographies, however, we continue to see softness in the consumer PC market that offset the strength in commercial clients. By form factor, desktop revenue was down 4% and notebook revenue was down 9% year-over-year, both impacted by the consumer. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 23% versus the year-ago quarter.
In commercial, the refresh continues. Commercial Client revenue grew 13%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 28% growth. Segment operating profit totaled $533 million or 5.7% of revenue, up 100 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and product mix.
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. There is a lot of anticipation about the upcoming launch of the TouchPad and the build-out of the webOS ecosystems. We remained in the investment phase in terms of completing the software build, working with the developer community on the application ecosystem and making sure that we get the product right. We are on track to ship the TouchPad this summer as previously announced. webOS is a differentiated platform that will redefine the user experience across HP's device solutions from consumers to enterprise and from smartphones to tablets and other devices.
The Imaging and Printing business delivered solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 5% to $6.7 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 7% and supplies revenue growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue, while we continue to invest in innovation and growth.
Total printer unit shipments increased 12% with commercial and consumer printer units up 41% and 4%, respectively, as we gained market share in laser printer hardware. We are seeing solid momentum in our growth initiatives as we continue to lead the market with innovative new products.
Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22% year-over-year. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 26% and 60% respectively, while business ink unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled.
In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing.
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 17% to $885 million. Financing volume increased 14% and net portfolio assets increased 18%. Operating profit of $83 million is up 20% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total growth cash of $12.8 billion. Our second quarter cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 8 days from the year ago period due to a higher proportion of sales occurring late in the quarter. In Q2, days sales outstanding increased 10 days from the prior year. Inventories were up one day and days payable increased 3 days year-over-year.
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We continue to generate strong cash flow with operating cash flow of $4 billion and free cash flow of $3 billion, each up over 28% from the prior year. During the second quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $5.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
And now a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. We are mindful of our colleagues and business partners that have been affected by the tragedies in Japan. And we respect the courage and resiliency of those who are working to address the situation. Our teams have been working around the clock to implement contingency plans. Together with our partners, we are working as quickly as we can to minimize the impact to our channel partners and customers, but the situation remains fluid.
We are expecting a temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit due to the events in Japan. We expect revenue to decline due to reduced demand in Japan and certain supply chain constraints in printing hardware and supplies. The total impact will be roughly $700 million of company revenue or about 1% of company revenue in the second half, with about 2/3 of the impact in the third quarter.
In addition to the margin loss on the revenue, there will be incremental costs due to the higher supply chain cost across the company related to securing parts and increased use of air freight and other costs relating to logistics.
We expect the business to recover back to a normal run rate by the end of the calendar year, and we have incorporated these expectations into our revised guidance. Due in part to the expected supply chain impact from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as continued softness in consumer PCs, we now expect Q3 revenue of $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion. For the full year, we expect the revenue to be $129 billion to $130 billion.
With respect to earnings, keep in mind the following: First, we have revised expectations for the operating profit in the Services business of 13.5% to 14% of revenue in Q3; second, aligning expense of approximately $150 million per quarter; third, a tax rate of approximately 22%; and finally, weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2011 of 2.175 billion.
Thus, we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.08. For the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $5 per share. 
With that, we will now open the call to your questions."

On the one hand on the commercial side, we see a continuous demand for PCs, 12% growth again, we are the market leader in this business and we see some weakness on the consumer side. We believe that we have a great strategy to execute towards our connectivity approach and we are very excited about our TouchPads coming out in particular in the summer. And as the old belief that there will be a convergence of these different form factors over time, TouchPads, PCs, et cetera, and in particular, notebooks, we believe that it's a great opportunity for HP to participate in this.

So we continue to be prudent in our Q3 and our FY '11 revenue outlook. And there's a couple main reasons for that prudence. The first one is that we are expecting this temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit as a result of the events in Japan. We do expect revenue to decline as a result of reduced demand in Japan, as well as certain supply chain constraints that's in our printing, hardware and supplies business. The total impact for the half is roughly $700 million of revenue -- company revenue, or about 1% for the half of revenue, and 2/3 of that impact is going to hit in Q3. Then the past quarter, we also saw consumer PC growth or decline more exaggerated than what we had expected when we gave our guidance at the end of Q1, and this continued softness in consumer PCs is now reflected in our revenue guidance. From an EPS standpoint, we factored in both the impact from the revenue guidance and the associated profits as you would expect that relate to Japan and the PC consumer weakness. And then in addition, we've got incremental supply chain costs across the company that are related to securing parts, and also the fact that we will increasingly use air freight as opposed to sea shipments in order to meet customer demands. And then we've also revised our expectation around the profitability for our Services business. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you should look at an operating margin in Services in Q3 of roughly 13.5% to 14% of revenue and then going into Q4, it should get a bit better."

Really, as we talked about last quarter, revenue in the Enterprise Services business has really not grown as fast as it can or should. And as we start up new ITO deals, we do defer some of the revenue and costs associated with the data center transformation. But ultimately, there's a mismatch between the revenue and the cost in the early stages of the project, and so the margins are significantly depressed in these early phases. And then we've got much of the strong ITO signings have been in the renewals -- had been renewals, which obviously come with additional price concessions, and in some cases, additional runoff. The second factor is unfavorable mix, and we talked a little bit about this last quarter as well. The revenue in signings have been heavily weighted to the lower margin ITO business, and we have not been ramping up the value-added Application Services business basically fast enough. And that's why we're making some of these decisions this quarter to reset the margins and make investments. So finally, included in our plan is the continued investment in building our delivery and sales capability and also enhancing our portfolio in these higher value-added solutions. And as an example, in our Application Services business, we will be increasing our bench of the number of people who are available in account to basically sell add-ons, Application Services business and then it will allow us obviously to respond better to customer demand. And this has left us with -- the sum total of these has really left us with a higher fixed cost structure than what was expected originally in Services, and frankly not a very rich margin until some of these ITO deals get through the transformation and transition phase."

As you can see, we are about to engage in a significant transformation of the Services business, and to be talking candid with you, in fact, we are now going to execute the strategy that were outlined on the Services business years ago. It should have had -- it should have been happening quite some time ago that we would have been -- we should have been moving into this higher value-added businesses than  did occur in the past. It will happen now. There's no doubt about that. So we will execute starting as of today. There's a number of things that we have already planned and that we can talk about in our organizational setup. For example, we have started a search for a new EVP for OEM Services organization. That person will report to me. Ann Livermore is here today as well, will be the interim Head of Services. Our Technology Services will move together with our ESSN business under the leadership of Dave Donatelli. We formed the Business Solution and Industry Services Group led by 2 very senior executives. The Business Solution Group will be developing industry-specific IP. It will be taken to the market and sold as IP or delivered as a service by the Industry Services Group. So all of these steps are being taken. It has a bit of an impact on the margins as Cathie has just outlined in the second half of this year. And going forward, it is going to be a solid business that will perform, and by the way just to make sure that you all have a good benchmark, even after the reset of the margins, we compare favorably with our main competitors in this business from a margin perspective. And going forward, our Services business in particular as of FY '12, will be a solid strong additive business to our mix and we look forward to see the value that is going is going to be generated there."

It sounds like these are largely professional services transformations. So your PS business, which is about half of your Services business, feels largely unaffected and organizationally you're actually migrating it so that would be supportive of the fact that it's unaffected. So my sense is you're calling for maybe a 200 or 250 basis point reduction on operating margins on half of your Services profits. So that's about a 500-basis point decline on your professional services side of the business, which I think probably has single-digit margins today. That seems like a pretty dramatic reset. So one, can you confirm that TS is unaffected and that my interpretation of the reset is indeed the case? And then, perhaps you can -- I'm still not sure whether this is because of deals that you've signed recently that need time to ramp, which doesn't feel like a change or it's because you're going to make substantial investments to the tune of 400 or 500 basis points on a go-forward basis, perhaps you can clarify that."

So we are taking action to align our Services business model to our long-term enterprise strategy. And we want to offer our customers higher value-added solutions and we want to help them migrate to and manage a hybrid cloud versus traditional environment. Our current Enterprise Services mix is weighted to slow growing and just on that slow growing and relatively lower margin areas of the services markets. And we need to add some higher IP and intellectual capital content and need to increase the automation using our HP technology so that if we do all of this, we expect to change the mix of our Services business to a faster growing and higher margin areas of the services market. And if we do all of this then we will position this business well, we will grow it at or above markets while delivering unprecedented value to our customers and better return for our shareholders.

So there is an aspect that there's a life cycle cost for where we are on some of these deals and how many we've had starting up. There's also an aspect in the ITO market. We want to make some additional investments around building out further security capabilities because we have huge demand here. That's an area we'll be investing in with some additional resources and also some of our cloud-based services inside ITO. And those are the higher margin additional services we can sell on top of or alongside ITO deals. So that's one area of investment and also some comments on your life cycle point. The other investments are, LÃ©o mentioned investments in our industry-focused solutions, both in the Services aspects, as well as in some intellectual property we're developing around our industry-based solutions. And then finally, with the Application Services market, that's a big attractive market for us. And we've been performing very well in the applications management part of that market, but we had strong customer demand and not enough capability yet today in other aspects of that market. So we're taking some actions to redouble our focus there and make some investments in it. We've added some new people to the team in terms of the leadership and we're also investing to have more capabilities and apps modernization and our cloud work around the application space and mobility and things like Business Analytics. So these are our resource and capability development investments that we're making. And then you also heard the comment that Cathie made about investing in the bench. We actually had too tight a bench in our Application Services business. We needed more people on the bench. We had customer demand, but we couldn't sell into it because it couldn't immediately address that demand. And what we figured out was we actually need to run with a little heavier bench, and we know that this is the practice that many of our competitors do that allow us to do more of the short-term signings.

All of the actions that we're taking are within the guidance that Cathie's provided for you in terms of expected revenue and EPS, and not just EPS, but operating profit for Services. So we've taken into account the amount of time some of these investments and actions take to ramp in the guidance that you've got. And some of them, of course, provide shorter return than others. In some cases where we're adding resources in the security space, there's immediate demand for those resources, so it's a lot shorter return for us in areas like that. So we feel very good about that. We've hired a number of people inside our services organization from across the industry over the last year. And when they come into HP they're almost in awe of the portfolio and capabilities we have. And in fact, are surprised by in our Services business, how much capability we have. What we are talking about now is being able to invest in a lot of the new areas that our competitors don't have a better or stronger position than we have today. Now if you look at the areas like the services we can do around security and the software assets we have, it's a huge differentiation. So one of our services areas of differentiation is very closely tied to the technology and applications and IP that HP has inside our Software business, inside our Products business. So I think that's a very differentiated position that I would stand up against anybody. And it's the combination of the software assets, those products and the services we can build around them that gives us a very differentiated capability. The other thing we've got is we've got an installed base of customers who want to buy more from HP and are very interested and eager for us to provide these additional services and many of our competitors don't have that. Now we've got an installed base who want us to provide more of these services.

Let me just gave you 2 good examples for that. One is Networking where we see great performance happening and where we outgrew our competition to produce much better product that is significantly better price performance ratio than anyone else, and that's why we're winning so much. We're adding a lot of innovation there as well with new products, including our flex network software. And as we're adding IP to our various businesses, we are creating the differentiation. Let me point out another business where we're doing extremely well that hasn't been talked about too much today, our Software business. And while we talk about the overall growth of the Software business, as you know very well, you should measure Software businesses by the growth in licenses, and there we grew by 29%, which shows that once you start going into differentiated aspects of the business, you start to invest in IP, you reap the benefits of it. So overall, I think we were aligned."

In terms of the non-labor investments or actions that we took, including data center consolidations and network rationalizations, we're a bit ahead of plan. On the labor side, we are a bit behind in the plan. And what we're doing is we are evaluating migrations, basically contract-by-contract to make sure that we're getting the right return on those migrations and this is taking longer than we had originally intended.

So it looks like you're anticipating just a one quarter reset, followed by business as usual. I understand Japan is temporary and maybe some of the improvement in the October quarter is due to less of a drag from Japan, but what gives you the confidence that beyond the July quarter, it'll be business as usual, given what appears to be more of a multi-quarter transformation in the Services business where you don't even have a leader in place to set the direction? And I realize you're not guiding for next year, but back to Keith's question, as you think about the Services business next year, are you assuming that it grows low-single digits in line with your long-term trends? And are you assuming margins will be no worse than the 13.5% to 14% you talked about today?"

First of all, we reconfirm the target we set out for ourselves during the summit of $7 EPS for FY '14. We maintain that target. And the reason why we believe we will achieve this is, among others, the investments we're making today in the Services business. The Services business can be leveraged in particular as I mentioned before through our IP. And we will need to add IP to our Services business, on the one hand as IP, and on the other hand as intellectual capital that differentiates ourselves from others. I believe that we can achieve this over the next coming quarters, and we have the delivery capability and the sales capability to bring this successfully to the customers. There is demand out there. It dovetails really well  with our cloud strategy and the huge demand that we see in the market for cloud migrations, cloud adoptions and cloud transformations. So we are dovetailing into this. We are also generating new revenue streams. I mentioned software earlier on, there are others that are coming, so I believe we are well-positioned. And as we're making these changes today, we will be able to capture the wave to more in FY '12 and we will be able to discuss this in much greater detail when we meet in September for the Analyst Meeting."

Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call with LÃ©o Apotheker, HP's CEO; Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Ann Livermore HP's EVP of Enterprise Business. 
Before we get started, I wanted to explain the decision to accelerate the timing of our Q2 earnings announcement. Yesterday afternoon, we became aware of a published media report quoting from an internal HP communication. While that communication did not contain information about HP's second quarter financial performance, we believe that having access to HP's second quarter financial results and fiscal 2011 financial outlook would assist investors in evaluating the information and the media report.
We therefore determined the most prudent course of action under these circumstances was to accelerate our second quarter earnings announcement. Before handing the call over to LÃ©o, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year.
In addition, some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. Please refer to the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-Q.
The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Q2 Form 10-Q.
Earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. A comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com.
I will now turn the call over to LÃ©o."

As Steve mentioned, we thought announcing early was the right thing to do given the circumstances. As we discussed around March 7, 2011, the forces of cloud and connectivity are changing the world of technology and creating exciting new opportunities. There are new market realities in this evolving world and some companies will pay lip service to change but fail, because they'll be stuck trying to protect their legacy business models. The winners will be companies who not only talk about the future, but also actually evolve their strategies and adjust their business accordingly.
At HP, we intend to lead by making the right customer-focused decisions to take advantage of the changing technology landscape, and by executing aggressively on our long-term strategy. As always, these decisions need to be balanced with a focus on operational efficiency and prudent financial discipline.
In the second quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute aggressively, make the right decisions for our future and drive operational efficiencies. We achieved solid results, growing revenue 3% and gaining market share in key segments. On a profitability perspective, we expanded those growths in operating margins as we continue to drive a better portfolio mix. We grew non-GAAP EPS 14% versus last year, and we generated a healthy $4 billion of cash flow from operations in the quarter.
We continue to make investments in the business with new innovations and incremental R&D spend. We launched many new offerings, including the successful launch of cloud systems, flex network and networking end of the year March. Our customers had a very positive response to our strategy laid out in March. They are seeing us make good progress bringing together assets across the company. Cloud systems is a great example where we are leveraging conversion infrastructure, software, security and services to help customers build, manage and consume cloud services across private clouds, public clouds and traditional IT environments. We have already attracted thousands of customers in our pipeline.
In Q2, we continue to demonstrate strength in our commercial business across the company. Our commercial business, which represents growth of 3/4 of the HP revenue was up 8% year-over-year. ESSN had another solid quarter. We continue to be the worldwide leader in service and our networking business is innovating and steadily taking share and I'm pleased with the improvements being made in our software businesses, which grew total revenues 17% and license revenue 29% versus last year.
IPG executed very well across the board during the quarter, with particular strength in commercial. IPG is working diligently with a Japanese data engine and toner supplier to address anticipated custom and financial impact, resulting from the earthquakes and related events in Japan. More broadly, we're focused on working to minimize the expected supply chain impacts in our fiscal second half. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of those who are working to restore the situation, but HP will not be immune to the impact.
In February, we highlighted 2 specific areas where we needed more attention: consumer PC and services. Since then, we have done a great deal of work in each area, so let me give you an update on where we currently stand. The PC market continues to be bifurcated. On one hand, the commercial PC market remains strong. HP again grew commercial PC revenue double-digits, gaining share sequentially and year-over-year. Our products and go-to-market are very well-positioned to capture the ongoing corporate demand. On the other hand, the consumer PC market has continued to be challenging industry-wise. In Q2, consumer PC revenue declined over 20% year-over-year, even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the statement of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated. We are remaining cautious in the near-term. However, we are excited about the tablet opportunity. You'll be hearing and seeing more from our TouchPad in the weeks and months to come. It will be an exciting product release for HP.
A quick update regarding PSG in China. Scott and his team have been very focused on driving our recovery plans. We made good progress in Q2 where we again grew double-digit sequentially. We still have significant headroom to get back the share we lost and we expect our momentum to carry into the second half.
Now let me shift to Services. As I highlighted in March, Services is an important part of HP's long-term strategy, giving us a platform to be more solution-oriented and a better strategic partner with our customers. A significant Services footprint also provides an architectural link with customers. So as customers look to optimize their traditional IT environment, transition to private clouds versus to public clouds or transform to a hybrid model, HP will help implement and manage these capabilities. That said, as I have been digging into our Services business since joining HP and diving even deeper over the past couple of months, I've concluded that we had a solid strategy for Services, but we didn't invest in the path to support a strategy. Instead, HP focused on maximizing its shorter-term margins. 
We have over-executed operationally and under-invested strategically. As a result, our short-term margin expectations have been too high. This has impacted our ability to create sustainable growth for the long term, in particular we have not yet shifted our Services mix to a higher value, higher margin and higher growth categories. 
You have seen it in our historical results. Our margins have expanded quickly and significantly, but our revenue has not grown as far as it can or should in our mix of ITO Application Services, EPO, MPS has been unchanged over the past several years. The same is true when I look at the recent signings, which have been heavily weighted towards longer-term ITO deals. As we add ITO deals our margins are pressured as we ramp headcount faster than revenue during the start-up phase. We want these ITO deals, but our customers are asking us to expand our application and BTO capabilities more quickly. 
Though we have a choice point, HP can continue executing for some time along these same lines or we can improve the value of our Services business by further aligning our Services strategy with the company's strategy. I've decided that we're not going to just talk about our future, we're going to aggressively execute on our strategy and make some immediate changes. 
First, due to the importance of increasing the value of our Enterprise Services business, we have decided to launch a search for an EVP for this business reporting directly to me. Ann Livermore, in addition to her role of EVP for Enterprise Business, will be the interim leader for ES [Enterprise Services]. We also have decided to combine the Technology Services organization with the ESSN organization under Dave Donatelli's leadership. The TS business has made great improvements over the last several years. The next phase is to create greater go-to-market leverage with our products and embed more technology into our products to further automate services.
Second, we will accelerate portfolio investments in higher value-added services. We will deepen industry content and form a business solutions group to create more strategic value for our customers. We will enhance our Services offerings in emerging areas, such as cloud services and consulting, application organization, business analytics and mobility.
Third, we will continue to enhance our delivery and sales capabilities. We will be increasing our bench strength in our Application Services business. We will continue to invest in our sales, business development and delivery capabilities to increase customer satisfaction.
Finally, we will continue to have a tight focus on operational excellence. We will move forward with modernizing our data centers and rationalizing processes, leveraging HP Software. It is my top focus going forward. 
As I've said in my opening remarks, companies need to evolve their strategies, address their business models and execute aggressively to enduring these technologies shifts. This is exactly what we're doing. HP has the right long-term strategy, and I expect that the decisions announced today with our Services business will better align that business to our company strategy, better enable us to meet the needs of our customers and generate a more sustainable return for our shareholders over the long term.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

In the second quarter, HP continues to build on our strategy of delivering cloud and connectivity from consumers to the enterprises. With disciplined execution, we successfully expanded both gross margins and operating margins. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% and generated $4 billion in cash flow from operations. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $31.6 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Commercial hardware was strong across the company, but we still saw weakness in consumer PCs. We had solid performance in industry standard servers, ESS blades and software, double-digit operational growth in networking as it remains a large market opportunity and continued momentum in commercial printing.
By geography, revenue in Asia-Pacific region grew 10% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas grew 2%, or 1% in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 100 basis points from the prior year due to a continued favorable commodity environment, as well as favorable mix from Networking, PSG and Software.
We are investing some of our gross margin improvement back into the business. Total operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs, both of which are expected to enable revenue growth in coming quarters. As we have said before, we actively monitor and evaluate all investments against key milestones, as we work to achieve our objectives and deliver results for shareholders.
Non-GAAP other income and expense yielded a net expense of $76 million due to a more favorable currency impact. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 3% year-on-year to $3.6 billion or 11.3% of revenue. Second quarter non-GAAP net income improved year-over-year to $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.24.
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on our cloud vision, including all aspects of the Converged Infrastructure from storage, servers and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew revenue 15% to $5.6 billion. Operating profit grew 1.5x revenue growth or 23% to $756 million for the quarter.
Operating margin of 13.8% was up 90 basis points from the prior year, driven by a favorable product mix and supply-chain savings. Our industry-standard Service business remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 11%. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was up 1.5% year-over-year with strength in nonstop enterprise servers. In addition, customers are responding to the low total cost of ownership and the reliability in our Superdome 2 systems.
In storage, there is tremendous interest in the 3PAR utility storage solutions as customers move to the highly virtualized and dynamically tiered storage arrays, built for public and private cloud computing. 3PAR had another quarter of high double-digit operational revenue growth year-over-year, and we are now selling 3PAR solutions in 23 new countries.
Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 3% from the prior year, with strong growth in our Scalar products and data de-duplication technology, partially offset by lower EVA revenue as some customers wait for the new product refresh this summer.
HP remains #1 in the blade server market and grew ESS blade revenue 20% year-over-year. HP Networking grew 118%, including the acquisition of 3Com, and 14% year-over-year on an operational basis. While our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses, we delivered double-digit growth in our switching and routing business. We saw continued expansion of our proof-of-concept program and our recently launched flex network architecture, significantly outperformed the incumbent equivalent product. 
LÃ©o talked you through some changes we are making to our Services business. But let me provide a bit more color, including the impact to our outlook. HP Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. We delivered operating profit of $1.4 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 60 basis points from the prior year. IT Outsourcing revenue was up 2% year-over-year. The business had good long-term contract signings, driven by renewals and continues to drive healthy double-digit product pull-through.
Application Services made progress in the second quarter, with revenue up 2% year-over-year and some improvement in its short-term project work. Technology Services revenue also grew 2%, and Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 6% or up 1%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.
In Q3 of fiscal '11, we expect Services margins to be 13.5% to 14% as a result of lower revenue growth in local currency, unfavorable mix and investments we are making to further enable higher-margin business. For Q4, we expect Services margins to be a bit higher than in Q3. To better position ourselves for the future opportunities, we will need to invest in building value-added services, increasing our bench and building new delivery capabilities for these services.
We expect Services revenues to grow in the low-single digits on a reported basis in fiscal 2011. We are pleased to report the strong performance in HP Software with revenue of $764 million, up 17% compared with the prior year, led by 29% license growth, 22% service revenue growth and 8% support revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity in our security portfolio. And in our recent acquisitions, ArcSight, Fortify and Stratavia. In fact, we gained almost a point of market share in the security and vulnerability market. Second quarter operating profit was $154 million or 20.2% of revenue.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG delivered revenue of $9.4 billion, down 5% from the prior year. We have firm traction on the recovery in China, and PSG revenue in China was up double digits sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We also gained nearly 2 points a share sequentially in China and have a good mix of new products in the channel.
Across all geographies, however, we continue to see softness in the consumer PC market that offset the strength in commercial clients. By form factor, desktop revenue was down 4% and notebook revenue was down 9% year-over-year, both impacted by the consumer. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 23% versus the year-ago quarter.
In commercial, the refresh continues. Commercial Client revenue grew 13%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 28% growth. Segment operating profit totaled $533 million or 5.7% of revenue, up 100 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and product mix.
Moving on to Palm, which is included in Corporate Investments. There is a lot of anticipation about the upcoming launch of the TouchPad and the build-out of the webOS ecosystems. We remained in the investment phase in terms of completing the software build, working with the developer community on the application ecosystem and making sure that we get the product right. We are on track to ship the TouchPad this summer as previously announced. webOS is a differentiated platform that will redefine the user experience across HP's device solutions from consumers to enterprise and from smartphones to tablets and other devices.
The Imaging and Printing business delivered solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 5% to $6.7 billion, led by commercial revenue growth of 7% and supplies revenue growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue, while we continue to invest in innovation and growth.
Total printer unit shipments increased 12% with commercial and consumer printer units up 41% and 4%, respectively, as we gained market share in laser printer hardware. We are seeing solid momentum in our growth initiatives as we continue to lead the market with innovative new products.
Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22% year-over-year. Our color laser and multifunction printer units grew 26% and 60% respectively, while business ink unit shipments increased double digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled.
In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing.
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 17% to $885 million. Financing volume increased 14% and net portfolio assets increased 18%. Operating profit of $83 million is up 20% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total growth cash of $12.8 billion. Our second quarter cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 8 days from the year ago period due to a higher proportion of sales occurring late in the quarter. In Q2, days sales outstanding increased 10 days from the prior year. Inventories were up one day and days payable increased 3 days year-over-year.
Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges. We continue to generate strong cash flow with operating cash flow of $4 billion and free cash flow of $3 billion, each up over 28% from the prior year. During the second quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $5.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
And now a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. We are mindful of our colleagues and business partners that have been affected by the tragedies in Japan. And we respect the courage and resiliency of those who are working to address the situation. Our teams have been working around the clock to implement contingency plans. Together with our partners, we are working as quickly as we can to minimize the impact to our channel partners and customers, but the situation remains fluid.
We are expecting a temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit due to the events in Japan. We expect revenue to decline due to reduced demand in Japan and certain supply chain constraints in printing hardware and supplies. The total impact will be roughly $700 million of company revenue or about 1% of company revenue in the second half, with about 2/3 of the impact in the third quarter.
In addition to the margin loss on the revenue, there will be incremental costs due to the higher supply chain cost across the company related to securing parts and increased use of air freight and other costs relating to logistics.
We expect the business to recover back to a normal run rate by the end of the calendar year, and we have incorporated these expectations into our revised guidance. Due in part to the expected supply chain impact from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as continued softness in consumer PCs, we now expect Q3 revenue of $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion. For the full year, we expect the revenue to be $129 billion to $130 billion.
With respect to earnings, keep in mind the following: First, we have revised expectations for the operating profit in the Services business of 13.5% to 14% of revenue in Q3; second, aligning expense of approximately $150 million per quarter; third, a tax rate of approximately 22%; and finally, weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2011 of 2.175 billion.
Thus, we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.08. For the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $5 per share. 
With that, we will now open the call to your questions."

So we continue to be prudent in our Q3 and our FY '11 revenue outlook. And there's a couple main reasons for that prudence. The first one is that we are expecting this temporary near-term impact to revenue and operating profit as a result of the events in Japan. We do expect revenue to decline as a result of reduced demand in Japan, as well as certain supply chain constraints that's in our printing, hardware and supplies business. The total impact for the half is roughly $700 million of revenue -- company revenue, or about 1% for the half of revenue, and 2/3 of that impact is going to hit in Q3. Then the past quarter, we also saw consumer PC growth or decline more exaggerated than what we had expected when we gave our guidance at the end of Q1, and this continued softness in consumer PCs is now reflected in our revenue guidance. From an EPS standpoint, we factored in both the impact from the revenue guidance and the associated profits as you would expect that relate to Japan and the PC consumer weakness. And then in addition, we've got incremental supply chain costs across the company that are related to securing parts, and also the fact that we will increasingly use air freight as opposed to sea shipments in order to meet customer demands. And then we've also revised our expectation around the profitability for our Services business. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you should look at an operating margin in Services in Q3 of roughly 13.5% to 14% of revenue and then going into Q4, it should get a bit better."

Really, as we talked about last quarter, revenue in the Enterprise Services business has really not grown as fast as it can or should. And as we start up new ITO deals, we do defer some of the revenue and costs associated with the data center transformation. But ultimately, there's a mismatch between the revenue and the cost in the early stages of the project, and so the margins are significantly depressed in these early phases. And then we've got much of the strong ITO signings have been in the renewals -- had been renewals, which obviously come with additional price concessions, and in some cases, additional runoff. The second factor is unfavorable mix, and we talked a little bit about this last quarter as well. The revenue in signings have been heavily weighted to the lower margin ITO business, and we have not been ramping up the value-added Application Services business basically fast enough. And that's why we're making some of these decisions this quarter to reset the margins and make investments. So finally, included in our plan is the continued investment in building our delivery and sales capability and also enhancing our portfolio in these higher value-added solutions. And as an example, in our Application Services business, we will be increasing our bench of the number of people who are available in account to basically sell add-ons, Application Services business and then it will allow us obviously to respond better to customer demand. And this has left us with -- the sum total of these has really left us with a higher fixed cost structure than what was expected originally in Services, and frankly not a very rich margin until some of these ITO deals get through the transformation and transition phase."

As you can see, we are about to engage in a significant transformation of the Services business, and to be talking candid with you, in fact, we are now going to execute the strategy that were outlined on the Services business years ago. It should have had -- it should have been happening quite some time ago that we would have been -- we should have been moving into this higher value-added businesses than  did occur in the past. It will happen now. There's no doubt about that. So we will execute starting as of today. There's a number of things that we have already planned and that we can talk about in our organizational setup. For example, we have started a search for a new EVP for OEM Services organization. That person will report to me. Ann Livermore is here today as well, will be the interim Head of Services. Our Technology Services will move together with our ESSN business under the leadership of Dave Donatelli. We formed the Business Solution and Industry Services Group led by 2 very senior executives. The Business Solution Group will be developing industry-specific IP. It will be taken to the market and sold as IP or delivered as a service by the Industry Services Group. So all of these steps are being taken. It has a bit of an impact on the margins as Cathie has just outlined in the second half of this year. And going forward, it is going to be a solid business that will perform, and by the way just to make sure that you all have a good benchmark, even after the reset of the margins, we compare favorably with our main competitors in this business from a margin perspective. And going forward, our Services business in particular as of FY '12, will be a solid strong additive business to our mix and we look forward to see the value that is going is going to be generated there."

So one, can you confirm that TS is unaffected and that my interpretation of the reset is indeed the case? And then, perhaps you can -- I'm still not sure whether this is because of deals that you've signed recently that need time to ramp, which doesn't feel like a change or it's because you're going to make substantial investments to the tune of 400 or 500 basis points on a go-forward basis, perhaps you can clarify that."

Our current Enterprise Services mix is weighted to slow growing and just on that slow growing and relatively lower margin areas of the services markets.

We had customer demand, but we couldn't sell into it because it couldn't immediately address that demand. And what we figured out was we actually need to run with a little heavier bench, and we know that this is the practice that many of our competitors do that allow us to do more of the short-term signings. So all of those are actions we're taking that I would consider investments in addition to just where we are in the ITO deal."

When we look at these supplies revenue, it sort of seemed stuck in the mid-single-digit area year-over-year, despite the fact that you're seeing really solid hardware growth especially in commercial.

All of the actions that we're taking are within the guidance that Cathie's provided for you in terms of expected revenue and EPS, and not just EPS, but operating profit for Services. So we've taken into account the amount of time some of these investments and actions take to ramp in the guidance that you've got. And some of them, of course, provide shorter return than others. In some cases where we're adding resources in the security space, there's immediate demand for those resources, so it's a lot shorter return for us in areas like that. So we feel very good about that. We've hired a number of people inside our services organization from across the industry over the last year. And when they come into HP they're almost in awe of the portfolio and capabilities we have. And in fact, are surprised by in our Services business, how much capability we have. What we are talking about now is being able to invest in a lot of the new areas that our competitors don't have a better or stronger position than we have today. Now if you look at the areas like the services we can do around security and the software assets we have, it's a huge differentiation. So one of our services areas of differentiation is very closely tied to the technology and applications and IP that HP has inside our Software business, inside our Products business. So I think that's a very differentiated position that I would stand up against anybody. And it's the combination of the software assets, those products and the services we can build around them that gives us a very differentiated capability. The other thing we've got is we've got an installed base of customers who want to buy more from HP and are very interested and eager for us to provide these additional services and many of our competitors don't have that. Now we've got an installed base who want us to provide more of these services. So I think those are quite differentiated opportunities for HP and particularly the IP that we're developing around the industries and that we have based on our software portfolio is quite differentiated."

The good news is that if I look across the HP business, other businesses where we are doing really well and where we had made some of the good decisions and we are actually now getting some of the benefits of that. Let me just gave you 2 good examples for that. One is Networking where we see great performance happening and where we outgrew our competition to produce much better product that is significantly better price performance ratio than anyone else, and that's why we're winning so much. We're adding a lot of innovation there as well with new products, including our flex network software. And as we're adding IP to our various businesses, we are creating the differentiation. Let me point out another business where we're doing extremely well that hasn't been talked about too much today, our Software business. And while we talk about the overall growth of the Software business, as you know very well, you should measure Software businesses by the growth in licenses, and there we grew by 29%, which shows that once you start going into differentiated aspects of the business, you start to invest in IP, you reap the benefits of it. So overall, I think we were aligned."

First of all, we reconfirm the target we set out for ourselves during the summit of $7 EPS for FY '14. We maintain that target. And the reason why we believe we will achieve this is, among others, the investments we're making today in the Services business. The Services business can be leveraged in particular as I mentioned before through our IP. And we will need to add IP to our Services business, on the one hand as IP, and on the other hand as intellectual capital that differentiates ourselves from others. I believe that we can achieve this over the next coming quarters, and we have the delivery capability and the sales capability to bring this successfully to the customers. There is demand out there. It dovetails really well  with our cloud strategy and the huge demand that we see in the market for cloud migrations, cloud adoptions and cloud transformations. So we are dovetailing into this. We are also generating new revenue streams. I mentioned software earlier on, there are others that are coming, so I believe we are well-positioned.

It is indeed a lot of news. Let me put all in some perspective for you. Today is all about rising shareholder values and addressing the challenges we face in our business. But most of all, today is about transforming HP for the future. I've now been here as CEO for 9 months. I've looked at all of the businesses. I examined each in depth and carefully considered a path forward. These are tough decisions. There are 4 elements to that path. Let me summarize them and then I'll talk about each in turn. First, secular trends impacting our PSG business as consumers are changing the use of the PC. The fact is real and sales of the Touchpad are not meeting our expectations. We see opportunity for PSG to compete and win in the PC marketplace and our board has authorized us to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP to a spinoff of other transaction. The contemplated direction is an important component of our strategy to soften HP's focus on cloud, solutions and software, accessible to any type of device, while we continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including printing hardware, software and services. 
Second, our enterprise service business needs to be reshaped as we have discussed in the last few quarters. The effort is well underway and today, we will announce a new dealer for that unit. 
Third, there are technical issues that we are facing. The challenge for our business-critical systems business due to the Oracle issue is real and we are addressing that. And we are confronting the challenge of the Japanese earthquake in our printing business and still facing headwinds. And fourth, we must create more strategic relationships with our customers, that will come from delivering value-added IP. Our focus on building a successful software business momentum and we are going to accelerate that today with the acquisition of Autonomy. 
Now let me address each of these topics in turn. First, the velocity of change in the personal device marketplace continues to increase and the competitive landscape is growing increasingly more complex, especially around the personal computing arena. There's a clear secular movement in the consumer PC space. The impact of the economy has impacted consumer sales and the tablet effect is real. And our touchpads have not been gaining enough traction in the marketplace. For our PC business to remain the world's largest personal computing business, it needs the flexibility and agility to make decisions best direction. That is why the Board of Directors has authorized our management team to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP for a spinoff of other transaction. We anticipate that we will take 12 to 18 months to complete this process. Meanwhile, we will be very focused on continuing to drive profitable growth and execution in PSG for HP's customers, trading partners and employees who have continued to demonstrate PSG's market leadership, ingenuity and innovation. Additionally, we have been tracking closely the progress of webOS and analyzing its operational performance and market opportunities. We were successful at launching software that was poised with differentiated user experience. We know that many developments feel the operating system is elegantly designed and respected platform. Therefore, we are exploring options for how best to optimize the value of webOS software going forward. However, our webOS devices have not gained enough traction in the marketplace with consumers and we see ramp up in the market share. Due to market dynamics, significant competitions and a rapidly changing environment and this week's news only reiterates the speed and nature of this change, continuing to execute our current device approach in this market space is no longer in the best interest of HP and HP's shareholders. Therefore, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to shut down the webOS hardware provisions within Q4 2011. Transformation can involve difficult decisions but we take these steps to better position for the future. 
Second, let's take a look at services. As we have discussed the past 2 quarters, we'll focus on transforming our services business. While i feel good about the progress and increased level of rigor we're building, I reiterate that this will be a multiquarter journey. There are also areas requiring increased discipline and improved processes. On the investment side, we continue to invest in emerging services to accelerate growth, including cloud, industry solutions and analytics. We're also focused on addressing sales delivery and business development challenges. We are working to better manage our skills in order to more effectively meet customer demand. We are rigorously conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we are optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. I'm very pleased to announce that effective immediately, will become the new EVP of Enterprise Services and he will report directly to me. John has a solid track record of success in this arena. Previously, he served as general manager of IBM's integrated technology services unit for North America. John has brought his extensive experience to HP where he has been fully invested in our business for the past several months in the Americas region and is already demonstrating his leadership. I welcome him to our Executive Council. Following her recent appointment to the HP Board of Directors, Anne Livermore will fully transition out of the day-to-day operations. I look forward to her continued contributions to HP as a member of our board and I thank her for her interim leadership of our services business and for her support. 
Third, we must address some of the technical challenges facing our business. In Business Critical Systems, we firmly believe that HP server-based platform, is by far, the best in the industry and we are fully committed to its future. In fact, it is the strength of this platform that is likely behind all approach to drive customers away from HP technology. We are doing everything we can, including pursuing legal actions, to protect our customers and our business against all customer behavior. In IPG, we have seen revenue and margin challenges from Japan due to laser shortages caused by the earthquake in Japan and the margin impact from the rising yen. Cathie will detail more of this in a moment but I think HP has done a good job in managing the crisis. The speed and the size of the yen movement created the margin headwind for us in Q3, and at this yen levels, we expect there will be a continued headwind going forward. 
Fourth, I'd like to discuss our move to drive value added IT into our portfolio. We laid out a strategic vision in March and I'm ever more convinced it's the right way. We will continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including hardware, printing, software and services. We will invest in our HP strategy focused on Cloud and solutions and the software underpinning it all, including data analytics and securities. And we will move more firmly to higher margin growth opportunities that position HP for more strategic customer relationships. When we acquired vertical earlier this year, we talked about how it enhances our capabilities for information optimization by adding a sophisticated realtime predictive analytical capability for large and complex sets of data. The emerging trends we saw at that time has now accelerated and reached the point where there is an opportunity for us to shape the industry's information in data market. We believe we can build the next generation information platform to reinvent our information as processed, analyzed, optimized, automated and protected, both for unstructured and structured data and just to be clear, structured data is about data transactional data. Unstructured data is all about how all of us interact naturally through e-mails, video, text, voice and social media. That is why I'm excited today to announce our plans to acquire Autonomy, the leading enterprise information management software company specialized in unstructured data. Before I outline the strategic rationale behind this deal, let me give you some financial highlights. Today, we announced the terms of a recommended transaction under which HP will acquire all of the outstanding shares of autonomy for $25.50 per share in cash. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for HP shareholders in the first full year following completion. It is not a profit forecast of the city code of United Kingdom. And we expect to complete the acquisition of Autonomy by the end of calendar 2011. This is a milestone moment because there is a very real and concrete need for our customers to address the explosion of unstructured and structured information. Autonomy's intelligent data operating layer is an effective standard in our more than 400 OEMs and is supported by substantial IT. Additionally, the Autonomy platform, both structured and unstructured data, from a broad range of sources, and they offer their product both traditional software license and cloud mode. Autonomy today is one of the largest cloud players with over 30 betabytes of customer information under management via the cloud-based archiving and backup solution. They have over 25,000 customers globally. Autonomy sees the information transformation and subsequent market opportunity exactly as we do. Moreover, Autonomy business is well aligned to HP's effort to change in focus our business mix. In 2010, autonomy had gross margins in the high 80 and operating margins above 40%. They have demonstrated a strong, consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth. Mike Lynch, Autonomy's cofounder and CEO, heads a team of brilliant scientists and employees. Additionally, operationally, the 2 companies and cultures will blend together well. Reporting directly to me, Mike will continue to lead autonomy which will continue to operate separately so we can keep them focused on their own market momentum while at the same time they can play a key role in enabling the opportunities we see and the strategy we've outlined for HP. As an Executive who has spent most of my career primarily in software, it is a world I know well. From acquisitions acquire heavy lifting but bringing Autonomy into the HP world will be seamless and highly complementary We believe this transaction will unlock synergies within autonomy and the HP enterprise offerings, including ESSN, software services and IPG's and across multiple industry verticals. We are building a strong HP software business. We have done so through successful acquisitions like ArcSight and fortified. We have had excellent growth and performance this year from our software units, so the acquisition of Autonomy will build on that momentum and accelerate our HP software strategy. We all have witnessed an increased level of market volatility and especially today. You might ask, is a move like Autonomy is right in this market? But the market fluctuations does not change, the underlying opportunity, the value proposition of HP and Autonomy and the need to transform HP's business to create a stronger company. And most importantly, we very strongly believe the transaction will create significant value for our shareholders. All of the decisive moves as made provide HP with the most shareholder returns, markets where we can demonstrate a sustainable competitive advantage, maximize customer value, deliver on our solution visions, differentiate with IP wins. We are focusing on what needs to be fixed, what needs to be shut down and what needs to be considered for separation. And equally, if not more importantly, we are focused on what the value added needs to be added to HP in order to stay a leader in the IT world and represent the true value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Lastly, I'd like to make a comment on guidance. I'm lowering the Q4 guidance and the think about where we are and the challenges we are facing. These challenges and the transformation we are undertaking will take several quarters to fully resolve. I don't take this action lightly. I know our investors don't like being in this position and neither do I.. I feel their pain. But as CEO, I believe in transparency about what we are facing and be clear on the decisive things we are doing now about it. To conclude, I'm taking ownership for these decisions and investments with a focus on driving actions that deliver value for shareholders as we shape the new HP. Now, let's take a look at the numbers with Cathie."
108856,117489370,160627,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, LÃ©o .

Today, we're delivering a tough outlook, definitely the most difficult one for me as CFO. LÃ©o  has walked you through the details of the steps we are taking and how they will lay the foundation for transforming and rebuilding Hewlett-Packard. Let me review our Q3 results to set some context for our outlook. Revenue of $31.2 billion was up 1.5% year-over-year but down 2 points in constant currency. By geography, revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 9% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas was flat year-on-year but down 2% in constant currency, and revenue in EMEA was also flat year-over-year but down 5% in constant currency. Company level gross margin of 23.3% was down 70 basis points year-over-year and down 130 basis points sequentially. Our printing, services and webOS businesses posted lower gross margin rates, which were partially offset by a favorable commodity pricing environment in PSG and ESSN. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.8% was down 140 basis points, with operating profit down 11% year-over-year. And we generated $3 billion in earnings from operations compared to $3.4 billion a year ago and down 14% sequentially. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $121 million and our tax rate remains at 22%. Third quarter non-GAAP net income of $2.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.10. Share count declined 12% year-over-year to $2.08 billion as we repurchased 128 million shares in the quarter for a total of $4.6 billion. HP generated $3.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $10.2 billion year-to-date. 
Now, turning to the business unit performance. The Personal Systems Group, which remains the number one PC business across notebooks and desktops with 18.1% share, delivered revenue of $9.6 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Operating profit for this segment was up 21% year-over-year to $567 million or 5.9% of revenue. This is up 120 basis points year-over-year, largely due to lower component costs and favorable customer mix. Commercial Client revenue grew 9%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 19% revenue growth. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 17% versus the year-ago quarter. Both desktop and notebooks were down 4% year-over-year as both segments continue to be equally affected by the weakness in the consumer demand. Corporate Investments, which includes webOS, recorded revenue of $266 million and an operating loss of $332 million in the quarter. About a year ago, we made a bet on webOS and the opportunity to launch our own ecosystem around devices, applications and new markets. At that time, we set clear metrics and milestones to monitor the success of webOS. We launched the flagship product, the Touchpad on July 1 and frankly, the software was met by strong reviews but the sell-through of the product was not what we expected. Our intention was to solidify webOS as a clear number 2 platform for tablet. But with such a young ecosystem and poorly received hardware, we were unable to achieve our target. Additionally, it quickly became clear that pricing parity would not generate demand and we subsequently lowered Touchpad pricing by $100, which has added incremental near-term cost to our model. Even with the price reduction in Q3, we needed to better align our unit forecast with the sell-through reality in the quarter and we took a $0.05 charge to EPS in addition to the loss we were already expecting in the business. We would expect an even larger loss for webOS in Q4 if we continue to operate the business in its current form. Essentially, the Touchpad and our webOS phones have not met our financial targets and other milestones that were set. To make this investment a financial success would require significant investments over the next one to 2 years, creating risk without clear returns. Therefore, we have decided to shut down operations around webOS devices and we'll be exploring strategic alternatives to optimize the value of the software platforms and development capabilities. 
Turning to imaging and printing, we delivered net revenue of $6.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. The Q3 Japan impact, resulting primarily from the LaserJet hardware and toner constraints, was about what we expected in terms of revenue and operating profit on our commercial business. Commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year, with commercial hardware units up 1%. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year on 7% unit growth. In total, printer in units were up 6% year-over-year. IPG continues to lead the market in innovation. Indigo digital press page volume was up 23% year-over-year and we shipped more than 3 million Web-connected printers again this quarter. Supplies revenue was flat year-over-year at $4.1 billion. We ended the quarter with higher-than-normal channel inventory in supplies, especially ink, as sell-through slowed at the end of the quarter. Our supplies business tends to follow the economy, and given the current market uncertainty, we're remaining cautious. We'll need to begin working through this inventory and the resulting mix shift towards hardware is expected to have a revenue and margin impact over the next few quarters. In Q3, operating profit for IPG totaled $892 million or 14.7% of revenue, down 220 basis points year-over-year. Roughly 1/2 of the operating profit decline year-over-year was due to laser toner supply shortages caused by the tsunami in Japan and 1/2 was due to the rising yen. The speed and the size of the yen movement created a margin headwind for us in Q3 and at these yen levels, we expect there'll be a continued headwind going forward. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter but was down 2% in constant currency. We delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue, down 220 basis points from the prior year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we are focused on driving a greater mix of higher value-added services. This means investing in delivery and business development resources, as well as developing industry-specific services practices in IP. We're also improving our tools and processes while adding more management rigor at the account level. We've been conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we are optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. These investments and incremental process improvements are expected to generate mid- to long-term growth but they continue to put pressure on HP Services margins. Our services transformation is a 4 to 6 quarter journey and we expect our services margin to be roughly 12.5% during this time. IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Signings were largely driven by renewals in an environment of contractual price reductions and competition. While these renewals helped to protect revenue backlog, we need to work on new logos and add on deals to generate sustainable revenue growth. ITO is focused on improving its revenue growth and margins from new service offerings, including Enterprise Cloud services. We are also methodically working to improve profitability at some legacy accounts that have lower gross margines. Application Services revenue was up 2% year-over-year and we continue to invest in the business and pursue application modernization services, security, hybrid cloud services and analytics. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 9% year-over-year, including a 4-point headwind from the divestiture of Accelerate HRO and revenue runoff that was partially offset by the volume increase in healthcare. Technology services revenue grew 5%, with strong order growth in TS Consulting Services. We continue to gain strong traction with our cloud workshop. 
Enterprise server, storage and networking grew revenue 7% to $5.4 billion. Operating profit of $699 million was down 1% and operating margin of 13% was down 110 basis points from the prior year. Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue and incremental investments in sales and R&D. Across ESSN, we are seeing a slower economic environment and expect below normal sequential growth going forward. Our industry standard servers remain number one in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 9% and we expect to show share gains for calendar Q2. While we remain well positioned in the fastest-growing areas of the market, we expect ISS year-over-year growth to slow in the fourth quarter, driven by very difficult prior year comparison and the slowing demand environment I mentioned earlier. HP remains number one in the blade server market, with roughly 1/2 the market and grew ESS blade revenues 15% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 9% year-over-year. This decline is sharper than expected as our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's decisions and orders are being delayed or canceled. We are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. Our HP storage portfolio is in transition. Overall, HP storage revenue increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 17% growth in external disk products. Our products based on StoreOnce data deduplication technology had another strong quarter and 3Par sales continue to accelerate, achieving triple-digit revenue growth year-over-year on a normalized basis. Partially offsetting growth in these key areas were year-over-year declines in our tapes and EVA product lines. HP Networking grew 15% year-over-year, the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit growth. Switching and routing, including Virtual Connect, grew 18% while our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses. We are expanding our presence in core data center enterprises, with more than 30 new logos in Q3. We feel good about our business model, customer value proposition and ability to continue gaining share. 
Turning to HP software, we delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $780 million, up 20% compared with the prior year, including 29% license growth, 30% services revenue growth and 12% support revenue growth. Our newest security solutions Fortify continue to generate double-digit growth on an operational basis as did the BTO business. Third quarter operating profit was $151 million or 19.4% of revenue. HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 22% to $932 million. Financing volume increased 16% and net portfolio of assets increased 17%. Operating profit of $88 million is up 22% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We closed the quarter with total growth cash of $13 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 9 days from the prior year, due primarily to a back end loaded quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 6 days from the prior year. Inventory days were flat and days payable decreased 3 days. Channel inventories are within acceptable ranges for PSG and ESSN but higher than we would like for IPG as I described earlier. HP generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $11.3 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking forward, HP continues to be challenged by macro uncertainties that may impact each of our businesses, both consumer and commercial. We are also working to transform our services business, which will take time. Given the variability and changes in our operating model as we execute this significant transformation, we are removing our long-term financial target of a $7 EPS in 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP expectations are: first, we expect revenue to be in the range of $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion, which is below our normal seasonality, given the macro environment, higher channel inventory and printing supplies and our ongoing services transformation. Second, we expect the operating margins on the services business to be roughly 12.5%. Third, we expect OI&E expense of approximately $150 million and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. We expect only moderate reduction in weighted average shares outstanding in Q4 as a result of Q3 repurchases that occurred late in the quarter. Thus, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 and $1.16. For GAAP guidance, we expect to take a GAAP-only cash charge of approximately $1 billion for restructuring and shutdown costs related to webOS devices. In addition, as of July 31, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately $1.2 billion per more. As we work through strategic alternatives for webOS software, we will evaluate these assets for any potential impairments, and if appropriate, recognize a related noncash charge. We expect to have a $300 million to $400 million GAAP-only expense due to the cost of the British pound options we're buying to hedge the purchase price of the Autonomy transaction. Thus, we expect fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.44 and $0.55. For the full year FY '11, we expect revenue to be $127.2 billion to $127.6 billion. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.82 and $4.86 per share. We expect full year GAAP EPS to be between $3.59 and $3.70 and cash flow from operations to be roughly $12 billion and free cash flow of $8 billion, including the cash charge associated with the shutdown of webOS devices. We are repositioning our portfolio, discontinuing or exploring options for lower margin businesses and investing in higher margin areas, including services and software. This effort will require patience but the clear objective is to drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over Leo."

Let me start by actually making sure that everybody on the call understands what Autonomy represents for us. Autonomy represents an opportunity for HP for us to accelerate our vision to decisively and profitably lead a large and growing space, which is the enterprise information management space. It also brings HP higher value business solutions that will help customers manage the explosion of information. When we execute this deal, this will position HP as a leader in the margin growing space. This will complement our existing technology portfolio and enterprise strategy, it will provide differentiated IP for services and extensive vertical capability in key industries. We will provide IPG a base for content management platform. It will, overtime, significantly enhance HP's financial profile. And the board believes that the transaction is accretive to HP's non-GAAP earnings in its first full year after completion. Autonomy as a business has a very profitable financial model with a very compelling value proposition and they have been able to link solutions into 400 OEMs, which shows that they are basically industry standards. Autonomy has grown its revenues at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 55% and adjusted operating profit at a rate of approximately 83% over the last 5 years. We were buying a very strong business and we believe we can extract a lot more out of this business by combining it with HP, and that was the justification for the price."

It is indeed a lot of news. Let me put it all in some perspective for you. Today is all about rising shareholder values and addressing the challenges we face in our business. But most of all, today is about transforming HP for the future. I've now been here as CEO for 9 months. I've looked at all of the businesses. I examined each in depth and carefully considered a path forward. These are tough decisions. There are 4 elements to that path. Let me summarize them, and then I'll talk about each in turn. First, secular trends impacting our PSG business as consumers are changing the use of the PC. The tablet effect is real and sales of the TouchPad are not meeting our expectations. We see the opportunity for PSG to compete and win in the PC marketplace and our board has authorized us to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP through a spinoff or other transaction. The contemplated direction is an important component of our strategy to sharpen HP's focus on cloud, solutions and software, accessible to any type of device, while we continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including printing hardware, software and services. 
Second, our Enterprise Service business needs to be reshaped as we have discussed in the last 2 quarters. The effort is well underway, and today we will announce a new dealer for that unit. 
Third, there are technical issues that we are facing. The challenge to our Business Critical Systems business due to the Oracle Itanium issue is real, and we are addressing that. And we are confronting the challenge of the Japanese earthquake in our Printing business and still face, again, headwinds. 
And fourth, we must create more strategic relationships with our customers that will come from delivering value-added IP. Our focus on building a successful software business has momentum, and we are going to accelerate that today with the acquisition of Autonomy. 
Now let me address each of these topics in turn. First, the velocity of change in the personal device marketplace continues to increase and the competitive landscape is growing increasingly more complex, especially around the personal computing arena. There's a clear secular movement in the consumer PC space. The impact of the economy has impacted consumer sales and the tablet effect is real. And our TouchPad has not been gaining enough traction in the marketplace. For our PC business to remain the world's largest personal computing business, it needs the flexibility and agility to make decisions best for its future direction. That is why the Board of Directors has authorized our management team to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP through a spinoff or other transaction. We anticipate that we will take 12 to 18 months to complete this process. Meanwhile, we will be very focused on continuing to drive profitable growth and execution in PSG for HP's customers, trading partners and employees who have continued to demonstrate PSG's market leadership, ingenuity and innovation. Additionally, we have been tracking closely the progress of webOS and analyzing its operational performance and market opportunities. We were successful at launching software that was poised with differentiated user experience. We know that many developers feel the operating system is elegantly designed and is a respected platform. Therefore, we are exploring options for how best to optimize the value of webOS software going forward. However, our webOS devices have not gained enough traction in the marketplace with consumers and we see too long a ramp up in the market share. Due to market dynamics, significant competition and a rapidly changing environment and this week's news only reiterates the speed and nature of this change, continuing to execute our current device approach in this market space is no longer in the best interest of HP and HP's shareholders. Therefore, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to shut down the webOS hardware provisions within Q4 2011. Transformation can involve difficult decisions, but we take these steps to better position for the future. 
Second, let's take a look at services. As we have discussed the past 2 quarters, we'll focus on transforming our Services business. While I feel good about the progress and increased level of rigor we're building, I reiterate that this will be a multi-quarter journey. There are also areas requiring increased discipline and improved processes. On the investment side, we continue to invest in emerging services to accelerate growth, including cloud, industry solutions and analytics. We're also focused on addressing sales, delivery and business development challenges. We are working to better manage our skills supply in order to more effectively meet customer demand. We are rigorously conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we're optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. 
I'm very pleased to announce that effective immediately that John Visentin will become the new EVP of Enterprise Services and he will report directly to me. John has a solid track record of success in this arena. Previously, he served as general manager of IBM's Integrated Technology Services unit for North America. John has brought his extensive experience to HP where he has been fully invested in our business for the past several months in the Americas region and is already demonstrating his leadership. I welcome him to our Executive Council. Following her recent appointment to the HP Board of Directors, Anne Livermore will fully transition out of the day-to-day operations. I look forward to her continued contributions to HP as a member of our board, and I thank her for her interim leadership of our Services business and for her support. 
Third, we must address some of the technical challenges facing our business. In Business Critical Systems, we firmly believe that HP Itanium-based server platform is by far the best in the industry and we are fully committed to its future. In fact, it is the strength of this platform that is likely behind all those approach to drive customers away from HP technology. We are doing everything we can, including pursuing legal actions, to protect our customers and our business against all anti-customer behavior. 
In IPG, we have seen revenue and margin challenges from Japan due to laser shortages caused by the earthquake in Japan and the margin impact from the rising yen. Cathie will detail more of this in a moment, but I think HP has done a good job in managing the crisis. The speed and the size of the yen movement created a margin headwind for us in Q3, and at this yen levels, we expect there will be a continued headwind going forward. 
Fourth, I'd like to discuss our move to drive more value-added IP into our portfolio. We laid out a strategic vision in March, and I'm ever more convinced it's the right way. We will continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including hardware, printing, software and services. We will invest in our HP strategy focused on cloud and solutions and the software underpinning it all, including pick data analytics and securities. And we will move more firmly to higher margin growth opportunities that position HP for more strategic customer relationships. 
When we acquired Vertica earlier this year, we talked about how it's enhanced our capabilities for information optimization by adding a sophisticated realtime predictive analytical capability for large and complex sets of data. The emerging trends we saw at that time has now accelerated and reached the point where there is an opportunity for us to shape the industry's information in data market. We believe we can build the next generation information platform to reinvent how information as processed, analyzed, optimized, automated and protected, both for unstructured and structured data. And just to be clear, structured data is about database transactional data. Unstructured data is all about how all of us interact naturally through e-mails, video, text, voice and social media. That is why I'm excited today to announce our plans to acquire Autonomy, the leading enterprise information management software company specialized in unstructured data. 
Before I outline the strategic rationale behind this deal, let me give you some financial highlights. Today, we announced the terms of a recommended transaction under which HP will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Autonomy for GBP 25.50 per share in cash. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for HP shareholders in the first full year following completion. It is not a profit forecast for all 28.6 of the City Code of United Kingdom. And we expect to complete the acquisition of Autonomy by the end of calendar 2011. This is a milestone moment because there is a very real and concrete need for our customers to address the explosion of unstructured and structured information. Autonomy's intelligent data operating layer is an effective standard on our more than 400 OEMs and is supported by substantial IP. Additionally, the Autonomy platform, both structured and unstructured data, from a broad range of sources, and they offer their product via both traditional software license and cloud mode. Autonomy today is one of the largest cloud players with over 30 petabytes of customer information under management via the cloud-based archiving and backup solution. They have over 25,000 customers globally. Autonomy sees the information transformation and subsequent market opportunity exactly as we do. Moreover, Autonomy business is well aligned to HP's effort to change and focus our business mix. In 2010, autonomy had gross margins in the high 80s and operating margins above 40%. They have demonstrated a strong, consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth. Mike Lynch, Autonomy's co-founder and CEO, heads a team of brilliant scientists and employees. Additionally, operationally, the 2 companies and cultures will blend together well. Reporting directly to me, Mike will continue to lead Autonomy which will continue to operate separately so we can keep them focused on their own market momentum, while at the same time they can play a key role in enabling the opportunities we see and the strategy we've outlined for HP. 
As an executive who has spent most of my career primarily in software, it is a world I know well. Some acquisitions require heavy lifting, but bringing Autonomy into the HP world will be seamless and highly complementary. We believe this transaction will unlock synergies within Autonomy and the HP enterprise offerings, including ESSN, software, services and IPG and across multiple industry verticals. We are building a strong HP software business. We have done so through successful acquisitions like ArcSight and Fortify. We have had excellent growth and performance this year from our software units, so the acquisition of Autonomy will build on that momentum and accelerate our HP software strategy. 
We all have witnessed an increased level of market volatility and especially today. So you might ask if a move like Autonomy is right in this market; but the market fluctuations does not change. The underlying opportunity, the value proposition of HP and Autonomy and the need to transform HP's business to create a stronger company. And most importantly, we very strongly believe the transaction will create significant value for our shareholders. All of the decisive moves I've made provide HP with the most shareholder returns, markets where we can demonstrate a sustainable competitive advantage, maximize customer value, deliver on our solutions vision, differentiate with IP and win. We are focusing on what needs to be fixed, what needs to be shut down and what needs to be considered for separation. And equally, if not more importantly, we are focused on what value added IP needs to be added to HP in order to stay a leader in the IT world and represent a true value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Lastly, I'd like to make a comment on guidance. I'm lowering the Q4 guidance to be realistic about where we are and the challenges we are facing. These challenges and the transformation we are undertaking will take several quarters to fully resolve. I don't take this action lightly. I know our investors don't like being in this position and neither do I. I feel their pain. But as CEO, I believe in transparency about what we are facing and be clear on the decisive things we are doing now about it. To conclude, I'm taking ownership for these decisions and investments with a focus on driving actions that deliver value for shareholders as we shape the new HP. Now, let's take a look at the numbers with Cathie."

Today, we're delivering a tough outlook, definitely the most difficult one for me as CFO. LÃ©o has walked you through the details of the steps we are taking and how they will lay the foundation for transforming and rebuilding Hewlett-Packard. Let me review our Q3 results to set some context for our outlook. Revenue of $31.2 billion was up 1.5% year-over-year, but down 2 points in constant currency. By geography, revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 9% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas was flat year-on-year, but down 2% in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was also flat year-over-year, but down 5% in constant currency. Company level gross margin of 23.3% was down 70 basis points year-over-year and down 130 basis points sequentially. our Printing, Services and webOS businesses posted lower gross margin rates, which were partially offset by a favorable commodity pricing environment in PSG and ESSN. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.8% was down 140 basis points, with operating profit down 11% year-over-year. And we generated $3 billion in earnings from operations compared to $3.4 billion a year ago and down 14% sequentially. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $121 million and our tax rate remains at 22%. Third quarter non-GAAP net income of $2.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.10. Share count declined 12% year-over-year to $2.08 billion as we repurchased 128 million shares in the quarter for a total of $4.6 billion. HP generated $3.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $10.2 billion year-to-date. 
Now, turning to the business unit performance. The Personal Systems Group, which remains the number one PC business across notebooks and desktops with 18.1% share, delivered revenue of $9.6 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Operating profit for this segment was up 21% year-over-year to $567 million or 5.9% of revenue. This is up 120 basis points year-over-year, largely due to lower component costs and favorable customer mix. Commercial Client revenue grew 9%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 19% revenue growth. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 17% versus the year-ago quarter. Both desktop and notebook were down 4% year-over-year as both segments continue to be equally affected by the weakness in the consumer demand. 
Corporate Investments, which includes webOS, recorded revenue of $266 million and an operating loss of $332 million in the quarter. About a year ago, we made a bet on webOS and the opportunity to launch our own ecosystem around devices, applications and new markets. At that time, we set clear metrics and milestones to monitor the success of webOS. We launched the flagship product, the TouchPad, on July 1. And frankly, the software was met by strong reviews, but the sell-through of the product was not what we expected. Our intention was to solidify webOS as the clear number 2 platform for tablet. But with such a young ecosystem and poorly received hardware, we were unable to achieve our target. Additionally, it quickly became clear that pricing parity would not generate demand and we subsequently lowered TouchPad pricing by $100, which has added incremental near-term cost to our model. Even with the price reduction in Q3, we needed to better align our unit forecast with the sell-through reality in the quarter, and we took a $0.05 charge to EPS in addition to the loss we were already expecting in the business. We would expect an even larger loss for webOS in Q4 if we continue to operate the business in its current form. Essentially, the TouchPad and our webOS phone have not met our financial targets and other milestones that were set. To make this investment a financial success would require significant investments over the next 1 to 2 years, creating risk without clear returns. Therefore, we have decided to shut down operations around webOS devices and we'll be exploring strategic alternatives to optimize the value of the software platform and development capability.
Turning to Imaging and Printing, we delivered net revenue of $6.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. The Q3 Japan impact, resulting primarily from the LaserJet hardware and toner constraints, was about what we expected in terms of revenue and operating profit on our Commercial business. Commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year, with commercial hardware units up 1%. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year on 7% unit growth. In total, printer units were up 6% year-over-year. IPG continues to lead the market in innovation. Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 23% year-over-year, and we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers again this quarter. Supplies revenue was flat year-over-year at $4.1 billion. We ended the quarter with higher than normal channel inventory in supplies, especially ink, as sell-through slowed at the end of the quarter. Our Supplies business tends to follow the economy, and given the current market uncertainty, we're remaining cautious. We'll need to begin working through this inventory and the resulting mix shift toward hardware is expected to have a revenue and margin impact over the next few quarters. In Q3, operating profit for IPG totaled $892 million or 14.7% of revenue, down 220 basis points year-over-year. Roughly 1/2 of the operating profit decline year-over-year was due to laser toner supply shortages caused by the tsunami in Japan and 1/2 was due to the rising yen. The speed and the size of the yen movement created a margin headwind for us in Q3 and at these yen levels, we expect there'll be a continued headwind going forward. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but was down 2% in constant currency. We delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue, down 220 basis points from the prior year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we're focused on driving a greater mix of higher value-added services. This means investing in delivery and business development resources, as well as developing industry-specific services practices and IP. We're also improving our tools and processes while adding more management rigor at the account level. We've been conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we're optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. These investments and incremental process improvements are expected to generate mid- to long-term growth, but they continue to put pressure on HP Services margins. Our services transformation is a 4- to 6-quarter journey and we expect our services margin to be roughly 12.5% during this time. 
IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Signings were largely driven by renewals in an environment of contractual price reductions and competition. While these renewals help to protect revenue backlog, we need to work on new logos and add-on deals to generate sustainable revenue growth. ITO is focused on improving its revenue growth and margins through new service offerings, including Enterprise Cloud services. We are also methodically working to improve profitability at some legacy accounts that have lower gross margins. 
Application Services revenue was up 2% year-over-year and we continue to invest in the business and pursue application modernization services, security, private and hybrid cloud services and analytics. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 9% year-over-year, including a 4-point headwind from the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO and revenue runoff that was only partially offset by the volume increase in healthcare. Technology Services revenue grew 5%, with strong order growth in TS Consulting Services. We continue to gain strong traction with our Cloud Workshop. 
Enterprise server, storage and networking grew revenue 7% to $5.4 billion. Operating profit of $699 million was down 1% and operating margin of 13% was down 110 basis points from the prior year. Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue and incremental investments in sales and R&D. Across ESSN, we are seeing a slower economic environment and expect below normal sequential growth going forward. Our industry standard servers remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 9%, and we expect to show share gains for calendar Q2. While we remain well positioned in the fastest growing areas of the market, we expect ISS year-over-year growth to slow in the fourth quarter, driven by a very difficult prior year comparison and the slowing demand environment I mentioned earlier.  HP remains number one in the blade server market, with roughly half the market and grew ESS blade revenues 15% year-over-year. 
Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 9% year-over-year. This decline is sharper than expected as our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's Itanium decision and orders are being delayed or canceled. We are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. 
Our HP storage portfolio is in transition. Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 17% growth in external disk products. Our products, based on StoreOnce data deduplication technology, had another strong quarter and 3PAR sales continue to accelerate, achieving triple-digit revenue growth year-over-year on a normalized basis. Partially offsetting growth in these key areas were year-over-year declines in our tape and EVA product lines. 
HP Networking grew 15% year-over-year, the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit growth. Switching and routing, including Virtual Connect, grew 18% while our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses. We are expanding our presence in core data center enterprises, with more than 30 new logos in Q3. We feel good about our business model, customer value proposition and ability to continue gaining share. 
Turning to HP Software. We delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $780 million, up 20% compared with the prior year, including 29% license growth, 30% services revenue growth and 12% support revenue growth. Our newest security solutions, ArcSight and Fortify, continue to generate double-digit growth on an operational basis as did the BTO business. Third quarter operating profit was $151 million or 19.4% of revenue. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 22% to $932 million. Financing volume increased 16% and net portfolio of assets increased 17%. Operating profit of $88 million is up 22% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $13 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 9 days from the prior year, due primarily to a back end loaded quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 6 days from the prior year. Inventory days were flat and days payable decreased 3 days. Channel inventories are within acceptable ranges for PSG and ESSN, but higher than we would like for IPG as I described earlier. HP generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $11.3 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking forward, HP continues to be challenged by macro uncertainties that may impact each of our businesses, both consumer and commercial. We are also working to transform our Services business, which will take time. Given the variability and changes in our operating model as we execute this significant transformation, we are removing our long-term financial target of a $7 EPS in 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP expectations are: first, we expect revenue to be in the range of $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion, which is below our normal seasonality, given the macro environment, higher channel inventory and printing supplies and our ongoing services transformation. Second, we expect the operating margins on the Services business to be roughly 12.5%. Third, we expect OI&E expense of approximately $150 million and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. We expect only moderate reduction in weighted average shares outstanding in Q4 as a result of Q3 repurchases that occurred late in the quarter. Thus, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 and $1.16. For GAAP guidance, we expect to take a GAAP-only cash charge of approximately $1 billion for restructuring and shutdown costs related to webOS devices. In addition, as of July 31, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately $1.2 billion per Palm. 
As we work through strategic alternatives for webOS software, we will evaluate these assets for any potential impairments, and if appropriate, recognize a related noncash charge. We expect to have a $300 million to $400 million GAAP-only expense due to the cost of the British pound options we're buying to hedge the purchase price of the Autonomy transaction. Thus, we expect fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.44 and $0.55. For the full year FY '11, we expect revenue to be $127.2 billion to $127.6 billion. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.82 and $4.86 per share. We expect full year GAAP EPS to be between $3.59 and $3.70 and cash flow from operations to be roughly $12 billion and free cash flow of $8 billion, including the cash charge associated with the shutdown of webOS devices. 
We are repositioning our portfolio, discontinuing or exploring options for lower margin businesses and investing in higher margin areas, including Services and Software. This effort will require patience, but the clear objective is to drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over LÃ©o.."

And when you look at our ESSN business, you will see that we had actually good performance across the entire board of our various offerings. What is important to note is that the public sector, which counts for about 10% of our business, has been impacted by the budgetary restraints that are being imposed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, if not more.

It will provide differentiated IP for services and extensive vertical capability in key industries. We will provide IPG a base for content management platform. It will, over time, significantly enhance HP's financial profile. And the board believes that the transaction is accretive to HP's non-GAAP earnings in its first full year after completion. Autonomy, as a business, has a very profitable financial model with a very compelling value proposition, and they have been able to link solutions into 400 OEMs, which shows that they are basically a de facto industry standard. Autonomy has grown its revenues at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 55% and adjusted operating profit at a rate of approximately 83% over the last 5 years. So we're buying a very strong business, and we believe we can extract a lot more out of this business by combining it with HP. And that was the justification for the price."

And in fact, we are actually competing rather well. Our market share is, of course, the vast majority of our businesses are either stable and in some cases, we actually managed to eke out some additional gains. The second thing you have to consider in this question is are there any specific issues affecting our business in particular. Now, we're all facing some macro trends, the entire industry. And we'll all work through this. What HP is facing, in addition to the macro trends, are essentially the following things: We are being challenged on the Business Critical Systems, and we are dealing with that. We talked about it in our prepared remarks, and we had a specific issue that is in our Printing business, which was impacted by the Japanese situation. Overall, though, we have one issue that we really want to tackle in this company and that is our productivity and sales force. That is something that we really want to work hard on. We're going to work diligently to create a better platform for HP's unified solutions to go to market so that we can extract way more value out of our sales force. Our global accounts, we'll be driving operational and process excellence as well. And we are now going to have a regular cadence and discipline, how we're strategically managing major account in this company. So that's what we're intending to do and I'll leave it at that at this moment in time."

Because what I'm trying to understand is if you don't either shut down this business or sell it, it would be very difficult to get this segment to break even. So for example, if you pursue a licensing model to get to $300 million, assuming $5 per device, you'd have to sell more than 60 million licenses.

It is indeed a lot of news. Let me put it all in some perspective for you. Today is all about rising shareholder values and addressing the challenges we face in our business. But most of all, today is about transforming HP for the future. I've now been here as CEO for 9 months. I've looked at all of the businesses. I examined each in depth and carefully considered a path forward. These are tough decisions. There are 4 elements to that path. Let me summarize them, and then I'll talk about each in turn. First, secular trends impacting our PSG business as consumers are changing the use of the PC. The tablet effect is real and sales of the TouchPad are not meeting our expectations. We see the opportunity for PSG to compete and win in the PC marketplace, and our board has authorized us to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP through a spinoff or other transaction. The contemplated direction is an important component of our strategy to sharpen HP's focus on cloud, solutions and software, accessible to any type of device, while we continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including printing hardware, software and services. 
Second, our Enterprise Service business needs to be reshaped as we have discussed the last 2 quarters. That effort is well underway, and today, we will announce a new dealer for that unit. 
Third, there are technical issues that we are facing. The challenge to our Business Critical Systems business due to the Oracle Itanium issue is real, and we are addressing that. And we are confronting the challenge of the Japanese earthquake in our Printing business and still face, again, headwinds. 
And fourth, we must create more strategic relationships with our customers that will come from delivering value-added IP. Our focus on building a successful software business has momentum, and we are going to accelerate that today with the acquisition of Autonomy. 
Now let me address each of these topics in turn. First, the velocity of change in the personal device marketplace continues to increase, and the competitive landscape is growing increasingly more complex, especially around the personal computing arena. There's a clear secular movement in the consumer PC space. The impact of the economy has impacted consumer sales and the tablet effect is real. And our TouchPad has not been gaining enough traction in the marketplace. For our PC business to remain the world's largest personal computing business, it needs the flexibility and agility to make decisions best for its future direction. That is why the Board of Directors has authorized our management team to explore strategic alternatives for PSG. We intend to evaluate a range of options that may include, among others, a separation of PSG from HP through a spinoff or other transaction. We anticipate that we will take 12 to 18 months to complete this process. Meanwhile, we will be very focused on continuing to drive profitable growth and execution in PSG for HP's customers, trading partners and employees, who have continued to demonstrate PSG's market leadership, ingenuity and innovation. Additionally, we have been tracking closely the progress of webOS and analyzing its operational performance and market opportunities. We were successful at launching software that was poised with differentiated user experience. We know that many developers feel the operating system is elegantly designed and is a respected platform. Therefore, we are exploring options for how best to optimize the value of webOS software going forward. However, our webOS devices have not gained enough traction in the marketplace with consumers and we see too long a ramp up in the market share. Due to market dynamics, significant competition and a rapidly changing environment and this week's news only reiterates the speed and nature of this change, continuing to execute our current device approach in this market space is no longer in the best interest of HP and HP's shareholders. Therefore, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to shut down the webOS hardware provisions within Q4 2011. Transformation can involve difficult decisions, but we take these steps to better position for the future. 
Second, let's take a look at services. As we have discussed the past 2 quarters, we're focused on transforming our Services business. While I feel good about the progress and increased level of rigor we're building, I reiterate that this will be a multi-quarter journey. There are also areas requiring increased discipline and improved processes. On the investment side, we continue to invest in emerging services to accelerate growth, including cloud, industry solutions and analytics. We are also focused on addressing sales, delivery and business development challenges. We are working to better manage our skills supply in order to more effectively meet customer demand. We are rigorously conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we're optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. 
I'm very pleased to announce that effective immediately John Visentin will become the new EVP of Enterprise Services and he will report directly to me. John has a solid track record of success in this arena. Previously, he served as general manager of IBM's Integrated Technology Services unit for North America. John has brought his extensive experience to HP where he has been fully invested in our business for the past several months in the Americas region and is already demonstrating his leadership. I welcome him to our Executive Council. Following her recent appointment to the HP Board of Directors, Anne Livermore will fully transition out of the day-to-day operations. I look forward to her continued contributions to HP as a member of our board, and I thank her for her interim leadership of our Services business and for her support. 
Third, we must address some of the technical challenges facing our business. In Business Critical Systems, we firmly believe that HP Itanium-based server platform is by far the best in the industry, and we are fully committed to its future. In fact, it is the strength of this platform that is likely behind all those approach to drive customers away from HP technology. We are doing everything we can, including pursuing legal actions, to protect our customers and our business against all anti-customer behavior. 
In IPG, we have seen revenue and margin challenges from Japan due to laser shortages caused by the earthquake in Japan and the margin impact from the rising yen. Cathie will detail more of this in a moment, but I think HP has done a good job in managing the crisis. The speed and the size of the yen movement created a margin headwind for us in Q3, and at this yen levels, we expect there will be a continued headwind going forward. 
Fourth, I'd like to discuss our move to drive more value-added IP into our portfolio. We laid out a strategic vision in March, and I'm ever more convinced it's the right one. We will continue to expand and leverage our strong technologies, including hardware, printing, software and services. We will invest in our HP strategy focused on cloud and solutions and the software underpinning it all, including pick data analytics and securities. And we will move more firmly to higher margin growth opportunities that position HP for more strategic customer relationships. 
When we acquired Vertica earlier this year, we talked about how it enhance our capabilities for information optimization by adding a sophisticated realtime predictive analytical capability for large and complex sets of data. The emerging trend we saw at that time has now accelerated and reached the point where there is an opportunity for us to shape the industry's information and data market. We believe we can build the next generation information platform to reinvent how information is processed, analyzed, optimized, automated and protected, both for unstructured and structured data. And just to be clear, structured data is about database or transactional data. Unstructured data is all about how all of us interact naturally through e-mails, video, text, voice and social media. That is why I'm excited today to announce our plans to acquire Autonomy, the leading enterprise information management software company specialized in unstructured data. 
Before I outline the strategic rationale behind this deal, let me give you some financial highlights. Today, we announced the terms of a recommended transaction under which HP will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Autonomy for GBP 25.50 per share in cash. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for HP shareholders in the first full year following completion. It is not a profit forecast for all 28.6 of the City Code of United Kingdom. And we expect to complete the acquisition of Autonomy by the end of calendar 2011. This is a milestone moment because there is a very real and concrete need for our customers to address the explosion of unstructured and structured information. Autonomy's intelligent data operating layer is the effective standard on our more than 400 OEMs and is supported by substantial IP. Additionally, the Autonomy platform, both structured and unstructured data, from a broad range of sources, and they offer their product via both traditional software license and cloud mode. Autonomy today is one of the largest cloud players with over 30 petabytes of customer information under management via the cloud-based archiving and backup solution. They have over 25,000 customers globally. Autonomy sees the information transformation and subsequent market opportunity exactly as we do. Moreover, Autonomy business is well aligned to HP's effort to change and focus our business mix. In 2010, Autonomy had gross margins in the high 80s and operating margins above 40%. They have demonstrated a strong, consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth. Mike Lynch, Autonomy's co-founder and CEO, heads a team of brilliant scientists and employees. Additionally, operationally, the 2 companies and cultures will blend together well. Reporting directly to me, Mike will continue to lead Autonomy, which will continue to operate separately so we can keep them focused on their own market momentum, while at the same time they can play a key role in enabling the opportunities we see and the strategy we've outlined for HP. 
As an executive who has spent most of my career primarily in software, it is a world I know well. Some acquisitions require heavy lifting, but bringing Autonomy into the HP world will be seamless and highly complementary. We believe this transaction will unlock synergies within Autonomy and the HP enterprise offerings, including ESSN, software, services and IPG and across multiple industry verticals. We are building a strong HP software business. We have done so through successful acquisitions like ArcSight and Fortify. We have had excellent growth and performance this year from our software units, so the acquisition of Autonomy will build on that momentum and accelerate our HP software strategy. 
We all have witnessed an increased level of market volatility and especially today. So you might ask if a move like Autonomy is right in this market. But the market fluctuations does not change. The underlying opportunity, the value proposition of HP and Autonomy and the need to transform HP's business to create a stronger company. And most importantly, we very strongly believe the transaction will create significant value for our shareholders. All of the decisive moves I've made provide HP with the most shareholder returns, markets where we can demonstrate a sustainable competitive advantage, maximize customer value, deliver on our solutions vision, differentiate with IP and win. We are focusing on what needs to be fixed, what needs to be shut down and what needs to be considered for separation. And equally, if not more importantly, we are focused on what value added IP needs to be added to HP in order to stay a leader in the IT world and represent a true value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Lastly, I'd like to make a comment on guidance. I'm lowering the Q4 guidance to be realistic about where we are and the challenges we are facing. These challenges and the transformation we are undertaking will take several quarters to fully resolve. I don't take this action lightly. I know our investors don't like being in this position and neither do I. I feel their pain. But as CEO, I believe in transparency about what we are facing and be clear on the decisive things we are doing now about it. To conclude, I'm taking ownership for these decisions and investments with a focus on driving actions that deliver value for shareholders as we shape the new HP. Now, let's take a look at the numbers with Cathie."
108856,117489370,160725,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, LÃ©o .

Today, we're delivering a tough outlook, definitely the most difficult one for me as CFO. LÃ©o has walked you through the details of the steps we are taking and how they will lay the foundation for transforming and rebuilding Hewlett-Packard. Let me review our Q3 results to set some context for our outlook. Revenue of $31.2 billion was up 1.5% year-over-year, but down 2 points in constant currency. By geography, revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 9% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas was flat year-on-year, but down 2% in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was also flat year-over-year, but down 5% in constant currency. Company level gross margin of 23.3% was down 70 basis points year-over-year and down 130 basis points sequentially. Our Printing, Services and webOS businesses posted lower gross margin rates, which were partially offset by a favorable commodity pricing environment in PSG and ESSN. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with increases in R&D and field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.8% was down 140 basis points, with operating profit down 11% year-over-year. And we generated $3 billion in earnings from operations compared to $3.4 billion a year ago and down 14% sequentially. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $121 million and our tax rate remained at 22%. Third quarter non-GAAP net income of $2.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.10. Share count declined 12% year-over-year to $2.08 billion as we repurchased 128 million shares in the quarter for a total of $4.6 billion. HP generated $3.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $10.2 billion year-to-date. 
Now, turning to the business unit performance. The Personal Systems Group, which remains the number one PC business across notebooks and desktops with 18.1% share, delivered revenue of $9.6 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Operating profit for this segment was up 21% year-over-year to $567 million or 5.9% of revenue. This is up 120 basis points year-over-year, largely due to lower component costs and favorable customer mix. Commercial Client revenue grew 9%, led by another strong quarter in workstations, which generated 19% revenue growth. Total Consumer Client revenue was down 17% versus the year-ago quarter. Both desktop and notebook were down 4% year-over-year as both segments continue to be equally affected by the weakness in the consumer demand. 
Corporate Investments, which includes webOS, recorded revenue of $266 million and an operating loss of $332 million in the quarter. About a year ago, we made a bet on webOS and the opportunity to launch our own ecosystem around devices, applications and new markets. At that time, we set clear metrics and milestones to monitor the success of webOS. We launched the flagship product, the TouchPad, on July 1. And frankly, the software was met by strong reviews, but the sell-through of the product was not what we expected. Our intention was to solidify webOS as the clear number 2 platform for tablet. But with such a young ecosystem and poorly received hardware, we were unable to achieve our target. Additionally, it quickly became clear that pricing parity would not generate demand and we subsequently lowered TouchPad pricing by $100, which has added incremental near-term cost to our model. Even with the price reduction in Q3, we needed to better align our unit forecast with the sell-through reality in the quarter, and we took a $0.05 charge to EPS in addition to the loss we were already expecting in the business. We would expect an even larger loss for webOS in Q4 if we continue to operate the business in its current form. Essentially, the TouchPad and our webOS phone have not met our financial targets and other milestones that were set. To make this investment a financial success would require significant investments over the next 1 to 2 years, creating risk without clear returns. Therefore, we have decided to shut down operations around webOS devices and we'll be exploring strategic alternatives to optimize the value of the software platform and development capability.
Turning to Imaging and Printing, we delivered net revenue of $6.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. The Q3 Japan impact, resulting primarily from the LaserJet hardware and toner constraints, was about what we expected in terms of revenue and operating profit on our Commercial business. Commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year, with commercial hardware units up 1%. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year on 7% unit growth. In total, printer units were up 6% year-over-year. IPG continues to lead the market in innovation. Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 23% year-over-year, and we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers again this quarter. Supplies revenue was flat year-over-year at $4.1 billion. We ended the quarter with higher than normal channel inventory in supplies, especially ink, as sell-through slowed at the end of the quarter. Our Supplies business tends to follow the economy, and given the current market uncertainty, we're remaining cautious. We'll need to begin working through this inventory and the resulting mix shift toward hardware is expected to have a revenue and margin impact over the next few quarters. In Q3, operating profit for IPG totaled $892 million or 14.7% of revenue, down 220 basis points year-over-year. Roughly 1/2 of the operating profit decline year-over-year was due to laser toner supply shortages caused by the tsunami in Japan and 1/2 was due to the rising yen. The speed and the size of the yen movement created a margin headwind for us in Q3 and at these yen levels, we expect there will be a continued headwind going forward. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but was down 2% in constant currency. We delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue, down 220 basis points from the prior year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we're focused on driving a greater mix of higher value-added services. This means investing in delivery and business development resources, as well as developing industry-specific services practices and IP. We're also improving our tools and processes while adding more management rigor at the account level. We've been conducting systematic account reviews to ensure that we're optimizing value for our customers and results for HP. These investments and incremental process improvements are expected to generate mid- to long-term growth, but they continue to put pressure on HP Services margins. Our services transformation is a 4- to 6-quarter journey, and we expect our services margin to be roughly 12.5% during this time. 
IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Signings were largely driven by renewals in an environment of contractual price reductions and competition. While these renewals help to protect revenue backlog, we need to work on new logos and add-on deals to generate sustainable revenue growth. ITO is focused on improving its revenue growth and margins through new service offerings, including Enterprise Cloud services. We are also methodically working to improve profitability at some legacy accounts that have lower gross margins. 
Application Services revenue was up 2% year-over-year, and we continue to invest in the business and pursue application modernization services, security, private and hybrid cloud services and analytics. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 9% year-over-year, including a 4-point headwind from the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO and revenue runoff that was only partially offset by the volume increase in healthcare. Technology Services revenue grew 5%, with strong order growth in TS Consulting Services. We continue to gain strong traction with our Cloud Workshop. 
Enterprise server, storage and networking grew revenue 7% to $5.4 billion. Operating profit of $699 million was down 1% and operating margin of 13% was down 110 basis points from the prior year. Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue and incremental investments in sales and R&D. Across ESSN, we are seeing a slower economic environment and expect below normal sequential growth going forward. Our industry-standard servers remain number 1 in share across all 3 regions, with revenue growth of 9%, and we expect to show share gains for calendar Q2. While we remain well positioned in the fastest growing areas of the market, we expect ISS year-over-year growth to slow in the fourth quarter, driven by a very difficult prior year comparison and the slowing demand environment I mentioned earlier.  HP remains number one in the blade server market, with roughly half the market and grew ESS blade revenues 15% year-over-year. 
Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 9% year-over-year. This decline is sharper than expected as our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's Itanium decision and orders are being delayed or canceled. We are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. 
Our HP storage portfolio is in transition. Overall, HP Storage revenue increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 17% growth in external disk products. Our products, based on StoreOnce data deduplication technology, had another strong quarter and 3PAR sales continue to accelerate, achieving triple-digit revenue growth year-over-year on a normalized basis. Partially offsetting growth in these key areas were year-over-year declines in our tape and EVA product lines. 
HP Networking grew 15% year-over-year, the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit growth. Switching and routing, including Virtual Connect, grew 18% while our major competitors are seeing declines in their networking businesses. We are expanding our presence in core data center enterprises, with more than 30 new logos in Q3. We feel good about our business model, customer value proposition and ability to continue gaining share. 
Turning to HP Software. We delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $780 million, up 20% compared with the prior year, including 29% license growth, 30% services revenue growth and 12% support revenue growth. Our newest security solutions, ArcSight and Fortify, continue to generate double-digit growth on an operational basis as did the BTO business. Third quarter operating profit was $151 million or 19.4% of revenue. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 22% to $932 million. Financing volume increased 16% and net portfolio assets increased 17%. Operating profit of $88 million is up 22% year-over-year to 9.4% of revenue. 
Now, on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $13 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 9 days from the prior year, due primarily to a back end loaded quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 6 days from the prior year. Inventory days were flat and days payable decreased 3 days. Channel inventories are within acceptable ranges for PSG and ESSN, but higher than we would like for IPG, as I described earlier. HP generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $11.3 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking forward, HP continues to be challenged by macro uncertainties that may impact each of our businesses, both consumer and commercial. We are also working to transform our Services business, which will take time. Given the variability and changes in our operating model as we execute this significant transformation, we are removing our long-term financial target of a $7 EPS in 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP expectations are: First, we expect revenue to be in the range of $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion, which is below our normal seasonality, given the macro environment, higher channel inventory and printing supplies and our ongoing services transformation. Second, we expect the operating margins on the Services business to be roughly 12.5%. Third, we expect OI&E expense of approximately $150 million, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. We expect only moderate reduction in weighted average shares outstanding in Q4 as a result of Q3 repurchases that occurred late in the quarter. Thus, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 and $1.16. For GAAP guidance, we expect to take a GAAP-only cash charge of approximately $1 billion for restructuring and shutdown costs related to webOS devices. In addition, as of July 31, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately $1.2 billion per Palm. 
As we work through strategic alternatives for webOS software, we will evaluate these assets for any potential impairment, and if appropriate, recognize a related noncash charge. We expect to have a $300 million to $400 million GAAP-only expense due to the cost of the British pound options we're buying to hedge the purchase price of the Autonomy transaction. Thus, we expect fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.44 and $0.55. For the full year FY '11, we expect revenue to be $127.2 billion to $127.6 billion. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.82 and $4.86 per share. We expect full year GAAP EPS to be between $3.59 and $3.70 and cash flow from operations to be roughly $12 billion and free cash flow of $8 billion, including the cash charge associated with the shutdown of webOS devices. 
We are repositioning our portfolio, discontinuing or exploring options for lower margin businesses and investing in higher margin areas, including Services and Software. This effort will require patience, but the clear objective is to drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over LÃ©o.."

And when you look at our ESSN business, you will see that we had actually good performance across the entire board of our various offerings. What is important to note is that the public sector, which counts for about 10% of our business, has been impacted by the budgetary restraints that are being imposed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, if not more.

In a couple of months since becoming HP's CEO, I've spent time of our people, our leadership team, our customers and our investors. I've seen and heard a lot of great things. We have unmatched strengths to build on. #1 or #2 positions in nearly all of our businesses, customers who want us to win, intellectual property, global scale and reach that are unmatched and employees who are smart, committed and resilient. What else didn't live up to our expectations in 2011. We need to get back to doing what we do really well, being the reliable, trusted partner with whom our customers want to work and delivering the reliable system results that all of you can count on. 
When I took this role, the team established 3 short-term priorities: deliver on the Q4 outlook; accelerate the decision on PSG and get Autonomy off to a good start within HP. So let me give you a quick update. First, we delivered Q4 and Cathie will give you more color on that in a few minutes. Second, we completed our analysis on PSG, and the response from all corners has been overwhelmingly positive. There's no question in our minds, HP and PSG are better together. Third, we closed the Autonomy acquisition October 3. In the last month, we've had hundreds of leads passed between the 2 companies, and we've created a new information management business group, that combines Autonomy, Vertica and other HP software assets under Mike Lynch and reports directly to me. 
So we're off to a solid start, but I also know that it's going to be important to provide as much clarity as possible about our future because over the course of last year and certainly on our last earnings call in August, we confused customers, employees, shareholders and partners on one fundamental issue around HP's strategy. As I travel, the one question I keep getting is, ""What is HP?"" 
Well, here's the first part of that answer. HP is the largest provider of information technology infrastructure, software, services and solutions to individuals and organizations of all sizes. We have incredible scale and breadth, and that's a powerful advantage that we know how to make the most of. We're a leader in PCs, printers, servers, storage, networking, services and information, automation and management software. 
HP has a great platform from which to build. And to be clear, we're in the software business to deliver value for our customers, not to transform HP into a software company. We bring the breadth and depth of our portfolio to meet customers' toughest problems, and we will continue to invest in our solutions through both internal innovations and M&A. 
We increased our R&D spend in FY '11 by nearly 10%. We launched some outstanding new products and drove innovation into the marketplace. In fact, just 3 weeks ago, we became the first large server vendor to announce new, extreme low-energy server technology code-named Moonshot. This is a revolutionary architecture that uses 89% less energy, 94% less space and 63% less cost. That is meaningful and exciting innovation, and in 2012, we plan to do more of the same and to increase our R&D investment once again. 
We've also seen good traction with our recent acquisitions. 3PAR, 3Com, Fortify and ArcSight. All are experiencing strong double-digit or better growth and are taking advantage of HP's global distribution. 
Our software business has now posted several strong quarters in a row, demonstrating our success at integrating these new companies. Our IT Performance Suite and Security platform are unique and winning in the industry, and I'm also excited about the future of Autonomy as part of HP. 
HP has all the components of an outstanding company but we're not taking full advantage and leveraging these parts to drive the results where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We need to be simpler, clearer and more consistent. No more surprises. We need to articulate a clear direction from business strategy to financial strategy to capital allocation strategy. 
While I won't be communicating all the answers today, the executive team is hard at work on this. One thing we do know is that we're getting back to the basics of executing business fundamentals, which frankly, we struggled with in FY '11. 
So what made FY '11 such a challenging year and what are we doing differently in 2012? Let's start with the full 2011 results. We grew revenue 1%, non-GAAP EPS 7% and free cash flow 8%, and we generated $12.6 billion of cash flow from operations. While this was not HP's best annual performance, generating nearly $13 billion of cash flow is a good, healthy result. 
We faced some challenges that increased throughout the year and will continue into FY '12, some were in HP's control and others were not. Some will take time to resolve, others are more short-term in nature. 
First, we increased our investment levels through fiscal year '11 because there are areas where HP had previously underinvested. This is a big reason why our Services margins have been coming down and remain pressured. And we also increased OpEx to drive more innovation and a bigger, better sales force. These are the right things to do for HP's future, and looking forward, we'll continue to invest organically. This includes investments in our people, intellectual property and services capabilities. 
We'll also increase our investments in IT systems and in processes to enhance our scale advantages. We'll be selective about the areas where we invest, and we'll monitor our performance and make adjustments as needed. 
Second, HP as a company known for its execution but we did not execute consistently in FY '11. I'm a big believer in prioritization. Pick the things you need to accomplish, knock them down, pick up the next ones. We're doing this in each of our business, and I'm confident that we will restore the execution consistency that we all expect. 
Third, we faced unplanned challenges outside our immediate control, many of which still remain. The macroeconomic picture became increasingly uncertain through FY '11, and we're remaining cautious about 2012. Our Consumer business was down throughout 2011, and the Commercial business slowed down as the year went on. Using Q4 as a baseline, Consumer was down 9% and Commercial was down 2% year-over-year. 
We also confronted one-time issues like the natural disaster in Japan, and now we're facing the flooding in Thailand. We'll do our best to mitigate these external impacts but prudent expectations are appropriate. 
Finally, HP went through a large number of distractions last year that affected performance. We had a CEO change, strategic shift and many new cycles. We also deployed significant capital in 2011 through share repurchases, acquisitions and in increasing dividends. Through this, we created confusion with many of our shareholders about what kind of company HP is. 
As we move ahead, I'm very focused on being clear with all of you about who we are and on continuing to drive strong financial discipline. Our strategic decisions will have solid financial underpinnings, just like our PSG decision did. Each of our businesses will use their respective levers to drive profitable growth, but we'll manage HP as one company and ultimately, we'll measure ourselves by the company's earnings per share. As a result, we're modifying our guidance approach to focus only on EPS at a company level. 
To summarize, HP is getting back to business fundamentals in 2012. We'll make smart investments, fix our execution challenges, plan prudently and drive strong financial discipline. Our near-term focus is on driving execution and investing for the future, but frankly, many of the FY '11 headwinds are still with us. We're expecting to climb to both revenue and profits in FY '12 but we'll be doing the hard work that will position us for consistent, profitable growth in 2013 and beyond. 
HP will continue to be a strong generator of cash, and I know many of you want more clarity on our capital allocation plan. I can tell you that we'll be pursuing a disciplined and balanced approach. You should assume in 2012 that HP will be rebuilding its balance sheet and will not be doing any large M&A. Additionally, you should expect that share repurchases and dividends will continue to be a core part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
Over the long term, we expect HP to be a GDP-type growth company that can grow revenue in line or better than our markets, grow earnings faster than revenue and produce consistent cash flow. I'm optimistic and confident about HP's potential over the next several years. Don't get me wrong. We have work to do and it will take time but we have some of the best core franchises in technology, a solid earnings and cash flow base, customers who want to do more business with us, a world-class leadership team and people who are motivated to win. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

HP is well positioned and committed to delivering value for our customers and investors. HP has a broad portfolio of industry-leading technology and capabilities, and we must use these assets to achieve our financial goals and create shareholder value. For fiscal 2012, we will focus on the business fundamentals of operational excellence and financial discipline to make this happen. 
Let's review the Q4 results to set some context for our outlook. Non-GAAP revenue of $32.3 billion was down 3% as reported or 6% in constant currency year-on-year. Note that our non-GAAP revenue excludes net GAAP revenue associated with the wind-down of our webOS hardware business in Q4. 
By geography, non-GAAP revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 3% but declined 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue in the Americas decreased 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency versus the prior-year period, and non-GAAP revenue in EMEA was down 6% as reported and 10% in constant currency. 
Company-level non-GAAP gross margin of 23.2% was down 170 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially. Gross margins were impacted by the strong yen and a lower mix of printing supplies, as well as continued margin pressure in Services. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the increase in field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7% was down 230 basis points year-over-year with $3.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
The bridge from operating profit to our earnings per share includes the following: Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $125 million; our tax rate remained at 22%. Additionally, we repurchased 17 million shares in the quarter for $500 million. Share count as a result declined 13% year-over-year to 2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 12% to $1.17 and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.12. 
There were several adjustments earnings in Q4 that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. First, we took a total charge to operating income of $788 million. This was associated with the wind-down of our webOS device business. This charge included a net revenue reduction of $142 million related to the sales incentive program, $548 million in cost of sales due to supplier-related obligations and inventory reserves and $98 million in operating expenses and restructuring charges. 
Second, as a result of our decision to wind down webOS devices, we have taken an impairment expense of $885 million against a carrying value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of Palm. 
Finally, the expense related to the British pound options we bought to limit our exchange rate risk in connection with the Autonomy acquisition was $276 million, a bit less than what we had guided in August. 
Now turning to our performance by business. The Personal Systems Group delivered a revenue of $10.1 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. The segment delivered 2% operating profit growth year-over-year with a 5.7% operating margin. Workstations continue to produce double-digit revenue growth, contributing to the 5% growth in Commercial Client revenue year-over-year. 
Consumer Client revenue was down 9% versus the year-ago quarter with notebooks seeing a bigger decline than desktop. Total units shipped were up 2% year-over-year but with average selling price declines, we saw no growth in desktop revenue year-over-year and a 4% decline in notebook revenue. Both form factors continue to be affected by weakness in consumer demand. 
Turning to Imaging and Printing. We delivered net revenue of $6.3 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to channel inventory reductions, broad-based weakness in EMEA and softening consumer demand, particularly for supplies. In Q4, operating profit for IPG totaled $808 million or 12.8% of revenue, down 460 basis points year-over-year. Margins were unfavorably affected by the strong yen and lower-than-normal supplies mix of 64% as we continue to work down the high supplies channel inventory we discussed last quarter. 
Commercial Printer revenue was up 4% year-over-year, with commercial hardware units up 5%. Consumer Printer revenue was down 8% year-over-year, with an 8% decline in unit. In total, printer unit shipments were down 5% year-over-year. 
Indigo Digital Press Page volume was up 20% year-over-year, and we shipped more than 9 million web-connected printers this quarter, beating our target of 20 million web-connected printers by the end of fiscal 2011. 
Supplies revenue declined 14% year-over-year to $4 billion in the quarter. Remember, we entered Q4 with higher channel inventory than we would've liked, and we worked to reduce this throughout the quarter. As we said last quarter, supplies revenue closely follows economic cycles. Continue to be impacted by softness in consumer demand as a result of continued pressure on unemployment globally and was below our expectations in the quarter. We ended the quarter with higher channel inventory than we would've liked in some regions. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.3 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter but down 1% in constant currency. Operating profit of $1.2 billion or 12.8% of revenue was down 360 basis points from the prior year. Our Services turnaround will take time as we work to shift the business mix towards higher growth, higher margin services. 
IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Application Services revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 2% year-over-year, and Technology Services revenue grew 3% with double-digit growth in TS Consulting Services. 
Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. Across ESSN, we are seeing the effects of a slower economic environment. Operating profit of $733 million was down 17% year-over-year, and the operating margin of 13% was 210 basis points below the prior year. 
Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue, competitive pricing pressure and incremental investments in sales and R&D. As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing the macro slow down impact industry-standard servers. Revenue in ISS declined 4% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 23% year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in our Itanium-based servers. Our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's Itanium decision, and we are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. 
Our HP Storage portfolio showed revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, with 11% growth in our external disk products, and once again, triple-digit growth in 3PAR. Year-over-year declines in our tape and EVA product lines partially offset this growth. 
HP Networking grew 5% year-over-year, and Enterprise Switching and Routing grew 7% from the prior-year period. We feel good about our business model and customer value proposition, and we added 15 new logos in the quarter. We expect to continue to gain market share in Switching and Routing. 
Turning to HP Software. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $976 million, up 28% compared with the prior year, including 33% license growth, 36% services revenue growth and 20% support revenue growth. Our security offering continues to do well, and the IT Performance Suite offers enterprises a comprehensive solution for managing their infrastructure and applications. 
Overall, fourth quarter operating profit for HP software was $270 million or 28% of revenue. We closed the acquisition of Autonomy in October, and therefore, we had roughly one month of results in the software numbers. The integration is going well thus far, and we are focused on enabling our global sales force to ramp on the Autonomy product line up so they can begin selling Autonomy software in fiscal '12. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $952 million. Financing volume increased 12%, and net portfolio assets increased 12%. Operating profit of $98 million is up 34% year-over-year to 10.3% of revenue. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended fiscal '11 with total gross cash of $8.1 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 5 days from the prior year, primarily due to a 4-day increase in inventory days. Day sales outstanding increased one day from the prior year, and days payable were flat year-over-year. Panel inventories are a bit higher than we would like in some regions but within acceptable ranges at the company level. 
HP generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and $239 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $10.8 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Today, we are providing our outlook for both the first fiscal quarter and the full year 2012. We will continue to be transparent about the tailwinds and headwinds that our respective businesses are facing. We will no longer be providing quantitative revenue or segment level outlook. 
We will be managing the business towards earnings performance rather than particular revenue growth objectives, and we will continue to provide earnings per share outlook, consistent with how we are managing HP's performance as one company. Here are some color on our assumptions relating to revenue and earnings for the coming year. Based on what we saw in Q4, the macro environment remains uncertain globally and particularly in Europe. Consumer spending remains soft, and we have begun to see a slowdown in commercial spending. We expect these dynamics will lead to below normal sequential revenue performance in Q1 and year-over-year revenue declines through 2012. 
From a business perspective, we expect the decline in our Business Critical Systems business will remain a headwind throughout the year. Additionally, during the first half of the year, we expect to experience headwinds associated with the flooding in Thailand, affecting hard disk drive supply primarily within PSG but also across ESSN. We also expect a slow correction in our IPG channel inventory level. 
Moving onto margins. In fiscal 2012, we will continue to be focused on profitable revenue but we expect our margins will be impacted by several factors: First, the overall decline in revenue will impact margins at the company level. Second, we are seeing a competitive pricing environment across our transactional businesses. Third, we expect an impact due to the lower mix of Business Critical Systems. At the same time, we are investing in our services turnaround, which is driving an increase in costs due to delivery and sales personnel in that business. And we will continue to invest in innovation and in systems and processes needed to improve performance across all of our businesses over time. 
We will have increased other interest expense due to the change in our capital structure with more debt. We expect OI&E to be an expense of roughly $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year. And finally, we expect our tax rate to remain at 22% for the full year. 
With that as context, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.86. We expect first quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.61 and $0.64. For the full year fiscal '12, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4, and we expect full year GAAP EPS to be at least $3.20. 
In conclusion, HP is making strategic investments in our people and our processes this year to enhance the core strength of HP and to build upon our leadership positions across hardware, software, services and solution. Meg and I will watch these expenditures closely against expected returns, making adjustments as required. 
In the end, we expect to be a stronger, more consistent performer, creating value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean, we have taken a prudent approach, Bill, to 2012 and Q1 guidance by modeling the year-over-year decline throughout the year. And I think it really falls into 3 buckets for me. First is that 1/3 is macroeconomic forces. We're seeing headwinds in all 3 regions, particularly in Europe. And we are also aggressively working through the Thailand situation, which will, I think, affect us in Q1 and Q2. The third bucket of things that we're looking at is HP-specific issues, and this is where we are making some investments. We've got business challenges that actually need to be sorted out. So first of all, we are driving more again organic innovation with R&D. The R&D investment in virtually every business we are taking up this year after an increase last year but it is absolutely required. If we're going to get out of the M&A business, a big M&A, we've got to actually invest in R&D. We also have a services turnaround on our hands ago. And while that isn't R&D investment per se, that is investment in sales, and it is investment in people who can actually deliver the product that we want to deliver in services. And then the last area is sales force. We did invest in sales force last year. We've made -- we've trimmed some of that expense but we are making another investment this year in coverage, in big accounts where I think there is a lot more revenue for HP. So those would be the 3 major areas of investments that we're going to make in 2012. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?"

The other thing, Bill, you should take into consideration in your modeling is the fact that we will continue to see a decline in our Business Critical Systems business. It's going to be continue to be a headwind for our Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking margins. The strength of the yen. So at the end -- in Q4, the yen was up again quarter-on-quarter -- sorry, the year-on-year strength in the year and that's going to continue to be a headwind for our IPG business. And then the other spot I would call out is that there are 2 impacts that are predominantly first half. So we would put the channel inventory corrections for the IPG supplies. We believe by the end of Q2, we will have gotten the level in the channel kind of roughly in line with what we think the demand is. So that's a first half event. And then the other first half, we think that the impact from the Thailand flooding on the hard disk drive availability starts to be alleviated by the end of the first half as well. So we've got those 2 impacts that help us in the second half as we work through them.

Now, I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this company has always been focused on profitability but I think the better measure of our success as a management team is going to be on EPS growth and revenue growth -- I'm sorry, EPS growth and cash flow. So that's the reason that we're doing that.

I completely believe that this is not a secular trend decline in Printing, that there is more information, more things to be printed, more people love the capacity of print than ever before. In my view, and I've only been here 8 weeks, this is all about correcting a higher-than-normal supplies in the channel that what got put into the channel in Q1 and Q2, I think, the slowdown in Q3 and Q4 was a surprise to us, particularly on the commercial side but also on the consumer side. And what we know from years in this business is that supplies are almost a perfect predictor of economic health of almost any region. And so I think what you're seeing is consumers and small businesses, in particular, are worried about the economic environment and they're not buying as much printing supplies. But I do not think that this is a secular trend. Obviously, we are making an investment in things like graphics, in ePrint, in a whole host of things that actually increase the amount of printing.

We set up a war room. We began pulling inventory and made strategic of hard drives back in early October. And so I think we will get more than our fair share of drives here because of the long-term relationships that we have with our suppliers because we were on this really fast.

And my observations are that most companies are coming slightly below normal seasonality for this quarter. You came in dramatically below normal seasonality. ISS grew at minus 4%, IBM was at plus 1%, Dell was at 12%, looks like you lost share. PCs market grew at 3% to 4%, you grew at 2% in units. IPG grew more than 10 points slower than Lexmark. Just some simple benchmarking would actually suggest that you're losing share. And so the question is why do you believe that this is predominantly macro? Do you believe that you're as competitive as you ought to be?

So I would say, if you look at 2011, there were 3 buckets of problems for HP, and I would say the weaker performance than we would've liked in 2007 is allocatable about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. A third is macroeconomic trends and we saw pretty significant -- the consumer was weak all year for us, and the Commercial segment weakened in Q3 and Q4 so no denying that. I mean, I think we absolutely saw that. I would say 1/3 of our challenges in 2011 were HP-specific, absolutely, whether it was the channel in IPG, whether it was China in PSG. We were hurt disproportionately in China from the NVIDIA recall, the Intel recall and then no question, our mid-August announcement hurt us in China more than any other market. And frankly, I think there was some brand damage to us. At least, it created uncertainty. I mean, I had customers tell us that they thought we were getting out of the hardware business entirely. So no question, we did ourselves in there. I would say on Services, the lack of the right tools and the mix of that business, we didn't perform as well as the industry in that business in 2011. On the other hand, we had a great year in Software and a great year in Financial Services. But the other third was what I would call the distraction factor. I mean, we just need to get back to putting our heads down and get out of the news cycle and reduce the drama here. There was a lot of drama in 2011. And so I'd say looking backwards, I'd say it's 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. Going forward, listen, we still got some macroeconomic headwinds. Maybe, we're calling it out more than others but we see it, and I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen in Europe. And even our EPS guidance does not take into account a complete meltdown in Europe. And then we've got some business issues we've got to work through that I think Cathie and I have covered and hopefully, the distraction will be out of it.

That we do believe that it's a close call in terms of share from an industry standard server perspective but you've probably noticed that there's a lot of volatility in share these days in industry standard servers because you've got these big service provider deals. And if you happen to win that quarter's deal, you're going to show a lot of share gain and other people aren't, and then you're going to have tough compares because I think you have to take that into consideration as well.

We know that we've got improve our mix of higher margins, higher growth business services such as applications. And that's going to take time. And at the same time that we're doing that, we've got to carefully review everything in our portfolio to make sure that we're focused on the right services, and so that could mean deemphasizing some of the lower margin services as well. We are absolutely investing in the right tools to effectively and efficiently run this business. This is a very big business, and to date guys, we put manual processes in place in order to manage this business. This is not the way to do it. So in '11 we made some investments. In '12, we are accelerating those investments and tools for this business. We are, as we've talked before, we're investing in sales and we're adding significantly to the delivery resources because at the end of the day, happier customers are going to buy more product at higher -- at better margins. And we also -- you also have to factor in the fact that you've got these ITO deals. These large ITO deals that over are, over many years, they come on at lower margins and they run off at higher margins just because of the life cycle of an ITO deal, and we've got a bit of that going on as well. In the Technology Services space, you've got the headwind from Business Critical Servers revenue. Over time, it's going to hit us. It doesn't hit all at once. It's got a very long tail on it. I think it's important for you guys to understand this so you can think about how you model Services but the fundamental that you got to take away from this is that we're making the right investments to create a good service business despite the fact that there will be continued pressures on the margins in 2012."

We just need to make them work harder together and we need to run this company as one HP so that we can bring the full portfolio to bear to solve customer problems.

I am really excited about this acquisition. And as you all know, I think it really positions HP as a leader in the next-generation information management and analytics capabilities as the explosion of data is making these capabilities absolutely critical. And Autonomy is a unique asset. It has a remarkable ability to manage unstructured information in a way that no one else in the market does, and I think that adds a lot of value not only in their space but actually across HP. So what we've set up is Autonomy is actually running fairly autonomously. But we have done a great job, I think, of integrating the go-to-market. So there are sales leads that are going from Autonomy to HP, interestingly, which we didn't expect so much of in terms of hardware pull-through but also from our HP sales team back to Autonomy. And we've got a clearinghouse that gets all those leads so that what we turn over to Autonomy a really high quality that will allow Autonomy to grow much faster than they would've grown on their own. And that's the name of the game for 2012. There's going to do lots of other things we do together but accelerating the growth of Autonomy, using the distribution capability of HP is priority number 1, 2 and 3 for 2012 and we're really excited about it.

In a couple of months since becoming HP's CEO, I've spent time with our people, our leadership team, our customers and our investors. I've seen and heard a lot of great things. We have unmatched strengths to build on: #1 or #2 positions in nearly all of our businesses; customers who want us to win; c, intellectual property; global scale and reach that are unmatched; and employees who are smart, committed and resilient. But I also know we didn't live up to our expectations in 2011. We need to get back to doing what we do really well, being the reliable, trusted partner with whom our customers want to work and delivering the reliable, consistent results that all of you can count on. 
When I took this role, the team established 3 short-term priorities: deliver on the Q4 outlook; accelerate the decision on PSG and get Autonomy off to a good start within HP. So let me give you a quick update. First, we delivered Q4, and Cathie will give you more color on that in a few minutes. Second, we completed our analysis on PSG, and the response from all corners has been overwhelmingly positive. There's no question in our minds HP and PSG are better together. Third, we closed the Autonomy acquisition on October 3. In the last month, we've had hundreds of leads passed between the 2 companies, and we've created a new information management business group that combined Autonomy, Vertica and other HP software assets under Mike Lynch and reports directly to me. 
So we're off to a solid start. But I also know that it's going to be important to provide as much clarity as possible about our future, because over the course of last year and certainly on our last earnings call in August, we confused customers, employees, shareholders and partners on one fundamental issue around HP's strategy. 
As I travel, the one question I keep getting is, ""What is HP?"" Well, here's the first part of that answer. HP is the largest provider of information technology infrastructure, software, services and solutions to individuals and organizations of all sizes. We have incredible scale and breadth, and that's a powerful advantage that we know how to make the most of. We're a leader in PCs, printers, servers, storage, networking, services and information, automation and management software. 
HP has a great platform from which to build. And to be clear, we're in the software business to deliver value for our customers, not to transform HP into a software company. We bring the breadth and depth of our portfolio to meet customers' toughest problems, and we will continue to invest in our solutions through both internal innovation and M&A. 
We increased our R&D spend in FY '11 by nearly 10%. We launched some outstanding new products and drove innovation into the marketplace. In fact, just 3 weeks ago, we became the first large server vendor to announce new, extreme low-energy server technology code-named Moonshot. This is a revolutionary architecture that uses 89% less energy, 94% less space and 63% less cost. That is meaningful and exciting innovation. And in 2012, we plan to do more of the same and to increase our R&D investment once again. 
We've also seen good traction with our recent acquisitions. 3PAR, 3Com, Fortify and ArcSight. All are experiencing strong, double-digit or better growth and are taking advantage of HP's global distribution. 
Our software business has now posted several strong quarters in a row, demonstrating our success at integrating these new companies. Our IT Performance Suite and security platform are unique and winning in the industry. And I'm also excited about the future of Autonomy as part of HP. 
HP has all the components of an outstanding company, but we're not taking full advantage and leveraging these parts to drive the result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We need to be simpler, clearer and more consistent. No more surprises. We need to articulate a clear direction, from business strategy to financial strategy to capital allocation strategy. 
While I won't be communicating all the answers today, the executive team is hard at work on this. One thing we do know is that we're getting back to the basics of executing business fundamentals, which, frankly, we struggled with in FY '11. 
So what made FY '11 such a challenging year? And what are we doing differently in 2012? Let's start with the full 2011 results. We grew revenue 1%, non-GAAP EPS 7% and free cash flow 8%. And we generated $12.6 billion of cash flow from operations. While this was not HP's best annual performance, generating nearly $13 billion of cash flow is a good, healthy result. 
We faced some challenges that increased throughout the year and will continue into FY '12. Some were in HP's control, and others were not. Some will take time to resolve, others are more short term in nature. 
First, we increased our investment levels through fiscal year '11 because there are areas where HP had previously underinvested. This is a big reason why our Services margins have been coming down and remain pressured. And we also increased OpEx to drive more innovation and a bigger, better sales force. These are the right things to do for HP's future. And looking forward, we'll continue to invest organically. This includes investments in our people, intellectual property and services capabilities. We'll also increase our investments in IT systems and in processes to enhance our scale advantages. We'll be selective about the areas where we invest, and we'll monitor our performance and make adjustments as needed. 
Second, HP is a company known for its execution, but we did not execute consistently in FY '11. I'm a big believer in prioritization. Pick the things you need to accomplish, knock them down, pick up the next ones. We're doing this in each of our businesses, and I'm confident that we will restore the execution consistency that we all expect. 
Third, we faced unplanned challenges outside our immediate control, many of which still remain. The macroeconomic picture became increasingly uncertain through FY '11, and we're remaining cautious about 2012. Our consumer business was down throughout 2011, and the commercial business slowed down as the year went on. Using Q4 as a baseline, consumer was down 9%, and commercial was down 2% year-over-year. 
We also confronted onetime issues like the natural disaster in Japan, and now we're facing the flooding in Thailand. We'll do our best to mitigate these external impacts, but prudent expectations are appropriate. 
Finally, HP went through a large number of distractions last year that affected performance. We had a CEO change, strategic shifts and many new cycles. We also deployed significant capital in 2011 through share repurchases, acquisitions and an increase in dividends. Through this, we created confusion with many of our shareholders about what kind of company HP is. 
As we move ahead, I'm very focused on being clear with all of you about who we are and on continuing to drive strong financial discipline. Our strategic decisions will have solid financial underpinnings, just like our PSG decision did. Each of our businesses will use their respective levers to drive profitable growth. But we'll manage HP as one company. And ultimately, we'll measure ourselves by the company's earnings per share. As a result, we're modifying our guidance approach to focus only on EPS at a company level. 
To summarize, HP is getting back to business fundamentals in 2012. We'll make smart investments, fix our execution challenges, plan prudently and drive strong financial discipline. Our near-term focus is on driving execution and investing for the future. But frankly, many of the FY '11 headwinds are still with us. We're expecting to climb in both revenue and profits in FY '12, but we'll be doing the hard work that will position us for consistent, profitable growth in 2013 and beyond. 
HP will continue to be a strong generator of cash, and I know many of you want more clarity on our capital allocation plan. I can tell you that we'll be pursuing a disciplined and balanced approach. You should assume in 2012 that HP will be rebuilding its balance sheet and will not be doing any large M&A. Additionally, you should expect that share repurchases and dividends will continue to be a core part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. Over the long term, we expect HP to be a GDP-type growth company that can grow revenue in line or better than our markets, grow earnings faster than revenue and produce consistent cash flow. 
I'm optimistic and confident about HP's potential over the next several years. Don't get me wrong. We have work to do and it will take time. But we have some of the best core franchises in technology, a solid earnings and cash flow base, customers who want to do more business with us, a world-class leadership team and people who are motivated to win. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

HP is well positioned and committed to delivering value for our customers and investors. HP has a broad portfolio of industry-leading technology and capabilities, and we must use these assets to achieve our financial goals and create shareholder value. For fiscal 2012, we will focus on the business fundamentals of operational excellence and financial discipline to make this happen. 
Let's review the Q4 results to set some context for our outlook. Non-GAAP revenue of $32.3 billion was down 3% as reported or 6% in constant currency year-on-year. Note that our non-GAAP revenue excludes net GAAP revenue associated with the wind-down of our webOS hardware business in Q4. 
By geography, non-GAAP revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 3% but declined 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue in the Americas decreased 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency versus the prior year period, and non-GAAP revenue in EMEA was down 6% as reported and 10% in constant currency. 
Company-level non-GAAP gross margin of 23.2% was down 170 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially. Gross margins were impacted by the strong yen and a lower mix of printing supplies, as well as continued margin pressure in Services. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the increase in field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7% was down 230 basis points year-over-year with $3.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
The bridge from operating profit to our earnings per share includes the following. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $125 million. Our tax rate remained at 22%. Additionally, we repurchased 17 million shares in the quarter for $500 million. Share count, as a result declined, 13% year-over-year to 2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 12% to $1.17, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.12. 
There were several adjustments to earnings in Q4 that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. First, we took a total charge to operating income of $788 million. This was associated with the wind-down of our webOS device business. This charge included a net revenue reduction of $142 million related to the sales incentive program, $548 million in cost of sales due to supplier-related obligations and inventory reserves and $98 million in operating expenses and restructuring charges. 
Second, as a result of our decision to wind down webOS devices, we have taken an impairment expense of $885 million against a carrying value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of Palm. 
Finally, the expense related to the British pound options we bought to limit our exchange rate risk in connection with the Autonomy acquisition was $276 million, a bit less than what we had guided in August. 
Now turning to our performance by business. The Personal Systems Group delivered a revenue of $10.1 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. The segment delivered 2% operating profit growth year-over-year with a 5.7% operating margin. Workstations continue to produce double-digit revenue growth, contributing to the 5% growth in Commercial client revenue year-over-year. Consumer client revenue was down 9% versus the year-ago quarter with notebooks seeing a bigger decline than desktops. Total units shipped were up 2% year-over-year, but with average selling price declines, we saw no growth in desktop revenue year-over-year and a 4% decline in notebook revenue. Both form factors continue to be affected by weakness in consumer demand. 
Turning to Imaging and Printing. We delivered net revenue of $6.3 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to channel inventory reductions, broad-based weakness in EMEA and softening consumer demand, particularly for supplies. In Q4, operating profit for IPG totaled $808 million, or 12.8% of revenue, down 460 basis points year-over-year. Margins were unfavorably affected by the strong yen and lower-than-normal supplies mix of 54% as we continue to work down the high supplies channel inventory we discussed last quarter. 
Commercial printer revenue was up 4% year-over-year with commercial hardware units up 5%. Consumer printer revenue was down 8% year-over-year with an 8% decline in units. In total, printer unit shipments were down 5% year-over-year. 
Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 20% year-over-year. And we shipped more than 9 million web-connected printers this quarter, beating our target of 20 million web-connected printers by the end of fiscal 2011. 
Supplies revenue declined 14% year-over-year to $4 billion in the quarter. Remember, we entered Q4 with higher channel inventory than we would have liked, and we worked to reduce this throughout the quarter. As we said last quarter, supplies revenue closely follows economic cycles. [Indiscernible] continue to be impacted by softness in consumer demand as a result of continued pressure on unemployment globally and was below our expectations in the quarter. We ended the quarter with higher channel inventory than we would have liked in some regions. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.3 billion, up 2% from the prior year quarter but down 1% in constant currency. Operating profit of $1.2 billion, or 12.8% of revenue, was down 360 basis points from the prior year. Our Services turnaround will take time as we work to shift the business mix towards higher-growth, higher-margin services. 
IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Application Services revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 2% year-over-year, and Technology Services revenue grew 3% with double-digit growth in TS consulting services. 
Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. Across ESSN, we are seeing the effects of a slower economic environment. Operating profit of $733 million was down 17% year-over-year, and the operating margin of 13% was 210 basis points below the prior year. Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue, competitive pricing pressure and incremental investments in sales and R&D. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing the macro slowdown impact Industry Standard Servers. Revenue in ISS declined 4% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 23% year-over-year primarily due to a decline in our Itanium-based servers. Our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's Itanium decision, and we are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. 
Our HP Storage portfolio showed revenue growth of 4% year-over-year with 11% growth in our external disk products and, once again, triple-digit growth in 3PAR. Year-over-year declines in our tape and EVA product lines partially offset this growth. 
HP networking grew 5% year-over-year, and enterprise switching and routing grew 7% from the prior year period. We feel good about our business model and customer value proposition, and we added 15 new logos in the quarter. We expect to continue to gain market share in switching and routing    
Turning to HP Software. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $976 million, up 28% compared with the prior year, including 33% license growth, 36% services revenue growth and 20% support revenue growth. Our security offering continues to do well, and the IT Performance Suite offers enterprises a comprehensive solution for managing their infrastructure and applications. 
Overall, fourth quarter operating profit for HP Software was $270 million or 28% of revenue. We closed the acquisition of Autonomy in October, and, therefore, we had roughly one month of results in the Software numbers. The integration is going well thus far, and we are focused on enabling our global sales force to ramp on the Autonomy product lineup so they can begin selling Autonomy software in fiscal '12. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $952 million. Financing volume increased 12%, and net portfolio assets increased 12%. Operating profit of $98 million is up 34% year-over-year to 10.3% of revenue. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended fiscal '11 with total gross cash of $8.1 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 5 days from the prior year, primarily due to a 4-day increase in inventory days. Day sales outstanding increased one day from the prior year, and days payable were flat year-over-year. Panel inventories are a bit higher than we would like in some regions but within acceptable ranges at the company level. 
HP generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and $239 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $10.8 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Today, we are providing our outlook for both the first fiscal quarter and the full year 2012. We will continue to be transparent about the tailwinds and headwinds that our respective businesses are facing. We will no longer be providing quantitative revenue or segment-level outlooks. 
We will be managing the business towards earnings performance rather than particular revenue growth objectives, and we will continue to provide earnings per share outlook, consistent with how we are managing HP's performance as one company. 
Here are some color on our assumptions relating to revenue and earnings for the coming year. Based on what we saw in Q4, the macro environment remains uncertain globally and particularly in Europe. Consumer spending remains soft, and we have begun to see a slowdown in commercial spending. We expect these dynamics will lead to below-normal sequential revenue performance in Q1 and year-over-year revenue declines through 2012. 
From a business perspective, we expect the decline in our Business Critical Systems business will remain a headwind throughout the year. Additionally, during the first half of the year, we expect to experience headwinds associated with the flooding in Thailand affecting hard disk drive supply, primarily within PSG but also across ESSN. We also expect a slow correction in our IPG channel inventory level. 
Moving on to margins. In fiscal 2012, we will continue to be focused on profitable revenue, but we expect our margins will be impacted by several factors. First, the overall decline in revenue will impact margins at the company level. Second, we are seeing a competitive pricing environment across our transactional businesses. Third, we expect an impact due to the lower mix of Business Critical Systems. At the same time, we are investing in our services turnaround, which is driving an increase in costs due to delivery and sales personnel in that business. And we will continue to invest in innovation and in systems and processes needed to improve performance across all of our businesses over time. 
We will have increased other interest and expense due to the change in our capital structure with more debt. We expect OI&E to be an expense of roughly $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year. And finally, we expect our tax rate to remain at 22% for the full year. 
With that as context, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.86. We expect first quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.61 and $0.64. For the full year fiscal '12, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4, and we expect full year GAAP EPS to be at least $3.20. 
In conclusion, HP is making strategic investments in our people and our processes this year to enhance the core strengths of HP and to build upon our leadership positions across hardware, software, services and solutions. Meg and I will watch these expenditures closely against expected returns, making adjustments as required. 
In the end, we expect to be a stronger, more consistent performer, creating value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean, we have taken a prudent approach, Bill, to 2012 and Q1 guidance by modeling the year-over-year declines throughout the year. And I think it really falls into 3 buckets for me. First is that 1/3 is macroeconomic forces. We're seeing headwinds in all 3 regions, particularly in Europe. And we are also aggressively working through the Thailand situation, which will, I think, affect us in Q1 and Q2. The third bucket of things that we're looking at is HP-specific issues. And this is where we are making some investments, and we've got business challenges that actually need to be sorted out. So first of all, we are driving more organic innovation with R&D, the R&D investment in virtually every business we are taking up this year after an increase last year, but it is absolutely required. If we're going to get out of the M&A business, a big M&A, we've got to actually invest in R&D. We also have a services turnaround on our hands. And while that isn't R&D investment per se, that is investment in sales, and it is investment in people who can actually deliver the products that we want to deliver in Services. And then the last area is sales force. We did invest in sales force last year. We've made -- we've trimmed some of that expense, but we're making another investment this year in coverage, in big accounts where I think there is a lot more revenue for HP. So those would be the 3 major areas of investments that we're going to make in 2012. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?"
108856,117489372,195186,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2011",2011-11-21,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Yes, let me add a couple more points.

The other thing, Bill, you should take into consideration in your modeling is the fact that we will continue to see a decline in our Business Critical Systems business. It's going to be continue to be a headwind for our Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking margins. The strength of the yen. So at the end -- in Q4, the yen was up again quarter-on-quarter -- so the year-on-year strength in the yen, and that's going to continue to be a headwind for our IPG business. And then the other spot I would call out is that there are 2 impacts that are predominantly first half. So we would put the channel inventory corrections for the IPG supplies. We believe by the end of Q2 we will have gotten the level in the channel kind of roughly in line with what we think the demand is. So that's a first half event. And then the other first half, we think that the impact from the Thailand flooding on the hard disk drive availability starts to be alleviated by the end of the first half as well. So we've got those 2 impacts that help us in the second half as we work through them. And then maybe the only other thing, just to remind folks, because I did say in my prepared remarks that the -- we will have an OI&E expense that we believe will be between $1 billion and $1.3 billion this year, that is an increase over this year -- I'm sorry, over 2011 as a result of the capital structure changes that we made as we exited Q4 and the fact that interest rate differentials have gone against us, so the cost of our hedging program has gone up fairly significantly."

And so that our business unit heads are focused on business mix. Where can they find the most profitable parts of the mix that they can sell as opposed to just drive for revenue? Now, I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this company has always been focused on profitability, but I think the better measure of our success as a management team is going to be on EPS growth and revenue growth -- sorry, EPS growth and cash flow. So that's the reason that we're doing that. I want to make sure that everyone knows, obviously, we're going to report revenue by segment, we're going to have the same transparency in reporting that we always have, but it's going to give us some degrees of freedom, I think, to improve the management of this company by just guiding to EPS."

I completely believe that this is not a secular trend decline in Printing, that there is more information, more things to be printed, more people who love the capacity of print than ever before. In my view, and I've only been here 8 weeks, this was all about correcting a higher-than-normal supplies in the channel that what got put into the channel in Q1 and Q2, I think, the slowdown in Q3 and Q4 was a surprise to us, particularly on the commercial side but also on the consumer side. And what we know from years in this business is that supplies are almost a perfect predictor of economic health of almost any region. And so I think what you're seeing is consumers and small businesses in particular are worried about the economic environment and they are not buying as much printing supplies. But I do not think that this is a secular trend. Obviously, we are making an investment in things like graphics, in ePrint, in a whole host of things that are designed to actually increase the amount of printing.

And I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they are going to be back up and running. But I'll tell you some of the things we did. First of all, we reacted really fast to this. We set up a war room. We began pulling inventory and made strategic buys of hard drives back in early October. And so I think we will get more than our fair share of drives here because of the long-term relationships that we have with our suppliers because we were on this really fast. But I think this is going to affect the industry pretty dramatically because it's PCs, it's servers, it's storage. And I think there's going to be some shortages in Q1 and Q2.

My observation is that you are placing more emphasis on the tough macroeconomic environment than other companies have through this earnings period. Many have seen that -- many have said that they remained somewhat cautious but they really haven't felt its impact, whereas you seem to be saying it very definitively. And I want to explore that a little bit in why you are confident that some of the business erosion is macroeconomic driven rather than competitive driven. And my observations are that most companies are coming in slightly below normal seasonality for this quarter. You came in dramatically below normal seasonality. ISS grew at minus 4%, IBM was up plus 1%, Dell was up plus 12%, looks like you lost share. PC's market grew at 3% to 4%, you grew at 2% in units. IPG grew more than 10 points slower than Lexmark. Just some simple benchmarking would actually suggest that you're losing share. And so the question is why do you believe that this is predominantly macro? Do you believe that you're as competitive as you ought to be? Or is there some brand damage that was created earlier this year because of results and/or your PC decision that may be impacting your turn results in a more dramatic way?"

So I would say, if you look at 2011, there were 3 buckets of problems for HP, and I would say the weaker performance than we would have liked in 2007 is allocatable about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. 1/3 is macroeconomic trend and we saw pretty significant -- the Consumer was weak all year for us and the Commercial segment weakened in Q3 and Q4, and so no denying that. I mean, I think we absolutely saw that. I would say 1/3 of our challenges in 2011 were HP-specific, absolutely, whether it was the channel in IPG, whether it was China in PSG. We were hurt disproportionately in China from the NVIDIA recall, the Intel recall and then no question, our mid-August announcement hurt us in China more than any other market. And frankly, I think there was some brand damage to that. At least, it created uncertainty. I mean, I had customers tell us that they thought we are getting out of the hardware business entirely. So no question, we did ourselves in there. I would say on Services, the lack of the right tools and the mix of that business, we didn't perform as well as the industry in that business in 2011. On the other hand, we had a great year in Software and a great year in Financial Services. But the other third was what I would call the distraction factor. I mean, we just need to get back to putting our heads down and get out of the news cycle and reduce the drama here. There was a lot of drama in 2011. And so I'd say looking backwards, I'd say it's 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. Going forward, listen, we still got some macroeconomic headwinds. Maybe, we're calling it out more than others but we see it, and I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen in Europe. And even our EPS guidance does not take into account a complete meltdown in Europe. And then we've got some business issues we've got to work through that I think Cathie and I have covered, and hopefully, the distraction will be out of it. But I don't want to paint the picture that everything is perfect within HP. We've got work to do in each and every one of our businesses."

We do believe that it's a close call in terms of share from an industry standard server perspective, but you've probably noticed that there's a lot of volatility in share these days in industry standard servers because you've got these big service provider deals. And if you happen to win that quarter's deal, you're going to show a lot of share gain and other people aren't and then you're going to have tough compares, so I think you've got to take that into consideration as well.

And I think it's more appropriate to think about the Services as more as a turnaround. So turnaround is measured, success is measured in years as opposed to quarters. I think that's the best way to think about it. So talk about some of the headwinds that we've got to Services margins. We know that we've got to improve our mix of higher margin, higher growth business services such as applications. And that's going to take time. And at the same time that we're doing that, we've got to carefully review everything in our portfolio to make sure that we're focused on the right services, and so that could mean deemphasizing some of the lower margin services as well. We are absolutely investing in the right tools to effectively and efficiently run this business. This is a very big business, and to date guys, we put manual processes in place in order to manage this business. This is not the way to do it. So in '11, we made some investments. In '12, we are accelerating those investments and tools for this business. We are, as we've talked before, we're investing in sales and we're adding significantly to the delivery resources because at the end of the day, happier customers are going to buy more product at higher -- at better margins. And we also -- you also have to factor in the fact that you've got these ITO deals. These large ITO deals that over many years, they come on at lower margins and they run off at higher margins just because of the life cycle of an ITO deal, and we've got a bit of that going on as well. In the Technology Services space, you've got the headwind from business-critical servers revenue. Over time, it's going to hit us. It doesn't hit all at once. It's got a very long tail on it. I think it's important for you guys to understand this so you can think about how you model Services, but the fundamental that you got to take away from this is that we're making the right investments to create a good service business despite the fact that there will be continued pressures on the margins in 2012."

I'm excited about that acquisition. We can talk more about it. So there may be 2 or 3 acquisitions that we want to take a look at in the Software space, and now I know I'm going to be held to. If it's less than $500 million, we want to [ph]. Let me reframe that. If there is a great acquisition that's in the $1 billion range, maybe we will take a look at it. But we've got to be sure it fills a hole, that we don't pay too much for it and that we are financially disciplined about it. So that's a caveat I'll give to you. Listen, I have a history of, to some degree, using acquisitions to grow companies. I'm in favor of acquisitions, but I will tell you we cannot continue to rely on acquisitions alone at Hewlett-Packard. It's just the wrong thing to do. We have tremendous R&D capability here. And that's how you really do be, what I would call, required evolutionary innovation. For the completely disruptive revolutionary innovation, certainly, we can look outside but we got a lot of runway with our own internal R&D capability if we run it right and invest in it right."

I am really excited about this acquisition. And as you all know, I think it really positions HP as a leader in the next-generation information management and analytics capabilities as the explosion of data is making these capabilities absolutely critical. And Autonomy is a unique asset. It has a remarkable ability to manage unstructured information in a way that no one else in the market does, and I think that adds a lot of value not only in their space but actually across HP. So what we've set up is Autonomy is actually running fairly autonomously. But we have done a great job, I think, of integrating the go-to-market. So there are sales leads that are going from Autonomy to HP, interestingly, which we didn't expect so much of in terms of hardware pull-through, but also from our HP sales team back to Autonomy. And we've got a clearinghouse that gets [ph] all those leads so that what we turn over to Autonomy are really high-quality leads that will allow Autonomy to grow much faster than they would have grown on their own. And that's the name of the game for 2012. There's going to be lots of other things we do together but accelerating the growth of Autonomy, using the distribution capability of HP is priority #1, 2 and 3 for 2012 and we're really excited about it. And I also have to tell you, we're really excited about the team. Great set of folks who are passionate about what they do and I think are excited to be at HP."

In a couple of months since becoming HP's CEO, I've spent time with our people, our leadership team, our customers and our investors. I've seen and heard a lot of great things. We have unmatched strengths to build on: #1 or #2 positions in nearly all of our businesses; customers who want us to win; c intellectual property; global scale and reach that are unmatched; and employees who are smart, committed and resilient. But I also know we didn't live up to our expectations in 2011. We need to get back to doing what we do really well, being the reliable, trusted partner with whom our customers want to work and delivering the reliable, consistent results that all of you can count on. 
When I took this role, the team established 3 short-term priorities: deliver on the Q4 outlook; accelerate the decision on PSG and get Autonomy off to a good start within HP. So let me give you a quick update. First, we delivered Q4, and Cathie will give you more color on that in a few minutes. Second, we completed our analysis on PSG, and the response from all corners has been overwhelmingly positive. There's no question in our minds HP and PSG are better together. Third, we closed the Autonomy acquisition on October 3. In the last month, we've had hundreds of leads passed between the 2 companies, and we've created a new information management business group that combines Autonomy, Vertica and other HP software assets under Mike Lynch and reports directly to me. 
So we're off to a solid start. But I also know that it's going to be important to provide as much clarity as possible about our future, because over the course of last year and certainly on our last earnings call in August, we confused customers, employees, shareholders and partners on one fundamental issue around HP's strategy. 
As I travel, the one question I keep getting is, ""What is HP?"" Well, here's the first part of that answer. HP is the largest provider of information technology infrastructure, software, services and solutions to individuals and organizations of all sizes. We have incredible scale and breadth, and that's a powerful advantage that we know how to make the most of. We're a leader in PCs, printers, servers, storage, networking, services and information, automation and management software. 
HP has a great platform from which to build. And to be clear, we're in the software business to deliver value for our customers, not to transform HP into a software company. We bring the breadth and depth of our portfolio to meet customers' toughest problems, and we will continue to invest in our solutions through both internal innovation and M&A. 
We increased our R&D spend in FY '11 by nearly 10%. We launched some outstanding new products and drove innovation into the marketplace. In fact, just 3 weeks ago, we became the first large server vendor to announce new, extreme low-energy server technology code-named Moonshot. This is a revolutionary architecture that uses 89% less energy, 94% less space and 63% less cost. That is meaningful and exciting innovation. And in 2012, we plan to do more of the same and to increase our R&D investment once again. 
We've also seen good traction with our recent acquisitions. 3PAR, 3Com, Fortify and ArcSight. All are experiencing strong, double-digit or better growth and are taking advantage of HP's global distribution. 
Our software business has now posted several strong quarters in a row, demonstrating our success at integrating these new companies. Our IT Performance Suite and security platform are unique and winning in the industry. And I'm also excited about the future of Autonomy as part of HP. 
HP has all the components of an outstanding company, but we're not taking full advantage and leveraging these parts to drive the result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We need to be simpler, clearer and more consistent. No more surprises. We need to articulate a clear direction, from business strategy to financial strategy to capital allocation strategy. 
While I won't be communicating all the answers today, the executive team is hard at work on this. One thing we do know is that we're getting back to the basics of executing business fundamentals, which, frankly, we struggled with in FY '11. 
So what made FY '11 such a challenging year? And what are we doing differently in 2012? Let's start with the full 2011 results. We grew revenue 1%, non-GAAP EPS 7% and free cash flow 8%. And we generated $12.6 billion of cash flow from operations. While this was not HP's best annual performance, generating nearly $13 billion of cash flow is a good, healthy result. 
We faced some challenges that increased throughout the year and will continue into FY '12. Some were in HP's control, and others were not. Some will take time to resolve, others are more short term in nature. 
First, we increased our investment levels through fiscal year '11 because there are areas where HP had previously underinvested. This is a big reason why our Services margins have been coming down and remain pressured. And we also increased OpEx to drive more innovation and a bigger, better sales force. These are the right things to do for HP's future. And looking forward, we'll continue to invest organically. This includes investments in our people, intellectual property and services capabilities. We'll also increase our investments in IT systems and in processes to enhance our scale advantages. We'll be selective about the areas where we invest, and we'll monitor our performance and make adjustments as needed. 
Second, HP is a company known for its execution, but we did not execute consistently in FY '11. I'm a big believer in prioritization. Pick the things you need to accomplish, knock them down, pick up the next ones. We're doing this in each of our businesses, and I'm confident that we will restore the execution consistency that we all expect. 
Third, we faced unplanned challenges outside our immediate control, many of which still remain. The macroeconomic picture became increasingly uncertain through FY '11, and we're remaining cautious about 2012. Our consumer business was down throughout 2011, and the commercial business slowed down as the year went on. Using Q4 as a baseline, consumer was down 9%, and commercial was down 2% year-over-year. 
We also confronted onetime issues like the natural disaster in Japan, and now we're facing the flooding in Thailand. We'll do our best to mitigate these external impacts, but prudent expectations are appropriate. 
Finally, HP went through a large number of distractions last year that affected performance. We had a CEO change, strategic shifts and many new cycles. We also deployed significant capital in 2011 through share repurchases, acquisitions and an increase in dividends. Through this, we created confusion with many of our shareholders about what kind of company HP is. 
As we move ahead, I'm very focused on being clear with all of you about who we are and on continuing to drive strong financial discipline. Our strategic decisions will have solid financial underpinnings, just like our PSG decision did. Each of our businesses will use their respective levers to drive profitable growth. But we'll manage HP as one company. And ultimately, we'll measure ourselves by the company's earnings per share. As a result, we're modifying our guidance approach to focus only on EPS at a company level. 
To summarize, HP is getting back to business fundamentals in 2012. We'll make smart investments, fix our execution challenges, plan prudently and drive strong financial discipline. Our near-term focus is on driving execution and investing for the future. But frankly, many of the FY '11 headwinds are still with us. We're expecting declines in both revenue and profits in FY '12, but we'll be doing the hard work that will position us for consistent, profitable growth in 2013 and beyond. 
HP will continue to be a strong generator of cash, and I know many of you want more clarity on our capital allocation plan. I can tell you that we'll be pursuing a disciplined and balanced approach. You should assume in 2012 that HP will be rebuilding its balance sheet and will not be doing any large M&A. Additionally, you should expect that share repurchases and dividends will continue to be a core part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. Over the long term, we expect HP to be a GDP-type growth company that can grow revenue in line or better than our markets, grow earnings faster than revenue and produce consistent cash flow. 
I'm optimistic and confident about HP's potential over the next several years. Don't get me wrong. We have work to do and it will take time. But we have some of the best core franchises in technology, a solid earnings and cash flow base, customers who want to do more business with us, a world-class leadership team and people who are motivated to win. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

HP is well positioned and committed to delivering value for our customers and investors. HP has a broad portfolio of industry-leading technology and capabilities, and we must use these assets to achieve our financial goals and create shareholder value. For fiscal 2012, we will focus on the business fundamentals of operational excellence and financial discipline to make this happen. 
Let's review the Q4 results to set some context for our outlook. Non-GAAP revenue of $32.3 billion was down 3% as reported or 6% in constant currency year-on-year. Note that our non-GAAP revenue excludes net GAAP revenue associated with the wind-down of our webOS hardware business in Q4. 
By geography, non-GAAP revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 3% but declined 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue in the Americas decreased 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency versus the prior year period, and non-GAAP revenue in EMEA was down 6% as reported and 10% in constant currency. 
Company-level non-GAAP gross margin of 23.2% was down 170 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially. Gross margins were impacted by the strong yen and a lower mix of printing supplies, as well as continued margin pressure in Services. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the increase in field selling costs. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7% was down 230 basis points year-over-year with $3.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
The bridge from operating profit to our earnings per share includes the following. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $125 million. Our tax rate remained at 22%. Additionally, we repurchased 17 million shares in the quarter for $500 million. Share count, as a result declined, 13% year-over-year to 2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 12% to $1.17, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.12. 
There were several adjustments to earnings in Q4 that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. First, we took a total charge to operating income of $788 million. This was associated with the wind-down of our webOS device business. This charge included a net revenue reduction of $142 million related to the sales incentive program, $548 million in cost of sales due to supplier-related obligations and inventory reserves and $98 million in operating expenses and restructuring charges. 
Second, as a result of our decision to wind down webOS devices, we have taken an impairment expense of $885 million against a carrying value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of Palm. 
Finally, the expense related to the British pound options we bought to limit our exchange rate risk in connection with the Autonomy acquisition was $276 million, a bit less than what we had guided in August. 
Now turning to our performance by business. The Personal Systems Group delivered a revenue of $10.1 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. The segment delivered 2% operating profit growth year-over-year with a 5.7% operating margin. Workstations continued to produce double-digit revenue growth, contributing to the 5% growth in Commercial client revenue year-over-year. Consumer client revenue was down 9% versus the year-ago quarter with notebooks seeing a bigger decline than desktops. Total units shipped were up 2% year-over-year, but with average selling price declines, we saw no growth in desktop revenue year-over-year and a 4% decline in notebook revenue. Both form factors continue to be affected by weakness in consumer demand. 
Turning to Imaging and Printing. We delivered net revenue of $6.3 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to channel inventory reductions, broad-based weakness in EMEA and softening consumer demand, particularly for supplies. In Q4, operating profit for IPG totaled $808 million, or 12.8% of revenue, down 460 basis points year-over-year. Margins were unfavorably affected by the strong yen and lower-than-normal supplies mix of 54% as we continued to work down the high supplies channel inventory we discussed last quarter. 
Commercial printer revenue was up 4% year-over-year with commercial hardware units up 5%. Consumer printer revenue was down 8% year-over-year with an 8% decline in units. In total, printer unit shipments were down 5% year-over-year. 
Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 20% year-over-year. And we shipped more than 9 million web-connected printers this quarter, beating our target of 20 million web-connected printers by the end of fiscal 2011. 
Supplies revenue declined 14% year-over-year to $4 billion in the quarter. Remember, we entered Q4 with higher channel inventory than we would have liked, and we worked to reduce this throughout the quarter. As we said last quarter, supplies revenue closely follows economic cycles. [Indiscernible] continue to be impacted by softness in consumer demand as a result of continued pressure on unemployment globally and was below our expectations in the quarter. We ended the quarter with higher channel inventory than we would have liked in some regions. 
HP Services delivered revenue of $9.3 billion, up 2% from the prior year quarter but down 1% in constant currency. Operating profit of $1.2 billion, or 12.8% of revenue, was down 360 basis points from the prior year. Our Services turnaround will take time as we work to shift the business mix towards higher-growth, higher-margin services. 
IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.9 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Application Services revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 2% year-over-year, and Technology Services revenue grew 3% with double-digit growth in TS consulting services. 
Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. Across ESSN, we are seeing the effects of a slower economic environment. Operating profit of $733 million was down 17% year-over-year, and the operating margin of 13% was 210 basis points below the prior year. Operating margins were impacted by a lower mix of BCS revenue, competitive pricing pressure and incremental investments in sales and R&D. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing the macro slowdown impact Industry Standard Servers. Revenue in ISS declined 4% year-over-year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems declined 23% year-over-year primarily due to a decline in our Itanium-based servers. Our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's Itanium decision, and we are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. 
Our HP Storage portfolio showed revenue growth of 4% year-over-year with 11% growth in our external disk products and, once again, triple-digit growth in 3PAR. Year-over-year declines in our tape and EVA product lines partially offset this growth. 
HP networking grew 5% year-over-year, and enterprise switching and routing grew 7% from the prior year period. We feel good about our business model and customer value proposition, and we added 15 new logos in the quarter. We expect to continue to gain market share in switching and routing    
Turning to HP Software. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $976 million, up 28% compared with the prior year, including 33% license growth, 36% services revenue growth and 20% support revenue growth. Our security offering continues to do well, and the IT Performance Suite offers enterprises a comprehensive solution for managing their infrastructure and applications. 
Overall, fourth quarter operating profit for HP Software was $270 million or 28% of revenue. We closed the acquisition of Autonomy in October, and, therefore, we had roughly one month of results in the Software numbers. The integration is going well thus far, and we are focused on enabling our global sales force to ramp on the Autonomy product lineup so they can begin selling Autonomy software in fiscal '12. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $952 million. Financing volume increased 12%, and net portfolio assets increased 12%. Operating profit of $98 million is up 34% year-over-year to 10.3% of revenue. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended fiscal '11 with total gross cash of $8.1 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 26 days, up 5 days from the prior year, primarily due to a 4-day increase in inventory days. Day sales outstanding increased one day from the prior year, and days payable were flat year-over-year. Panel inventories are a bit higher than we would like in some regions but within acceptable ranges at the company level. 
HP generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and $239 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $10.8 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Today, we are providing our outlook for both the first fiscal quarter and the full year 2012. We will continue to be transparent about the tailwinds and headwinds that our respective businesses are facing. We will no longer be providing quantitative revenue or segment-level outlooks. 
We will be managing the business towards earnings performance rather than particular revenue growth objectives, and we will continue to provide earnings per share outlook, consistent with how we are managing HP's performance as one company. 
Here are some color on our assumptions relating to revenue and earnings for the coming year. Based on what we saw in Q4, the macro environment remains uncertain globally and particularly in Europe. Consumer spending remains soft, and we have begun to see a slowdown in commercial spending. We expect these dynamics will lead to below-normal sequential revenue performance in Q1 and year-over-year revenue declines through 2012. 
From a business perspective, we expect the decline in our Business Critical Systems business will remain a headwind throughout the year. Additionally, during the first half of the year, we expect to experience headwinds associated with the flooding in Thailand affecting hard disk drive supply, primarily within PSG but also across ESSN. We also expect a slow correction in our IPG channel inventory levels. 
Moving on to margins. In fiscal 2012, we will continue to be focused on profitable revenue, but we expect our margins will be impacted by several factors. First, the overall decline in revenue will impact margins at the company level. Second, we are seeing a competitive pricing environment across our transactional businesses. Third, we expect an impact due to the lower mix of Business Critical Systems. At the same time, we are investing in our services turnaround, which is driving an increase in costs due to delivery and sales personnel in that business. And we will continue to invest in innovation and in systems and processes needed to improve performance across all of our businesses over time. 
We will have increased other interest and expense due to the change in our capital structure with more debt. We expect OI&E to be an expense of roughly $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year. And finally, we expect our tax rate to remain at 22% for the full year. 
With that as context, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.86. We expect first quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.61 and $0.64. For the full year fiscal '12, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4, and we expect full year GAAP EPS to be at least $3.20. 
In conclusion, HP is making strategic investments in our people and our processes this year to enhance the core strengths of HP and to build upon our leadership positions across hardware, software, services and solutions. Meg and I will watch these expenditures closely against expected returns, making adjustments as required. 
In the end, we expect to be a stronger, more consistent performer, creating value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean, we have taken a prudent approach, Bill, to 2012 and Q1 guidance by modeling the year-over-year declines throughout the year. And I think it really falls into 3 buckets for me. First is that 1/3 is macroeconomic forces. We're seeing headwinds in all 3 regions, particularly in Europe. And we are also aggressively working through the Thailand situation, which will, I think, affect us in Q1 and Q2. The third bucket of things that we're looking at is HP-specific issues. And this is where we are making some investments, and we've got business challenges that actually need to be sorted out. So first of all, we are driving more organic innovation with R&D, the R&D investment in virtually every business we are taking up this year after an increase last year, but it is absolutely required. If we're going to get out of the M&A business, a big M&A, we've got to actually invest in R&D. We also have a services turnaround on our hands. And while that isn't R&D investment per se, that is investment in sales, and it is investment in people who can actually deliver the products that we want to deliver in Services. And then the last area is sales force. We did invest in sales force last year. We've made -- we've trimmed some of that expense, but we're making another investment this year in coverage, in big accounts where I think there is a lot more revenue for HP. So those would be the 3 major areas of investments that we're going to make in 2012. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?"

The other thing, Bill, you should take into consideration in your modeling is the fact that we will continue to see a decline in our Business Critical Systems business. It's going to be continue to be a headwind for our Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking margins. The strength of the yen. So at the end -- in Q4, the yen was up again quarter-on-quarter -- so the year-on-year strength in the yen, and that's going to continue to be a headwind for our IPG business. And then the other spot I would call out is that there are 2 impacts that are predominantly first half. So we would put the channel inventory corrections for the IPG supplies. We believe by the end of Q2 we will have gotten the level in the channel kind of roughly in line with what we think the demand is. So that's a first half event. And then the other first half, we think that the impact from the Thailand flooding on the hard disk drive availability starts to be alleviated by the end of the first half as well. So we've got those 2 impacts that help us in the second half as we work through them. And then maybe the only other thing, just to remind folks, because I did say in my prepared remarks that the -- we will have an OI&E expense that we believe will be between $1 billion and $1.3 billion this year, that is an increase over this year -- I'm sorry, over 2011 as a result of the capital structure changes that we made as we exited Q4 and the fact that interest rate differentials have gone against us, so the cost of our hedging program has gone up fairly significantly."

And so that our business unit heads are focused on business mix. Where can they find the most profitable parts of the mix that they can sell as opposed to just drive for revenue? Now, I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this company has always been focused on profitability, but I think the better measure of our success as a management team is going to be on EPS growth and revenue growth -- sorry, EPS growth and cash flow. So that's the reason that we're doing that. I want to make sure that everyone knows, obviously, we're going to report revenue by segment, we're going to have the same transparency in reporting that we always have, but it's going to give us some degrees of freedom, I think, to improve the management of this company by just guiding to EPS."

I completely believe that this is not a secular trend decline in Printing, that there is more information, more things to be printed, more people who have the capacity of print than ever before. In my view, and I've only been here 8 weeks, this was all about correcting a higher-than-normal supplies in the channel that what got put into the channel in Q1 and Q2, I think, the slowdown in Q3 and Q4 was a surprise to us, particularly on the commercial side but also on the consumer side. And what we know from years in this business is that supplies are almost a perfect predictor of economic health of almost any region. And so I think what you're seeing is consumers and small businesses in particular are worried about the economic environment and they are not buying as much printing supplies. But I do not think that this is a secular trend. Obviously, we are making an investment in things like graphics, in ePrint, in a whole host of things that are designed to actually increase the amount of printing.

We set up a war room. We began pulling in inventory and made strategic buys of hard drives back in early October. And so I think we will get more than our fair share of drives here because of the long-term relationships that we have with our suppliers because we were on this really fast.

And I want to explore that a little bit in why you are confident that some of the business erosion is macroeconomic driven rather than competitive driven. And my observations are that most companies are coming in slightly below normal seasonality for this quarter. You came in dramatically below normal seasonality. ISS grew at minus 4%, IBM was up plus 1%, Dell was up plus 12%, looks like you lost share. PC's market grew at 3% to 4%, you grew at 2% in units. IPG grew more than 10 points slower than Lexmark. Just some simple benchmarking would actually suggest that you're losing share. And so the question is why do you believe that this is predominantly macro?

I mean, I think we absolutely saw that. I would say 1/3 of our challenges in 2011 were HP-specific, absolutely, whether it was the channel in IPG, whether it was China in PSG. We were hurt disproportionately in China from the NVIDIA recall, the Intel recall and then no question, our mid-August announcement hurt us in China more than any other market. And frankly, I think there was some brand damage to that. At least, it created uncertainty. I mean, I had customers tell us that they thought we are getting out of the hardware business entirely. So no question, we did ourselves in there. I would say on Services, the lack of the right tools and the mix of that business, we didn't perform as well as the industry in that business in 2011. On the other hand, we had a great year in Software and a great year in Financial Services. But the other third was what I would call the distraction factor. I mean, we just need to get back to putting our heads down and get out of the news cycle and reduce the drama here. There was a lot of drama in 2011. And so I'd say looking backwards, I'd say its 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. Going forward, listen, we still got some macroeconomic headwinds. Maybe, we're calling it out more than others but we see it, and I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen in Europe. And even our EPS guidance does not take into account a complete meltdown in Europe. And then we've got some business issues we've got to work through that I think Cathie and I have covered, and hopefully, the distraction will be out of it.

We do believe that it's a close call in terms of share from an industry standard server perspective, but you've probably noticed that there's a lot of volatility in share these days in industry standard servers because you've got these big service provider deals. And if you happen to win that quarter's deal, you're going to show a lot of share gain and other people aren't and then you're going to have tough compares, so I think you've got to take that into consideration as well.

And I think it's more appropriate to think about the Services as more as a turnaround. So turnaround is measured -- success is measured in years as opposed to quarters. I think that's the best way to think about it. So talk about some of the headwinds that we've got to Services margins. We know that we've got to improve our mix of higher margin, higher growth business services such as applications. And that's going to take time. And at the same time that we're doing that, we've got to carefully review everything in our portfolio to make sure that we're focused on the right services, and so that could mean deemphasizing some of the lower margin services as well. We are absolutely investing in the right tools to effectively and efficiently run this business. This is a very big business, and to date guys, we put manual processes in place in order to manage this business. This is not the way to do it. So in '11, we made some investments. In '12, we are accelerating those investments and tools for this business. We are, as we've talked before, we're investing in sales and we're adding significantly to the delivery resources because at the end of the day, happier customers are going to buy more product at higher -- at better margins. And we also -- you also have to factor in the fact that you've got these ITO deals. These large ITO deals that over many years, they come on at lower margins and they run off at higher margins just because of the life cycle of an ITO deal, and we've got a bit of that going on as well. In the Technology Services space, you've got the headwind from business-critical servers revenue. Over time, it's going to hit us. It doesn't hit all at once. It's got a very long tail on it. I think it's important for you guys to understand this so you can think about how you model Services, but the fundamental that you got to take away from this is that we're making the right investments to create a good service business despite the fact that there will be continued pressures on the margins in 2012."

We just need to make them work harder together and we need to run this company as one HP so that we can bring the full portfolio to bear to solve customer problems.

I'm excited about that acquisition. We can talk more about it. So there may be 2 or 3 acquisitions that we want to take a look at in the Software space, and now I know I'm going to be held to. If it's less than $500 million, we want to do it. Let me reframe that. If there is a great acquisition that's in the $1 billion range, maybe we will take a look at it. But we've got to be sure it fills a hole, that we don't pay too much for it and that we are financially disciplined about it. So that's a caveat I'll give to you. Listen, I have a history of, to some degree, using acquisitions to grow companies. I'm in favor of acquisitions, but I will tell you we cannot continue to rely on acquisitions alone at Hewlett-Packard. It's just the wrong thing to do. We have tremendous R&D capability here.

It has a remarkable ability to manage unstructured information in a way that no one else in the market does, and I think that adds a lot of value not only in their space but actually across HP. So what we've set up is Autonomy is actually running fairly autonomously. But we have done a great job, I think, of integrating the go-to-market. So there are sales leads that are going from Autonomy to HP, interestingly, which we didn't expect so much of in terms of hardware pull-through, but also from our HP sales team back to Autonomy. And we've got a clearinghouse that vets all those leads so that what we turn over to Autonomy are really high-quality leads that will allow Autonomy to grow much faster than they would have grown on their own. And that's the name of the game for 2012. There's going to be lots of other things we do together but accelerating the growth of Autonomy, using the distribution capability of HP is priority #1, 2 and 3 for 2012 and we're really excited about it.
