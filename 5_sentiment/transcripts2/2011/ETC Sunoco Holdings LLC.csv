With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory,",850,"Thank you, and good evening, and welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will discuss the company's fourth quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position and Fritz will provide an update on our Sunoco.
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference, as we progress through our remarks. I'd also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide #2 of the Slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release.
Now let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3 and 4, we earned $13 million in net income, excluding special items or $0.11 per share. While I look at our performance in the fourth quarter, I see three things. First, the marketplace continue to be challenging, the weak demand and excess supply in our markets and the rising crude prices continue to put downward pressure on margins, especially in our retail business where it's more difficult to quickly pass through sharper higher raw material cost. 
On the refining and supply side, the northeast region experienced moderate improvement with higher market cracks, but rising crude prices also factored into refining's results. 
Second, we had additional work to do in the area of operational reliability, which negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units in our northeast refinery came down for unscheduled maintenance. Overall, our refining utilization for the quarter was 85%, well below our planned rate. Along with the crude margin capture, operational reliability remain our focus area for us this year. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. Sunoco Logistics Partners almost $400 million was invested for expansion capital during 2010. Additionally, we recently announced sale of the refinery to PBS which we expect to close in the first quarter, the purchase of 25 high-quality retail state in Upstate New York and a new long-term contracts to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway, starting in 2011 and the Ohio turnpike beginning in 2012. We also continue to be successful in growing our distributor network. 
These various actions are part of a plan that aims for Sunoco to become the premiere provider of transportation fuel in our markets. Despite many challenges in 2010, I'm pleased to say Sunoco made progress against our strategic goal. We finished the year with $1.5 billion in cash, which provides us with considerable strategic flexibility. We also took steps to achieve growth in our retail and logistics businesses and to improve the overall competitiveness of our refinery. 
The work done last year set the stage for continued progress in 2011. This will only happen if we run our business effectively and in such a way that it can continue to grow even in difficult markets. We cannot count on helping the marketplace. It's our view that conditions in 2011 will be similar to what we saw in 2010. 
Our strategy to use our brand to pull fuel through our system depends on a tightly integrated team that executes well in each step of the value chain. In retail, we need to grow and protect the strong Sunoco brand, the customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-on-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations who are providing a great customer experience at retail, we expect demand will pull product from our refineries and through the pipelines, terminals and branded retail network. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue to integrate recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities inside and outside the traditional Sunoco footprint. 
The recent acquisition of the butane-blending business and the reversal and conversion of accrued pipeline to product service are good examples of the range of growth opportunities we're willing to consider. Our refineries sit and sidelined with a larger transportation of fuel markets in the world. If we can operate them safely, reliably and efficiently, we can be competitive in the marketplace. 
Our refining and supply segment remains focused on the fundamentals, improve margin capture, lower our breakeven cost per barrel and operate reliably and safely. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing to operate independently remains a top priority. The recent acquisition of coal assets contiguous to our fuel operations increases our reserves, enable synergies with our existing mines and demonstrates how committed we are to preparing SunCoke for the next phase of growth as an independent entity. 
Fritz will talk about our preparations in more detail shortly, but I am pleased that we have reached a resettlement with Metal that resolved the lawsuit concerning coke pricing at the Jewell facility and we now can move forward with a separation of the business to unlock shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of",2452,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of net of favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the liquidation of crude oil and refined product inventories, a provision for asset write-downs attributable to the Eagle Point refinery and pension settlement losses and accruals for employee terminations and related cost in connection with the ongoing business improvement initiatives. 
We also recognize net benefit from taxes related to recurring Coke business tax credits, biofuels tax credits granted at year-end and other adjustments to recurring taxes, which occur the changes in estimates. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our logistics business and achieved our 2010 full year guidance for the Coke business. Market conditions were challenging in our retail and Refining and Supply business this quarter and operational issues in our refining facilities prevented us from taking advantage of the moderate sequential improvement that did occur in the northeast market. 
As you can see in Slide 4, refining and supply recorded a pretax loss of $17 million. While we are not satisfied in posting a loss in our refining and supply business, and we are working on the issues around operational reliability, we also can take a step back and recognize our year-over-year improvement in the business. We feel confident that the significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken, including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, refocusing our market strategy and last but not least, our initiatives around cost structure. 
Our focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Full year 2010 cash operating expenses, excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations, were approximately $185 million lower than 2009. Excluding the Coke business where we are adding costs as we grow and prepare for our separation, the improvement versus the prior year is approximately $240 million. This expense measurement basis of cash operating expenses ex fuel and utilities has been used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses was also part of our 2010 companywide bonus targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our cost to a competitive level. 
A year ago, we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery. At that time, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business even within a tough market environment similar to the one we were experiencing at that time. As a result of the actions we have taken for the full year 2010 as you can see on Slide 5, we generated positive EBIT that was in excess of our capital requirements for 2010 in the Refining and Supply business. This represents a tremendous improvement versus 2009 when the business experienced significant cash burn.
So while we continue to be pleased with our progress on many of our controllable aspects of our operations, we will continue to maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets and can make the most of the market opportunities that do present themselves. 
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 9. First, let's discuss the retail logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe had the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing logistics and Coke businesses earned $63 million pretax, $47 million after tax in the aggregate or in the quarter, as detailed on Slides 4 and 6. 
Retail Marketing earned $1 million pretax and $3 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins were significantly challenged, as crude prices and wholesale gasoline prices were on the rise throughout most of the quarter. 
While we experienced a challenging quarter, we earned $176 million pretax for the full year 2010, an improvement of $30 million versus the prior year. We do see volatility in this business quarter-to-quarter, but historical annual results proved that over time, this business delivers strong consistent results. We saw strong volume relative to the challenging quarter one year ago, gasoline and distillate volume is up by 1.8% and 7%, respectively on an open both year basis. Additionally, we made progress during the quarter in our retail growth strategy, including the acquisition of 25 sites in New York, newer extended agreements to extend precise on the Ohio turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Palisades Parkway and continued growth in the distributor network. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,900 sides carried the Sunoco flag and this is the business we continue to target for growth.
Turning now to logistics, which earned $37 million pretax, $23 million after tax in the fourth quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership interest in Sunoco Logistics, which continues to be a reliable source of earnings. The throughput and turning business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist, as was the case in the third quarter and to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter. 
The logistics business also had strong growth opportunities. Sunoco Logistics spent approximately $390 million in expansion capital during 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million excluding major acquisitions and project partners. Coker and $25 million pretax, $21 million after tax in Q4. The Coke business earned $132 million net income after tax for the full year, consistent with the earnings guidance previously provided. Relative to the third quarter, earnings were lower due to spot sales of coke in the third quarter and higher spending in the fourth quarter related to activities around growth and preparation to be a stand-alone business. Additionally, production issues at our Indiana Harbor plant and arbitration and legal cost impacted fourth quarter results. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted our expectation that we would be able to achieve breakeven cash flow in the Coke business. We are pleased to report that SunCoke generated EBITDA in excess of capital spending and also generated additional cash load to working capital in 2010. This is a significant accomplishment for the business, as it prepares to operate as a stand-alone business. 
Regarding the separation, now that the Jewell litigation is behind us, Sunoco intends to move forward with the planned separation of SunCoke in a two-step process. Later in the call, Fritz will address the settlement agreement regarding the Jewell plant. Our earned expedition for 2011 and '12 and provide an update on the growth outlook.
Now turning to Refining and Supply as shown on Slide 7. Refining and Supply at a loss of $17 million pretax or $8 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $227 million pretax or $135 million after tax in the same quarter in 2009. We saw market conditions in the northeast system improve in the fourth quarter, as reflected in the market margins, but we experience operational issues, which hindered our performance. 
Our systemwide crude unit utilization rate was 85% for the fourth quarter, which is obviously much lower than the optimal rates given the margin environment. The northeast system was impacted by operational issues and the Toledo refinery utilization was also negatively impacted by crude oil, pipeline allocation limits. 
In the northeast, both refineries experienced mechanical issues late in the quarter for, which maintenance work continues into the first quarter of 2011. We expect to complete the maintenance activities in February and return to normal rates in March. As a result of this work, first quarter utilization for the northeast systems is expected to be similar to the first quarter of 2010. With respect to our Q4 margin realizations, refer you to Slide 8 and 9 for more detail on our refining system crude comp and product differentials versus our benchmark. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our systemwide Refining and Supply benchmark averaged 611 per barrel for the fourth quarter and margin capture was 78%. While market margins and margin capture rates were both significantly improved from the same quarter of last year, our margin capture was challenged by both rising crude prices and our own operational difficulties. Exceeding crude timing, which negatively impacted the capture rate for the second consecutive quarter, margin capture was 86%. Our operational issues resulted in lack of rateability, which also had a negative impact on our margin  capture in the midst of the current also pricing environment. 
Even with the difficulties experienced in the fourth quarter, we showed significant improvement in margin capture for the full year of 2010 versus 2009. Our improvements can be attributed to better reliability and a successful strategy matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability and utilization is both in the northeast and Toledo, as we were undergoing turnaround activity in Toledo during 2009. Overall as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production, as a percent of total production. Specifically in 2010, 36% of our net production was distillate versus 32% in 2009, with the offset being less production of the cheaper residual fuels. Our actions that supported the improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slates and the operations of the new hydrotreater unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we seized opportunities to upgrade more the distillate to ULSD when it was attractive to do so. Northeast ULSD differentials to reading are widened by $0.1.5 a gallon year-over-year. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. We have noted that there can't be market factors, which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period. Additionally, we recognize that reliability of our refineries is an essential component to strong performance and the fourth quarter is a demonstration of this. We will remain focused on the fundamentals, those elements within our control to drive strong performance in whatever environment exists. 
As previously noted, our first quarter utilization is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter due to maintenance work in our northeast system. Accordingly, we expect challenged refining and supply results again in the first quarter, given the resulting lower utilization level, along with still rising crude prices and relatively weaker northeast market conditions evident thus far. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of December. In conjunction with that, I'll direct you to Slide 10 and 11. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics was a source of approximately $360 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $180 million, excluding SXL. This represents a swing of $1.4 billion from the prior year end when the Sunoco parent was carrying $1.2 billion of net debt. The cash increase in the quarter was driven by working capital movements, as we liquidated inventories related to our Eagle Point refinery, which was shut down in late 2009. We ended the quarter with a net debt to capital ratio of negative 6% at the Sunoco level, excluding SXL. 
At December 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. As seen on Slide 12, our capital spend for 2010, excluding Sunoco Logistics Partners, was $614 million, which included $223 million for Refining and Supply without the gross spending for the plan. We were successful in managing capital for this business and reduced our total spread by approximately $75 million versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. This reduction has been achieved, primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects, as well as some deferred projects, which had no impact on safe and reliable operations. We continue to focus on running safe and reliable operations, but we will also continue to limit the discretionary capital that is put into this business. 
As it relates to capital spending and expectations for Refining and Supply in 2011, we are currently in discussions with the appropriate government environmental authorities about the requirements of the 2006 consent decree as it applies to the markets of refinery. As we have previously reported, we have completed projects at the Philadelphia and Toledo refineries under a 2006 consent decree. We had expected to make additional capital outlays of approximately $200 million at the Marcus Hook focus refinery under the same consent decree by June 30, 2013. We are hopeful that in no time these recent discussions will include an extension of the required timeframe for these capital outlays, thus reducing our capital outlays in 2011 and 2012. This will allow us additional time to explore options that will lower the cost of the total project. If these discussions are successful and subject to the closing of the Toledo refinery sale, we expect 2011 capital spending and Refining and Supply business to range from $135 million to $145 million, down from 2010 and below DD&A. 
While we are closely managing our capital spend in the Refining and Supply business, we are targeting our Coke Logistics and Retail businesses for growth opportunities. Our 2011 capital guidance, as shown on Slide 12, includes approximately $165 million to finish the SunCoke Middletown plant, which is expected to be running late in the second half of 2011. We also showed logistics capital spend, including maintenance capital in the range of $145 million to $195 million, which is expected to be funded by Sunoco Logistics Partners and excludes any potential major acquisitions and project MARINER spend. 
Lastly, we've continued to pursue growth opportunities in our Retail business. These will be opportunistic and thus are not included in our capital guidance at this time.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the challenging and volatile refining environment. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At December 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.1 billion. Now I'll turn the call over to Fritz Henderson who will provide an update on the SunCoke business."
305749,118107646,99004,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by our concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 thi",998,"Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by our concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 this year 2011 and includes the following terms. First, the renegotiation of the Jewell coke contract, including the elimination of what was called the Jewell coal cut multiplier and the increase in the fees at Jewell. The pricing of Jewell coal will be based upon the third-party coal price at SunCoke's Haverhill facility. Second, a renegotiation and increase in the fees paid under the Haverhill agreement. Third, the Take-or-Pay basis of both Jewell and Haverhill agreements with our mail will be extended to 2020. This extension provides SunCoke a guarantee outlet for this coke production through 2028. Both of these contracts were previously structured to convert to the basis of our requirement effective 2012 so we extended the Take-or-Pay through 2020. 
Finally, in addition to resolving the Jewell litigation earlier this week, we also negotiated a settlement of arbitration claims related to our supply of coke from our Indiana Harbor site. Cost associated with the settlement was largely accrued in the fourth quarter. Combined with the Jewell settlement, we have now resolved all of our existing material and commercial disputes with along with a focus of building a productive dialogue in partnership with our largest customer, including possible extension of the Indiana Harbor contract that expires in 2013. The Indiana Harbor contract is to date the only contract that we have not covered by longer-term Take-or-Pay arrangements. We are pleased to put these matters behind us. We continue to move forward with our plans to separate the business and unlock shareholder value.
On the operating side of the business, reflecting both operating and capacity issues at our Indiana Harbor facility, we did not deliver to our contractual minimum to 2010. This is the only facility were we've missed our minimum since 2010. As the coke was not required, there were no shortfall penalties payable by SunCoke. 
With regard to 2011, while we are aggressively pursuing other reliability repairs and throughput initiatives, we do not expect to be able to restore volumes to the contractual minimum to the Indiana Harbor. And as such, we are working with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements in our own facilities. 
Let me take a moment to discuss earnings guidance, turning to Slide 14. In 2011, SunCoke Energy is expected to earn EBITDA in range of $165 million to $200 million, based upon our average contracted coal purchase price for 2011 of approximately $165 per ton. As compared to 2010 actual results, earnings of 2011 will be lower due to the rise of the terms of the Jewell coke contract and higher operating cost related to relocation of the business from Knoxville to Chicago and operation as a stand-alone company, partially offset by higher coke market prices and higher production related to a full year granted to the operations and the expected startup of our Middletown operations. 
In 2012, with a full year of Middletown operations and increased coal production from our expansion, we expect EBITDA to range from $280 million to $320 million. This assumes a coal price of approximately $175 per ton. Coal purchases have not yet been contracted for 2012. They wouldn't expect them to be contracted forward until late in 2011, but $175 these are well below where we see coal prices in the spot markets today. 
The net income guidance shown on the chart flows from the EBITDA levels, but does not include any interest expense associated with a yet to be determined capital structure for SunCoke.
As Slide 15 reflects, we continue to work towards preparing SunCoke for a successful operation as a standalone entity, including preparing for the relocation of our headquarters to Chicago and hiring key leadership. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we saw once again in the most recent steel downturn, long term Take-or-Pay agreements provided strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, where all of our customers respecting their commitments to this most recent period for example. Looking forward, beyond the stable base of our existing contracts, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities, in both coke and in coal specifically. In the U.S., we're seeing demand for initial coke supply from multiple customers. When combined with our desire to introduce a small amount of merchant capacity into our coke battery fleet, we see an opportunity to build at least one more U.S. coke plant with a potential to be larger than our traditional coking batteries. And here, I'm referring to our batteries at Haverhill 1 and 2, as well as our Granite City facility . These facilities typically have 250 and 600,000 tons per year capacity. 
In coal, we're expanding capacity in our existing Jewell mythology for Goldman exceeding production for 1.2 million ton per year to approximately 1.7 million tons per year by the end of 2012. On an annualized basis. We also riddled the completed acquisition of your looking goal, which will take our production to an estimated 2 million tons per year by the end of 2012. Reflecting the elimination of the Jewell multiplier but also the expansion of our call pressure to more price sensitivity at cold is expected to be plus or minus $20 million of the pretax earnings for every $10 per ton moving in coal prices again in a run rate basis by the end of 2012.
Internationally, we see opportunities to expand and grow our footprint was likely for the ventures and our alliances in India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and China, something that we are prioritizing in 2011. Let me turn it back to lead to close the call."

First of all, not of all a lot is trading in the spot markets, the primary source of spot corn, medical in the world is Australia and it's the flooded back as well as now the cycle. If you have to go out and purchase spot met coal today, it's in our best judgment is well above $200,000 of databases really not readily available given what's happened. Most goal is contracted for in a longer basis and though but it's pretty clear a lot of that is a combination of continued demand growth in China, continued demand growth in India for met coal combined with a reasonable outlook in the last and in Brazil, I mean, I think when you look at the symmetry if you will, of coal prices, think 175-dollar, we have a reasonable planning assumption for 2012.

And welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will be discussing the company's fourth quarter earnings as we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer, Fritz Henderson",872,"Thank you and good evening. And welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will be discussing the company's fourth quarter earnings as we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer, Fritz Henderson, who will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy upon separation and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations.
I'll start with a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position and Fritz will provide an update on the Sunoco business. As part of today's call, I’d like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com where we have posted a number of presentation slides which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks.
I’d also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor Statement referenced in slide number two of the slide package and that’s included in this afternoon's earnings release. Now let's begin.
As you can see from slides three and four, we earned $13 million in net income, excluding special items or a $.011 per share. When I look at our performance in the fourth quarter, I see three things.
First, the marketplace continued to be challenging, the weak demand and excess supply in our markets and the rising crude prices continue to put downward pressure on margins, especially in our retail business where it's more difficult to quickly tax through sharper, higher raw material costs. On our refining and supply side, the Northeast region experienced moderate improvement with higher market cracks, but rise in crude prices also factored into refining’s results.
Second, we have additional work to do in the area of operational reliability, which negatively impacted results this quarter, when processing units in our Northeast refineries came down for unscheduled maintenance. Overall, refining unit utilization for the quarter was 85%, well below our planned rate. Along with improved margin capture, operational reliability remain a focus area for us this year.
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. In Sunoco, logistics partners almost 400 million were invested for expansion capital during 2010. Additionally, we recently announced sale of the Toledo refinery to PBF, which we expect to close in the first quarter, the purchase of 25 high quality retail sites in upstate New York and new long-term contracts to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway, starting in 2011 and the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012.
We also continue to be successful in growing our distributor network. These various actions are part of a plan that aim for Sunoco to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in our markets. Despite many challenges in 2010, I'm pleased to say Sunoco made progress against our strategic goals.
We finished the year with $1.5 billion in cash, which provides us with considerable strategic flexibility. We also took steps to achieve growth in our retail and logistics businesses and to improve the overall competitiveness of our refinery.
The work done last year sets the stage for continued progress in 2011. This will only happen if we run our business effectively and in such a way that it can continue to grow even in difficult markets. We cannot count on help for the marketplace. It’s our view that condition in 2011 will be similar to what we saw in 2010.
Our strategy to use our brands to pull fuel through our system depends on a tightly integrated team that executes well at each step of the value chain. And retail, we need to grow and protect the strong Sunoco brands that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year on year sales from fuel and convenience items.
By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at retail, we expect demand will pull product from our refineries and through the pipeline's terminals and branded retail network. I expect Sunoco logistics to continue to integrate recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities inside and outside the traditional Sunoco footprint.
The recent acquisition of the butane blending business and the reversal and conversion of accrued pipeline to product service are good examples of the range of growth opportunities we're willing to consider. Our refineries sit inside one of the largest transportation fuel markets in the world. If we can operate them safely, reliably and efficiently, we can be competitive in the marketplace.
Our refining and supply segment remains focused on the fundamentals. Improved market capture, lower break-even cost per barrel, and operate reliably and safely. The other part of our strategy, separating Sunoco's energy from Sunoco and preparing to operate independently remained the top priority.
The recent acquisition of coal assets contiguous to our dual operation increases our reserves, enables synergies with our existing line and demonstrates how committed we are to preparing SunCoke for its next phase of growth as an independent entity. First we'll talk about our separations in more detail shortly, but I am pleased that we have reached a settlement with ArcelorMittal that resolves the lawsuit concerning Coke pricing at the Jewell facility, and we now can move forward with the separation of the business to unlock shareholder value. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

We delivered another strong quarter in our logistics business and achieved our 2010 full year guidance for the Coke business.
Market conditions were challenging in our retail and refining and supply business this quarter, and operational issues at our refining facilities prevented us from taking advantage of the moderate sequential improvement that did occur in the Northeast market.
As you can see in slide four, refining and supply recorded a pretax loss of $17 million. While we are not satisfying posting a loss in our refining and supply business and we are working on the issues around operational reliability, we also can take a step back and recognize our year-over-year improvement in the business.
We feel confident that the significant improvement is to a large degree the result of actions we have taken, including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, refocusing our market strategy and last, but not least, our initiatives around cost structure.
Our focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Full year 2010 cash operating expenses excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations were approximately $185 million lower than 2009. Excluding the Coke business, where we are adding costs as we grow and prepare for separation, the improvement versus the prior year is approximately $240 million.
This expense measurement, the basis of cash operating expenses, ex fuel and utilities has been used internally to track our progress and reducing our controllable expenses, was also part of our 2010 companywide bonus targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level.
A year ago, we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery. At that time, we communicated our goal to achieve break-even cash flow in our refining and supply business, even within a tough market environment, similar to the one we were experiencing at the time.
As a result of the actions we have taken, for the full year 2010, as you can see on slide five, we generated positive EBITDA that was in excess of our capital requirements for 2010 in the refining and supply business. This represents a tremendous improvement versus 2009 when the business experienced significant cash burn.
While we continue to be pleased with our progress in many of the controllable aspects of our operations, we will continue to maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets and can make the most of the market opportunities that do present themselves.
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to slides four through nine. First, let’s discuss the retail, logistics and Coke segments. Businesses which we continued to believe had the best prospects for growth are retail marketing, logistics and Coke businesses earn $63 million pretax, $47 million after tax in the aggregate during the quarter as detailed on slides four and six.
Retail marketing earned $1 million pretax and $3 million after tax in the fourth quarter 2010. Retail gasoline margins were significantly challenged as crude prices and wholesale gasoline prices were on the rise throughout most of the quarter. While we experienced a challenging quarter, we earned $176 million pretax for the full year 2010, an improvement of $30 million versus the prior year.
We do see volatility in this business quarter to quarter, but historical annual results prove that over time, this business delivers strong, consistent results. We saw strong volumes relative to the challenging quarter one year ago. Gasoline and distillate volumes were up by 1.8% and 7% respectively on an open book year basis.
Additionally, we made progress during the quarter in our retail growth strategy, including the acquisition of 25 sites in New York, newer extended agreements to operate sites on the Ohio Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, and the [Palla States] Parkway, and continued growth in the distributor network. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,900 sites carried the Sunoco flag, and this is a business we continue to target for growth.
Turning now to logistics which earned $37 million pretax, $23 million after tax in the fourth quarter. Earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco’s ownership interest in Sunoco logistics, which continues to be a reliable source of earnings.
The throughput in [tourmaline] business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when [contangle] market structures exist, as was the case in the third quarter and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter. The logistics business also has strong growth opportunities.
Sunoco Logistics spent approximately $390 million in expansion capital during 2010 including both organic and acquisition projects. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partner projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding major acquisitions and project Mariner.
Coke earned $25 million pretax, $21 million after tax in Q4. The Coke business earned $132 million net income after tax for the full year, consistent with the earnings guidance previously provided. Relative to the third quarter, earnings were lower due to spot sales of Coke in the third quarter and higher spending in the fourth quarter related to activities around growth and preparation to be a standalone business.
Additionally, production issues at our Indiana Harbor plant and arbitration and legal costs impacted fourth quarter results. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted our expectation that we would be able to achieve break-even cash flow in the Coke business. We are pleased to report that SunCoke generated EBITDA in excess of capital spending and also generated additional cash flow through working capital in 2010.
This is a significant accomplishment for the business as it prepares to operate as a standalone business. Regarding the separation, now that the Jewell litigation is behind us, Sunoco intends to move forward with the planned separation of SunCoke in a two-step process. Later in the call, Fritz will address the settlement agreement regarding the Jewell plant outlined earning expectations for 2011 and '12 and provide an update on the growth outlook.
Now, turning to refining and supply, as shown on slide seven, refining and supply had a loss of $17 million pretax, or $8 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $227 million pretax, or $135 million after tax in the same quarter 2009. We saw market conditions in the Northeast system improve in the fourth quarter as reflected in the market margins, but we experienced operational issues which hindered our performance.
Our system-wide crude unit utilization rate was 85% for the fourth quarter, which is obviously much lower than the optimal rates given the margin environment. The Northeast system was impacted by operational issues and the Toledo refinery utilization was also negatively impacted by crude oil, pipeline allocation limits.
In the Northeast, both refineries experienced mechanical issues late in the quarter for which maintenance work continues into the first quarter of 2011. We expect to complete the maintenance activities in February and return to normal rates in March. As a result of this work, first quarter utilizations for the Northeast system is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2010.
With respect to our Q4 margin realizations, I refer you to slides eight and nine for more detail on a refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. As you can see on slide eight, our system-wide refining and supply benchmark averaged 611 per barrel for the fourth quarter and margin capture was 78%.
While market margins and market capture rates were both significantly improved from the same quarter of last year, our margin capture was challenged by both rising crude prices and our own operational difficulties. Excluding crude timing, which negatively impacted the capture rate for the second consecutive quarter, margin capture was 86%.
Our operational issues resulted in lack of ratability, which also had a negative impact on our margin capture in the midst of the current volatile price environment. Even with the difficulties experienced in the fourth quarter, we showed significant improvement in margin capture for the full year 2010 versus 2009.
Improvements can be attributed to better reliability and a successful strategy matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability and utilization is both in the Northeast and Toledo, as we were undergoing turnaround activity in Toledo during late 2009.
Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. Specifically, in 2010, 36% of our net production was distillate versus 32% 2009, with the offset being less production of the cheaper residual fuels.
Our actions that supported the improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slates, and the operations of the new hydrotreater unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we seized opportunities to upgrade more of the distillate to ULSD when it was attractive to do so. Northeast ULSD differentials to heating oil widened by $1.5 a gallon year-over-year.
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. We have noted that there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period. Additionally, we recognize that reliability of our refineries is an essential component to strong performance and the fourth quarter is a demonstration of this.
We will remain focused on the fundamentals, those elements within our control that drive strong performance in whatever environment exist. As previously noted, our first quarter utilization is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter due to maintenance work in our Northeast system.
Accordingly, we expect challenged refining and supply results again in the first quarter, given the resulting lower utilization level, along with still-arising crude prices and relatively weaker Northeast market conditions evident thus far. Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of December. In conjunction with that, I'll direct you to slides 10 and 11.
From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt at Sunoco excluding Sunoco Logistics was a source of approximately $360 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $180 million, excluding SXL. This represents a swing of $1.4 billion from the prior year end, when the Sunoco parent was carrying 1.2 billion of net debt.
The cash increase in the quarter was driven by working capital movements as we liquidated inventories related to our Eagle Point refinery, which was shut down in late 2009. We ended the quarter with a net debt to capital ratio of negative 6% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL.
At December 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. As seen on slide 12, our capital spend for 2010 excluding Sunoco Logistics Partners was $614 million, which included $223 million for refining and supply, without the gross spending for the Fulton biofuels plant.
We were successful in managing capital for this business and reduced our total spend by approximately 75 million versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. This reduction has been achieved, primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects, as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. We continue to focus on running safe and reliable operations, but we will also continue to limit the discretionary capital that is put into this business.
As it relates to capital spending expectations for refining and supply in 2011, we are currently in discussions with the appropriate government environmental authorities about the requirements of the 2006 consent decree as it applies to the markets for refinery. As we have previously reported, we have completed projects at the Philadelphia and Toledo refineries under a 2006 consent decree.
We have expected to make additional capital outlays of approximately $200 million as the markets of refinery under the same consent degree by June 30, 2013. We are hopeful that an outcome of these recent discussions will include an extension of the required timeframe for these capital outlays, thus reducing our capital outlays in 2011 and 2012.
This will allow us additional time to explore our options that will lower the costs of the total project. If these discussions are successful and subject to the closing of the Toledo refinery sale, we expect 2011 capital spending and refining and supply business to range from $135 million to $145 million, down from 2010 and below DD&A.
Where we are closely managing our capital spend in the refining and supply business, we are targeting our Coke logistics and retail business for growth opportunities. Our 2011 capital guidance as shown on slide 12 includes approximately $165 million to finish the SunCoke Middletown plant, which is expected to be running late in the second half of 2011.
We also show logistics capital spend including maintenance capital in the range of 145 million to 195 million, which is expected to be funded by Sunoco Logistics Partners and excludes any potential major acquisitions and Project Mariner spend.
Lastly, we continue to pursue growth opportunities in our retail business. These will be opportunitistic and thus are not included in our capital guidance at this time.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the challenging the volatile of refining environment, our final balance sheet note related to inventory. At December 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories devalued at LIFO exceed their carrying value by $3.1 billion.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Fritz Henderson, who will provide an update on the SunCoke business.

305749,118107646,99143,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning Coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective Januar",1012,"Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning Coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 of this year, 2011 and includes the following terms.
First, renegotiation of the Jewell Coke contract, including the elimination of what was called the Jewell coal cost multiplier and the increase in the fees at Jewell. The pricing of Jewell coal will be based upon the third party coal price at SunCoke's Haverhill facility.
Second, renegotiation and increase in the fees paid under the Haverhill agreement. Third, the take or pay basis of the Jewell, of both Jewell and Haverhill agreements with ArcelorMittal will be extended through 2020. This extension provides SunCoke a guarantee outlet for this coke production through 2020 and both of these contracts were previously structured to convert to the basis of ArcelorMittal’s U.S. requirement effective October 2012.
So we extended the take or pay through 2020. Finally, and in addition to resolving the Jewell litigation, earlier this week, we also negotiated a settlement of arbitration claims related to our supply of Coke to ArcelorMittal from our Indiana Harbor site. Costs associated with the settlement were largely accrued in the fourth quarter.
Combined with the Jewell settlement, we have now resolved all of our existing material commercial disputes with ArcelorMitall. Our line is to focus on building a productive dialogue in partnership with our largest customer, including possible extension at the Indiana Harbor contract that expires in 2013.
The Indiana Harbor contract is today the only contract that we have not covered by longer-term take or pay rate. We're pleased to put these matters behind us, so we can continue to move forward with our plans to separate the business and unlock shareholder value.
On the operating side of the business, reflecting both operating and capacity issues that are at the Indiana Harbor facility, we did not deliver to our contractual minimum to 2010. This is the only facility where we missed our minimums in 2010. As the Coke was not required however, there were no shortfall penalties payable by SunCoke.
With regard to 2011, while we're aggressively pursuing other reliability repairs and throughput initiatives, we do not expect to be able to restore volumes to the contractual minimum in the Indiana Harbor and as such, we're working with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements in our own facilities.
Let me take a moment to discuss earnings guidance and turn you to slide 14. In 2011, SunCoke energy is expected to turn EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $200 million, based upon our average contracted coal purchase price for 2011 of approximately $165 per ton.
As compared to 2010 actual results, earnings in 2011 will be lower due to the revised terms of the Jewell Coke contract and higher operating costs related to relocation of the business from Knoxville to Chicago and operation as a standalone company, partially offset by higher coke market prices and higher production related to a full year of Grand City operations and the expected startup of our Middletown operations.
In 2012, with a full year of Middletown operations and increased coal production from our expansion, we expect EBITDA to range from $280 million to $320 million. This assumes coal price of approximately $175 per ton.
Coal purchases have not yet been contracted for 2012. We wouldn't expect them to be contracted for until late in 2011, but at $175, these are well below where we see coal prices in the spot markets today. The net income guidance as shown on the chart flows from EBITDA levels, but does not include any interest expense associated with the yet to be determined capital structure for SunCoke.
As slide 15 reflects, we continue to work towards preparing SunCoke for successful operation as a standalone entity, including preparing for the relocation of our headquarters to Chicago and hiring key leadership. While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally.
As we saw once again in the most recent steel downturn, long-term take or pay agreements provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through this most recent period, for example. Looking forward, beyond the stable base of our existing contracts, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both Coke and in coal specifically.
In the U.S., we're seeing demand for additional Coke supply from multiple customers. When combined with our desire to introduce a small amount of merchant capacity into our Coke battery fleet, we see an opportunity to build at least one more U.S. Coke plant with the potential to be larger than our traditional Coking batteries, and here I'm referring to our batteries in Haverhill one and two as well as Grand City facility and these facilities typically have between 550 and 600,000 tons per year capacity.
And coal were expanding capacity in our existing Jewell metallurgical coal mine increasing production for 1.2 million tons per year to approximately 1.7 million tons per year by the end of 2012 on an annualized basis. Excuse me. We also recently completed the acquisition of Harold Keene Coal, which will take our production to an estimated 2 million tons per year by the end of 2012.
Reflecting the elimination of the jewel multiplier, but also the expansion of our coal production, our price sensitivity to coal is expected to be plus or minus $20 million in pretax earnings, for every $10 per ton movement in coal prices again, on a running rate basis by the end of 2012. Internationally, we see opportunities to expand and grow our footprint, most likely through ventures and/or alliances in India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and China, something we are prioritizing in 2011.
Let me turn it back to Lynn to close the call.

So you're right in saying the, the restructured Arcelor contract is unfavorable relative to prior guidance. Higher coal prices is favorable, but the two pieces missing are, one, we need to update and we did update the coal production costs. And second, we've built in all the standalone costs associated with running the business publicly.

The primary source of spot coal, met coal in the world is Australia, and Australia's being hit by both the flood impact, as well as now the cyclone impact. If you had to go out and purchase spot met coal today, it's in our best judgment is it's well above $200 a ton today, and it's really not readily available, given what's happened.
Most coal is contracted for on a long-term basis, though. But it's pretty clear that combination of continued demand growth in China, continued opportunity -- continued demand growth in India for met coal, combined with a reasonable outlook in the U.S. and in Brazil, I mean, I think that when you look at the symmetry, if you will, of coal prices, we think at $175, we have a reasonable planning assumption for 2012.

Well, starting with some of the issues that we had going back into the fourth quarter of last year, we sequentially took down two desalters at the Philadelphia refinery in order to repair them and repair large amounts of sludge that were making them inoperable and causing us to have environmental exceedances.
And so we went ahead and took the opportunity to deal with that problem. We should get some added benefits from that. But first of all, in the fixes, we’ve done, we also modify calcium removal system that should prevent us from running into the same problem going forward and that was happening mostly as a result of the (inaudible) that we had been running there.
When we get a little bit of a silver lining here, that in addition to fewer environmental exceedances, we would expect to see about a 6000-barrel a day improvement in our ability to crack (inaudible) cat cracker in 2011 relative to 2010. If I go, then, into sort of late December and into the first quarter, we had problems at Philadelphia due to a leak in an overhead crude line that we feel we need to shut down the unit to do a repair. And so that will be done concurrently with repairing a mechanical issue to a key pressure control valve on the cat cracker at Philadelphia.
And we've been running at reduced rates, both on crude and the cat cracker to deal with both of these issues until we shut down, which we'll do in February and would expect to be back up in March. And then at Marcus Hook, we had an unplanned reformer catalyst regeneration and when we took the reformer down, we had to reduce rates at the cat cracker in order to contain processed stocks. And then we took the opportunity then to bring forward some work that had been planned for later. So the good news is we've got work that would have been done later in the year, planned later in the year out of the way, and all of that worked at Marcus Hook has been completed and all the units are online.
Now, that was answering your question around the liability issues.

If you look at their steel consumption per capita, it's at the beginning of the growth curve and that's why you're seeing substantial investment of steel companies in India. China continues to grow. I made the point in my comments that I see our entry strategy as likely being alliances and/or ventures, because I think in some of these -- many of these markets, it would be the best approach for us to do it versus simply trying to do wholly owned, building your own battery. I think it's better for us.
There are merchant Coke suppliers in these markets that we can affiliate with. There are new projects being built, and yes, they do pose interesting opportunities for us. But part of the work is, first, what's the right partner, do we have a good, I'll call it energy of skills and abilities in each organization and putting something together to support steel makers that are significantly expanding capacity into emerging markets, it is a very good opportunity.

So that's where the value creation comes from and we would expect them to be, you know, in line with the rest of our lease type operations. And then on the other piece of that, which doesn't show up on the Sunoco Inc. side is that we think there will be some opportunity to get them slight incremental income on the SXL side that, you know, doesn't show up directly but will show up indirectly. And then about 75-ish, I think, distributor locations and we would expect them to perform very similarly to the other rest of the distributor collective trade.

With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; Fritz Hender",867,"Thank you, and good evening, and welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will be discussing the company's fourth quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; Fritz Henderson, who will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy upon separation; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position, and Fritz will provide an update on the SunCoke business.
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I'd also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor statements referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. Now let's begin. 
As you can see from Slide 3 and 4, we earned $13 million in net income, excluding special items, or $0.11 per share. When I look at our performance in the fourth quarter, I see three things. First, the marketplace continues to be challenging, the weak demand and excess supply in our markets and the rising crude prices continue to put downward pressure on margins, especially in our Retail business where it's more difficult to quickly pass through sharper, higher raw material costs. 
On the Refining and Supply side, the northeast region experienced moderate improvement, with higher market cracks, but rising crude prices also factored into Refining's results. 
Second, we have additional work to do in the area of operational reliability, which negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units in our Northeast refineries came down for unscheduled maintenance. Overall, our refining utilization for the quarter was 85%, well below our planned rate. Along with improved margin capture, operational liabilities remain a focus area for us this year. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. In Sunoco Logistics Partners, almost $400 million was invested for expansion capital during 2010. Additionally, we've recently announced sale of the Toledo refinery to PBF, which we expect to close in the first quarter, the purchase of 25 high-quality retail sites in upstate New York and new long-term contracts to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway, starting in 2011, and the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012. We also continue to be successful in growing our distributor network. 
These various actions are part of a plan that aims for Sunoco to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in our markets. Despite many challenges in 2010, I'm pleased to say Sunoco made progress against our strategic goal. We finished the year with $1.5 billion in cash, which provides us with considerable strategic flexibility. We also took steps to achieve growth in our retail and logistics businesses and to improve the overall competitiveness of our refineries. 
The work done last year sets the stage for continued progress in 2011. This will only happen if we run our business effectively and in such a way that it can continue to grow even in difficult markets. We cannot count on helping the marketplace. It's our view that conditions in 2011 will be similar to what we saw in 2010. 
Our strategy to use our brand to pull fuel through our system depends on a tightly integrated team that executes well at each step of the value chain. In Retail, we need to grow and protect the strong Sunoco brand the customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-on-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at Retail, we expect demand will pull product from our refineries and through the pipelines, terminals and branded retail network. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue to integrate recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities inside and outside the traditional Sunoco footprint. 
The recent acquisition of the butane blending business and the reversal and conversion of accrued pipeline to product service are good examples of the range of growth opportunities we're willing to consider. Our refineries sit inside one of the largest transportation fuel markets in the world. If we can operate them safely, reliably and efficiently, we can be competitive in the marketplace. 
Our Refining and Supply segment remains focused on the fundamentals, improve margin capture, lower our breakeven cost per barrel and operate reliably and safely. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent acquisition of coal assets contiguous to our fuel operation increases our reserves, enables synergies with our existing mines and demonstrates how committed we are to preparing SunCoke for its next phase of growth as an independent entity. 
Fritz will talk about our preparations in more detail shortly, but I am pleased that we have reached a settlement with ArcelorMittal that resolved a lawsuit concerning coke pricing at the Jewell facility, and we now can move forward with the separation of the business to unlock shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of",2448,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of net of favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the liquidation of crude oil and refined product inventories, a provision for asset write-downs attributable to the Eagle Point refinery and pension settlement losses and accruals for employee terminations and related costs in connection with the ongoing business improvement initiative. 
We also recognize net benefit from taxes related to recurring Coke business tax credits, biofuels tax credits granted at year-end and other adjustments to recurring taxes that occur with changes in estimates. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our Logistics business and achieved our 2010 full year guidance for the Coke business. Market conditions were challenging in our Retail and Refining and Supply business this quarter and operational issues at our refining facilities prevented us from taking advantage of the moderate sequential improvement that did occur in the northeast market. 
As you can see in Slide 4, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $17 million. While we are not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business, and we are working on the issues around operational reliability, we also can take a step back and recognize our year-over-year improvement in the business. We feel confident that this significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken, including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, refocusing our market strategy and, last but not least, our initiatives around cost structure. 
Our focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Full year 2010 cash operating expenses, excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations, were approximately $185 million lower than 2009. Excluding the Coke business, where we are adding cost as we grow and prepare for our separation, the improvement versus the prior year is approximately $240 million. This expense measurement basis of cash operating expenses, ex fuel and utilities, has been used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses, was also part of our 2010 companywide bonus targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
A year ago, we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery. At that time, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business even within a tough market environment similar to the one we were experiencing at the time. As a result of the actions we have taken, for the full year 2010, as you can see on Slide 5, we generated positive EBITDA that was in excess of our capital requirements for 2010 in the Refining and Supply business. This represents a tremendous improvement versus 2009 when the business experienced significant cash burn.
So while we continue to be pleased with our progress at many of our controllable aspects of our operations, we will continue to maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets and can make the most of the market opportunities that do present themselves. 
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 9. First, let's discuss the Retail, Logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe had the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $63 million pretax, $47 million after tax in the aggregate or in the quarter, as detailed on Slides 4 and 6. 
Retail Marketing earned $1 million pretax and $3 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins were significantly challenged, as crude prices and wholesale gasoline prices were on the rise throughout most of the quarter. 
While we experienced a challenging quarter, we earned $176 million pretax for the full year 2010, an improvement of $30 million versus the prior year. We do see volatility in this business quarter-to-quarter, but historical annual results proved that over time, this business delivers strong, consistent results. We saw strong volumes relative to the challenging quarter one year ago, gasoline and distillate volumes were up by 1.8% and 7%, respectively on an open both-year basis. Additionally, we made progress during the quarter in our retail growth strategy, including the acquisition of 25 sites in New York, newer extended agreements to operate sites on the Ohio Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Palisades Parkway and continued growth in the distributor network. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,900 sites carried the Sunoco flag and this is the business we continue to target for growth.
Turning now to Logistics, which earned $37 million pretax, $23 million after tax in the fourth quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership interest in Sunoco Logistics, which continues to be a reliable source of earnings. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a rateable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist, as was the case in the third quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter. 
The Logistics business also had strong growth opportunities. Sunoco Logistics spent approximately $390 million in expansion capital during 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million excluding major acquisitions and Project Mariner. 
Coke earned $25 million pretax, $21 million after tax in Q4. The Coke business earned $132 million net income after tax for the full year, consistent with the earnings guidance previously provided. Relative to the third quarter, earnings were lower due to spot sales of coke in the third quarter and higher spending in the fourth quarter related to activities around growth and preparation to be a standalone business. Additionally, production issues at our Indiana Harbor plant and arbitration and legal costs impacted fourth quarter results. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted our expectation that we would be able to achieve breakeven cash flow in the Coke business. We are pleased to report that SunCoke generated EBITDA in excess of capital spending and also generated additional cash flow to working capital in 2010. This is a significant accomplishment for the business, as it prepares to operate as a standalone business. 
Regarding the separation, now that the Jewell litigation is behind us, Sunoco intends to move forward with the planned separation of SunCoke in a two-step process. Later in the call, Fritz will address the settlement agreement regarding the Jewell plant, outline earning expectations for 2011 and '12 and provide an update on the growth outlook.
Now turning to Refining and Supply, as shown on Slide 7. Refining and Supply had a loss of $17 million pretax, or $8 million after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $227 million pretax, or $135 million after tax, in the same quarter in 2009. We saw market conditions in the Northeast system improve in the fourth quarter, as reflected in the market margins, but we experienced operational issues which hindered our performance. 
Our systemwide crude unit utilization rate was 85% for the fourth quarter, which is obviously much lower than the optimal rates, given the margin environment. The Northeast system was impacted by operational issues and the Toledo refinery utilization was also negatively impacted by crude oil pipeline allocation limits. 
In the northeast, both refineries experienced mechanical issues late in the quarter, for which maintenance work continues into the first quarter of 2011. We expect to complete the maintenance activities in February and return to normal rates in March. As a result of this work, first quarter utilization for the Northeast system is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2010. With respect to our Q4 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 8 and 9 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our systemwide Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the fourth quarter and margin capture was 78%. While market margins and market capture rates were both significantly improved from the same quarter of last year, our margin capture was challenged by both rising crude prices and our own operational difficulties. Excluding crude timing, which negatively impacted the capture rate for the second consecutive quarter, margin capture was 86%. Our operational issues resulted in lack of rateability, which also had a negative impact on our margin  capture in the midst of the current volatile pricing environment. 
Even with the difficulties experienced in the fourth quarter, we showed significant improvement in margin capture for the full year 2010 versus 2009. Our improvements can be attributed to better reliability and a successful strategy, matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability and utilization is both in the northeast and Toledo, as we were undergoing turnaround activity in Toledo during late 2009. Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. Specifically in 2010, 36% of our net production was distillate versus 32% in 2009, with the offset being less production of the cheaper residual fuels. Our actions that supported the improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slates and the operations of the new hydrotreater unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we seized opportunities to upgrade more of the distillate to ULSD when it was attractive to do so. Northeast ULSD differentials to heating oil widened by $0.15 a gallon year-over-year. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. We have noted that there can be market factors,which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period. Additionally, we recognize that reliability of our refineries is an essential component to strong performance, and the fourth quarter is a demonstration of this. We will remain focused on the fundamentals, those elements within our control, to drive strong performance in whatever environment exists. 
As previously noted, our first quarter utilization is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, due to maintenance work in our Northeast system. Accordingly, we expect challenged Refining and Supply results again in the first quarter, given the resulting lower utilization level, along with still rising crude prices and relatively weaker northeast market conditions evident thus far. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of December. In conjunction with that, I'll direct you to Slide 10 and 11. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics, was a source of approximately $360 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $180 million, excluding SXL. This represents a swing of $1.4 billion from the prior year-end, when the Sunoco parent was carrying $1.2 billion of net debt. The cash increase in the quarter was driven by working capital movements, as we liquidated inventories related to our Eagle Point refinery, which was shut down in late 2009. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 6% at the Sunoco level, excluding SXL. 
At December 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. As seen on Slide 12, our capital spend for 2010, excluding Sunoco Logistics Partners, was $614 million, which included $223 million for Refining and Supply without the gross spending for the Fulton biofuels plant. We were successful in managing capital for this business and reduced our total spend by approximately $75 million versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. This reduction has been achieved, primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects, as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. We continue to focus on running safe and reliable operations, but we will also continue to limit the discretionary capital that is put into this business. 
As it relates to capital spending expectations for Refining and Supply in 2011, we are currently in discussions with the appropriate government environmental authorities about the requirements of the 2006 Consent Decree as it applies to the Marcus Hook Refinery. As we have previously reported, we have completed projects at the Philadelphia and Toledo refineries under a 2006 Consent Decree. We had expected to make additional capital outlays of approximately $200 million at the Marcus Hook refinery under the same Consent Decree by June 30, 2013. We are hopeful that an outcome of these recent discussions will include an extension of the required timeframe for these capital outlays, thus reducing our capital outlays in 2011 and 2012. This will allow us additional time to explore options that will lower the cost of the total project. If these discussions are successful and subject to the closing of the Toledo refinery sale, we expect 2011 capital spending in Refining and Supply business to range from $135 million to $145 million, down from 2010 and below DD&A. 
While we are closely managing our capital spend in the Refining and Supply business, we are targeting our Coke, Logistics and Retail businesses for growth opportunities. Our 2011 capital guidance, as shown on Slide 12, includes approximately $165 million to finish the SunCoke Middletown plant, which is expected to be running late in the second half of 2011. We also showed logistics capital spend, including maintenance capital, in the range of $145 million to $195 million, which is expected to be funded by Sunoco Logistics Partners and excludes any potential major acquisitions and Project Mariner spend. 
Lastly, we've continued to pursue growth opportunities in our Retail business. These will be opportunistic and thus are not included in our capital guidance at this time.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility, to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the challenging and volatile refining environment. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At December 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.1 billion. Now I'll turn the call over to Fritz Henderson who will provide an update on the SunCoke business."
305749,118107646,99179,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective Ja",994,"Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 of this year, 2011, and includes the following terms. First, a renegotiation of the Jewell coke contract, including the elimination of what was called the Jewell coal coast multiplier and an increase in the fees at Jewell. The pricing of Jewell coal will be based upon the third-party coal price at SunCoke's Haverhill facility. Second, a renegotiation and increase in the fees paid under the Haverhill agreement. Third, the take-or-pay basis of both Jewell and Haverhill agreements with ArcelorMittal will be extended through 2020. This extension provides SunCoke a guarantee outlet for this coke production through 2020, and both of these contracts were previously structured to convert to the basis of ArcelorMittal's U.S. requirement effective 2012, so we extended the take-or-pay through 2020. 
Finally, in addition to resolving the Jewell litigation, earlier this week, we also negotiated a settlement of arbitration claims related to our supply of coke to ArcelorMittal from our Indiana Harbor site. Costs associated with the settlement were largely accrued in the fourth quarter. Combined with the Jewell settlement, we have now resolved all of our existing material and commercial disputes with ArcelorMittal, allowing us to focus on building a productive dialogue in partnership with our largest customer, including possible extension of the Indiana Harbor contract that expires in 2013. The Indiana Harbor contract is, to date, the only contract that we have not covered by longer-term take-or-pay arrangements. We're pleased to put these matters behind us, but we continue to move forward with our plans to separate the business and unlock shareholder value.
On the operating side of the business, reflecting both operating and capacity issues at our Indiana Harbor facility, we did not deliver to our contractual minimum to 2010. This was the only facility where we missed our minimum since 2010. As the coke was not required, however, there were no shortfall penalties payable by SunCoke. 
With regard to 2011, while we're aggressively pursuing oven reliability repairs and throughput initiatives, we do not expect to be able to restore volumes to the contractual minimum at Indiana Harbor, and as such, we're working with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements in our own facilities. 
Let me take a moment to discuss earnings guidance. Turning to Slide 14. In 2011, SunCoke Energy is expected to earn EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $200 million, based upon our average contracted coal purchase price for 2011 of approximately $165 per ton. As compared to 2010 actual results, earnings in 2011 will be lower due to the revised terms of the Jewell coke contract and higher operating costs related to relocation of the business, from Knoxville to Chicago, and operation as a standalone company, partially offset by higher coke market prices and higher production related to a full year of Granite City operations and the expected startup of our Middletown operations. 
In 2012, with a full year of Middletown operations and increased coal production from our expansion, we expect EBITDA to range from $280 million to $320 million. This assumes a coal price of approximately $175 per ton. Coal purchases have not yet been contracted for 2012. They wouldn't expect them to be contracted forward until late in 2011, but at $175, these are well below where we see coal prices in the spot markets today. 
The net income guidance shown on the chart flows from the EBITDA levels but does not include any interest expense associated with the yet-to-be-determined capital structure for SunCoke.
As Slide 15 reflects, we continue to work towards preparing SunCoke for a successful operation as a standalone entity, including preparing for the relocation of our headquarters to Chicago and hiring key leadership. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we saw once again in the most recent steel downturn, long-term take-or-pay agreements provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments to this most recent period, for example. Looking forward, beyond the stable base of our existing contracts, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and in coal, specifically. In the U.S., we're seeing demand for additional coke supply from multiple customers. When combined with our desire to introduce a small amount of merchant capacity into our coke battery fleet, we see an opportunity to build at least one more U.S. coke plant, with a potential to be larger than our traditional coking batteries. And here, I'm referring to our batteries at Haverhill 1 and 2 as well as our Granite City facility. These facilities typically have between 550,000 and 600,000 tons per year capacity. 
In coal, we're expanding capacity in our existing Jewell metallurgical coal mine, increasing production from 1.2 million tons per year to approximately 1.7 million tons per year by the end of 2012 on an annualized basis. We also recently completed the acquisition of Harold Keene Coal, which will take our production to an estimated 2 million tons per year by the end of 2012. Reflected in the elimination of the Jewell multiplier, but also the expansion of our coal production, our price sensitivity to coal is expected to be plus or minus $20 million in pretax earnings for every $10 per ton movement in coal prices, again on a running rate basis, by the end of 2012.
Internationally, we see opportunity to expand and grow our footprint, most likely through ventures and/or alliances in India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and China, something we are prioritizing in 2011. Let me turn it back to Lynn to close the call."

First, on the perspective filing. Due to SEC regulations and under the advice of counsel, it would not be appropriate to comment beyond what we've said in the script, mainly that we are proceeding with the separation, and the separation will be a two-step process. With regard to your second question around the timing, as we go through the separation process, certain events are under our control and certain events aren't. Part of the separation process will involve going through certain SEC filings and related processes, and those processes, as an example, are not fully in our control. As you noted, we've settled the Arcelor matter, and we're moving forward as expeditiously as possible. And we plan to effect the separation as soon as practicable, and clearly, we would like to get the step, first step of separation, done as soon as possible."

We talked about, when I went through the presentation -- basically, when you look at the sensitivity to coal prices, once you get to 2 million tons, the sensitivity is 2 million x $10 hours. So it's plus or minus $20 million of pretax profit for every $10 movement in the price of coal. Because you would hold, at that point, your production cost constant, and all you're doing is guaranteeing the price. So your first question on where coal prices are today. First of all, not a lot of trading in the spot market. The primary source of spot coal, met coal, in the world is Australia, and Australia's being hit by both the flood impact, as well as now the cyclone impact. If you had to go out and purchase spot met coal today, it's -- in our best judgment, it's well above $200 a ton today. And it's really not readily available, given what's happened. Most coal is contracted for on a long-term basis, though. But it's pretty clear [indiscernible] a lot that -- the combination of continued demand growth in China, continued demand growth in India for met coal, combined with a reasonable outlook in the U.S and in Brazil, I mean, I think that when you look at the symmetry, if you will, of coal prices, we think at $175, we have a reasonable planning assumption for 2012. Obviously, we won't know that until we get later into 2012, but based upon what I know, it fees like a pretty reasonable assumption for us to make."

We should get some added benefit from that -- well, first of all, in the fixes we've done, and we also modified a calcium removal system that should prevent us from running into the same problem going forward, and that was happening mostly as a result of the Doba that we had been running there. And we get a little bit of a silver lining here, in that in addition to fewer environmental exceedances, we would expect to see about a 6,000 barrel a day improvement in our ability to crack resid at the cat cracker in 2011 relative to 2010. If I go then into sort of late December and into the first quarter, we had problems at Philadelphia due to a leak in an overhead crude line that we feel we need to shut down the unit to do a repair. And so that will be done concurrently with repairing a mechanical issue to a key pressure control valve on the cat cracker at Philadelphia. And we've been running at reduced rates, both on the crude and the cat cracker, to deal with both of these issues until we shut down, which we'd do in February, and would expect to be back up in March. And then at Marcus Hook, we had an unplanned reformer catalyst regeneration, and when we took the reformer down, we had to reduce rates at the cat cracker in order to contain process stocks. And we took the opportunity, then, to bring forward some work that had been planned for later, so the good news is that we've got some work that would would've been down later in the year, planned for later in the year, out of the way.

I think it's better for us. There are merchant coke suppliers in these markets that we could affiliate with. There are new projects being built and, yes, they do pose interesting opportunities for us. But part of the work is, first, what's the right partner?

With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; Fritz Henderson, who will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy upon separation; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position, and Fritz will provide an update on the SunCoke business.
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I'd also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor statements referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. Now let's begin. 
As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we earned $13 million in net income excluding special items, or $0.11 per share. When I look at our performance in the fourth quarter, I see three things. First, the marketplace continued to be challenging, the weak demand and excess supply in our markets and the rising crude prices continue to put downward pressure on margins, especially in our Retail business, where it's more difficult to quickly pass through sharper, higher raw material costs. 
On the Refining and Supply side, the northeast region experienced moderate improvement with higher market cracks, but rising crude prices also factored into Refining's results. 
Second, we have additional work to do in the area of operational reliability, which negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units in our Northeast refineries came down for unscheduled maintenance. Overall, our refining utilization for the quarter was 85%, well below our planned rate. Along with improved margin capture, operational liabilities remain a focus area for us this year. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. In Sunoco Logistics Partners, almost $400 million was invested for expansion capital during 2010. Additionally, we've recently announced sale of the Toledo refinery to PBF, which we expect to close in the first quarter, the purchase of 25 high-quality retail sites in upstate New York and new long-term contracts to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway starting in 2011 and the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012. We also continue to be successful in growing our distributor network. 
These various actions are part of a plan that aims for Sunoco to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in our markets. Despite many challenges in 2010, I'm pleased to say Sunoco made progress against our strategic goal. We finished the year with $1.5 billion in cash, which provides us with considerable strategic flexibility. We also took steps to achieve growth in our retail and logistics businesses and to improve the overall competitiveness of our refineries. 
The work done last year sets the stage for continued progress in 2011. This will only happen if we run our business effectively and in such a way that it can continue to grow even in difficult markets. We cannot count on helping the marketplace. It's our view that conditions in 2011 will be similar to what we saw in 2010. 
Our strategy to use our brand to pull fuel through our system depends on a tightly integrated team that executes well at each step of the value chain. In Retail, we need to grow and protect the strong Sunoco brand that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-on-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at Retail, we expect demand will pull product from our refineries and through the pipelines, terminals and branded retail network. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue to integrate recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities inside and outside the traditional Sunoco footprint. 
The recent acquisition of the butane blending business and the reversal and conversion of accrued pipeline to product service are good examples of the range of growth opportunities we're willing to consider. Our refineries sit inside one of the largest transportation fuel markets in the world. If we can operate them safely, reliably and efficiently, we can be competitive in the marketplace. 
Our Refining and Supply segment remains focused on the fundamentals:  improve margin capture, lower our breakeven cost per barrel and operate reliably and safely. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent acquisition of coal assets contiguous to our fuel operation increases our reserves, enables synergies with our existing mines and demonstrates how committed we are to preparing SunCoke for its next phase of growth as an independent entity. 
Fritz will talk about our preparations in more detail shortly, but I am pleased that we have reached a settlement with ArcelorMittal that resolved a lawsuit concerning coke pricing at the Jewell facility, and we now can move forward with the separation of the business to unlock shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
305749,118107646,99180,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of",2447,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of net of favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the liquidation of crude oil and refined product inventories, a provision for asset write-downs attributable to the Eagle Point refinery and pension settlement losses and accruals for employee terminations and related costs in connection with the ongoing business improvement initiative. 
We also recognize net benefit from taxes related to recurring Coke business tax credits, biofuels tax credits granted at year-end and other adjustments to recurring taxes that occur with changes in estimates. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our Logistics business and achieved our 2010 full year guidance for the Coke business. Market conditions were challenging in our Retail and Refining and Supply business this quarter, and operational issues at our refining facilities prevented us from taking advantage of the moderate sequential improvement that did occur in the northeast market. 
As you can see in Slide 4, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $17 million. While we are not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business and we are working on the issues around operational reliability, we also can take a step back and recognize our year-over-year improvement in the business. We feel confident that this significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken, including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, refocusing our market strategy and, last but not least, our initiatives around cost structure. 
Our focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Full year 2010 cash operating expenses excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations were approximately $185 million lower than 2009. Excluding the Coke business, where we are adding costs as we grow and prepare for our separation, the improvement versus the prior year is approximately $240 million. This expense measurement basis of cash operating expenses ex fuel and utilities has been used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses, was also part of our 2010 company-wide bonus targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
A year ago, we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery. At that time, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business, even within a tough market environment similar to the one we were experiencing at the time. As a result of the actions we have taken, for the full year 2010, as you can see on Slide 5, we generated positive EBITDA that was in excess of our capital requirements for 2010 in the Refining and Supply business. This represents a tremendous improvement versus 2009, when the business experienced significant cash burn.
So while we continue to be pleased with our progress at many of our controllable aspects of our operations, we will continue to maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets and can make the most of the market opportunities that do present themselves. 
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 9. First, let's discuss the Retail, Logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $63 million pretax, $47 million after tax, in the aggregate or in the quarter, as detailed on Slides 4 and 6. 
Retail Marketing earned $1 million pretax and $3 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins were significantly challenged as crude prices and wholesale gasoline prices were on the rise throughout most of the quarter. 
While we experienced a challenging quarter, we earned $176 million pretax for the full year 2010, an improvement of $30 million versus the prior year. We do see volatility in this business quarter-to-quarter, but historical annual results prove that over time, this business delivers strong, consistent results. We saw strong volumes relative to the challenging quarter one year ago.  Gasoline and distillate volumes were up by 1.8% and 7%, respectively, on an open both-year basis. Additionally, we made progress during the quarter in our retail growth strategy, including the acquisition of 25 sites in New York, newer extended agreements to operate sites on the Ohio Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Palisades Parkway and continued growth in the distributor network. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,900 sites carried the Sunoco flag, and this is the business we continue to target for growth.
Turning now to Logistics, which earned $37 million pretax, $23 million after tax in the fourth quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership interest in Sunoco Logistics, which continues to be a reliable source of earnings. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a rateable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist, as was the case in the third quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter. 
The Logistics business also has strong growth opportunities. Sunoco Logistics spent approximately $390 million in expansion capital during 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million excluding major acquisitions and Project Mariner. 
Coke earned $25 million pretax, $21 million after tax in Q4. The Coke business earned $132 million net income after tax for the full year, consistent with the earnings guidance previously provided. Relative to the third quarter, earnings were lower due to spot sales of coke in the third quarter and higher spending in the fourth quarter related to activities around growth and preparation to be a standalone business. Additionally, production issues at our Indiana Harbor plant and arbitration and legal costs impacted fourth quarter results. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted our expectation that we would be able to achieve breakeven cash flow in the Coke business. We are pleased to report that SunCoke generated EBITDA in excess of capital spending and also generated additional cash flow to working capital in 2010. This is a significant accomplishment for the business to operate as a stand-alone business. 
Regarding the separation, now that the Jewell litigation is behind us, Sunoco intends to move forward with the planned separation of SunCoke in a two-step process. Later in the call, Fritz will address the settlement agreement regarding the Jewell plant, outline earning expectations for 2011 and '12 and provide an update on the growth outlook.
Now turning to Refining and Supply.  As shown on Slide 7, refining and Supply had a loss of $17 million pretax or $8 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $227 million pretax or $135 million after tax in the same quarter in 2009. We saw market conditions in the Northeast system improve in the fourth quarter, as reflected in the market margins, but we experienced operational issues which hindered our performance. 
Our systemwide crude unit utilization rate was 85% for the fourth quarter, which is obviously much lower than the optimal rates given the margin environment. The Northeast system was impacted by operational issues, and the Toledo refinery utilization was also negatively impacted by crude oil pipeline allocation limits. 
In the northeast, both refineries experienced mechanical issues late in the quarter for which maintenance work continues into the first quarter of 2011. We expect to complete the maintenance activities in February and return to normal rates in March. As a result of this work, first quarter utilization for the Northeast system is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2010. With respect to our Q4 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 8 and 9 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our systemwide Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the fourth quarter, and margin capture was 78%. While market margins and market capture rates were both significantly improved from the same quarter of last year, our margin capture was challenged by both rising crude prices and our own operational difficulties. Excluding crude timing, which negatively impacted the capture rate for the second consecutive quarter, margin capture was 86%. Our operational issues resulted in lack of rateability, which also had a negative impact on our margin  capture in the midst of the current volatile price environment. 
Even with the difficulties experienced in the fourth quarter, we showed significant improvement in margin capture for the full year 2010 versus 2009. Our improvements can be attributed to better reliability and a successful strategy, matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability and utilization is both in the northeast and Toledo, as we were undergoing turnaround activity in Toledo during late 2009. Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. Specifically in 2010, 36% of our net production was distillate versus 32% in 2009, with the offset being less production of the cheaper residual fuels. Our actions that supported the improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slates and the operations of the new hydrotreater unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we seized opportunities to upgrade more of the distillate to ULSD when it was attractive to do so. Northeast ULSD differentials to heating oil widened by $0.015 a gallon year-over-year. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. We have noted that there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period. Additionally, we recognize that reliability of our refineries is an essential component to strong performance, and the fourth quarter is a demonstration of this. We will remain focused on the fundamentals, those elements within our control, to drive strong performance in whatever environment exists. 
As previously noted, our first quarter utilization is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, due to maintenance work in our northeast system. Accordingly, we expect challenged Refining and Supply results again in the first quarter, given the resulting lower utilization level, along with still-rising crude prices and relatively weaker northeast market conditions evident thus far. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of December. In conjunction with that, I'll direct you to Slides 10 and 11. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics, was a source of approximately $360 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $180 million, excluding SXL. This represents a swing of $1.4 billion from the prior year end, when the Sunoco parent was carrying $1.2 billion of net debt. The cash increase in the quarter was driven by working capital movements as we liquidated inventories related to our Eagle Point refinery, which was shut down in late 2009. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 6% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL. 
At December 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. As seen on Slide 12, our capital spend for 2010, excluding Sunoco Logistics Partners, was $614 million, which included $223 million for Refining and Supply without the gross spending for the Fulton biofuels plant. We were successful in managing capital for this business and reduced our total spend by approximately $75 million versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. This reduction has been achieved primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. We continue to focus on running safe and reliable operations, but we will also continue to limit the discretionary capital that is put into this business. 
As it relates to capital spending expectations for Refining and Supply in 2011, we are currently in discussions with the appropriate government environmental authorities about the requirements of the 2006 Consent Decree as it applies to the Marcus Hook Refinery. As we have previously reported, we have completed projects at the Philadelphia and Toledo refineries under a 2006 Consent Decree. We had expected to make additional capital outlays of approximately $200 million at the Marcus Hook refinery under the same Consent Decree by June 30, 2013. We are hopeful that an outcome of these recent discussions will include an extension of the required timeframe for these capital outlays, thus reducing our capital outlays in 2011 and 2012. This will allow us additional time to explore options that will lower the cost of the total project. If these discussions are successful, and subject to the closing of the Toledo refinery sale, we expect 2011 capital spending in Refining and Supply business to range from $135 million to $145 million, down from 2010 and below DD&A. 
While we are closely managing our capital spend in the Refining and Supply business, we are targeting our Coke, Logistics and Retail businesses for growth opportunities. Our 2011 capital guidance, as shown on Slide 12, includes approximately $165 million to finish the SunCoke Middletown plant, which is expected to be running late in the second half of 2011. We also showed logistics capital spend, including maintenance capital, in the range of $145 million to $195 million, which is expected to be funded by Sunoco Logistics Partners and excludes any potential major acquisitions and Project Mariner spend. 
Lastly, we've continued to pursue growth opportunities in our Retail business. These will be opportunistic and thus are not included in our capital guidance at this time.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility, to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses as well as ride out the challenging and volatile refining environment. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At December 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.1 billion. Now I'll turn the call over to Fritz Henderson, who will provide an update on the SunCoke business."
305749,118107646,99180,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective Ja",992,"Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 of this year, 2011, and includes the following terms. First, a renegotiation of the Jewell coke contract, including the elimination of what was called the Jewell coal cost multiplier, and an increase in the fees at Jewell. The pricing of Jewell coal will be based upon the third-party coal price at SunCoke's Haverhill facility. Second, a renegotiation and increase in the fees paid under the Haverhill agreement. Third, the take-or-pay basis of both Jewell and Haverhill agreements with ArcelorMittal will be extended through 2020. This extension provides SunCoke a guaranteed outlet for this coke production through 2020, and both of these contracts were previously structured to convert to the basis of ArcelorMittal's U.S. requirement effective October 2012, so we extended the take-or-pay through 2020. 
Finally, in addition to resolving the Jewell litigation, earlier this week, we also negotiated a settlement of arbitration claims related to our supply of coke to ArcelorMittal from our Indiana Harbor site. Costs associated with the settlement were largely accrued in the fourth quarter. Combined with the Jewell settlement, we have now resolved all of our existing material and commercial disputes with ArcelorMittal, allowing us to focus on building a productive dialogue in partnership with our largest customer, including possible extension of the Indiana Harbor contract that expires in 2013. The Indiana Harbor contract is, to date, the only contract that we have not covered by longer-term take-or-pay arrangements. We're pleased to put these matters behind us, but we continue to move forward with our plans to separate the business and unlock shareholder value.
On the operating side of the business, reflecting both operating and capacity issues at our Indiana Harbor facility, we did not deliver to our contractual minimum to 2010. This was the only facility where we missed our minimums in 2010. As the coke was not required, however, there were no shortfall penalties payable by SunCoke. 
With regard to 2011, while we're aggressively pursuing oven reliability repairs and throughput initiatives, we do not expect to be able to restore volumes to the contractual minimums at Indiana Harbor, and as such, we're working with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements in our own facilities. 
Let me take a moment to discuss earnings guidance. Turning to Slide 14. In 2011, SunCoke Energy is expected to earn EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $200 million, based upon our average contracted coal purchase price for 2011 of approximately $165 per ton. As compared to 2010 actual results, earnings in 2011 will be lower due to the revised terms of the Jewell coke contract and higher operating costs related to relocation of the business from Knoxville to Chicago and operation as a standalone company, partially offset by higher coke market prices and higher production related to a full year of Granite City operation and the expected startup of our Middletown operations. 
In 2012, with a full year of Middletown operations and increased coal production from our expansion, we expect EBITDA to range from $280 million to $320 million. This assumes a coal price of approximately $175 per ton. Coal purchases have not yet been contracted for 2012. They wouldn't expect them to be contracted forward until late in 2011, but at $175, these are well below where we see coal prices in the spot markets today. 
The net income guidance shown on the chart flows from the EBITDA levels but does not include any interest expense associated with the yet-to-be-determined capital structure for SunCoke.
As Slide 15 reflects, we continue to work towards preparing SunCoke for successful operation as a standalone entity, including preparing for the relocation of our headquarters to Chicago and hiring key leadership. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we saw once again in the most recent steel downturn, long-term take-or-pay agreements provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through this most recent period, for example. Looking forward, beyond the stable base of our existing contracts, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and in coal.  Specifically, in the U.S., we're seeing demand for additional coke supply from multiple customers. When combined with our desire to introduce a small amount of merchant capacity into our coke battery fleet, we see an opportunity to build at least one more U.S. coke plant, with the potential to be larger than our traditional coking batteries. And here, I'm referring to our batteries at Haverhill 1 and 2 as well as our Granite City facility. These facilities typically have between 550,000 and 600,000 tons per year capacity. 
In coal, we're expanding capacity in our existing Jewell metallurgical coal mine, increasing production from 1.2 million tons per year to approximately 1.7 million tons per year by the end of 2012 on an annualized basis. We also recently completed the acquisition of Harold Keene Coal, which will take our production to an estimated 2 million tons per year by the end of 2012. Reflected in the elimination of the Jewell multiplier, but also the expansion of our coal production, our price sensitivity to coal is expected to be plus or minus $20 million in pretax earnings for every $10-per-ton movement in coal prices, again on the running rate basis, by the end of 2012.
Internationally, we see opportunity to expand and grow our footprint, most likely through ventures and/or alliances in India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and China, something we are prioritizing in 2011. Let me turn it back to Lynn to close the call."

We talked about, when I went through the presentation -- basically, when you look at the sensitivity to coal prices, once you get to 2 million tons, the sensitivity is 2 million x $10. So it's plus or minus $20 million of pretax profit for every $10 movement in the price of coal. Because you would hold, at that point, your production cost constant, and all you're doing is guaranteeing the price. So your first question on where coal prices are today. First of all, not a lot of trading in the spot market. The primary source of spot coal, met coal, in the world is Australia, and Australia's being hit by both the flood impact as well as now the cyclone impact. If you had to go out and purchase spot met coal today, it's -- in our best judgment, it's well above $200 a ton today. And it's really not readily available, given what's happened. Most coal is contracted for on a long-term basis, though. But it's pretty clear [indiscernible] a lot that -- the combination of continued demand growth in China, continued demand growth in India for met coal, combined with a reasonable outlook in the U.S and in Brazil -- I mean, I think that when you look at the symmetry, if you will, of coal prices, we think at $175, we have a reasonable planning assumption for 2012. Obviously, we won't know that until we get later into 2012, but based upon what I know, it feels like a pretty reasonable assumption for us to make."

We should get some added benefit from that -- well, first of all, in the fixes we've done, we also modified a calcium removal system that should prevent us from running into the same problem going forward, and that was happening mostly as a result of the Doba that we had been running there.

If I go, then, into sort of late December and into the first quarter, we had problems at Philadelphia due to a leak in an overhead crude line that we feel we need to shut down the unit to do a repair. And so that will be done concurrently with repairing a mechanical issue to a key pressure control valve on the cat cracker at Philadelphia. And we've been running at reduced rates, both on the crude and the cat cracker, to deal with both of these issues until we shut down, which we'd do in February and would expect to be back up in March. And then at Marcus Hook, we had an unplanned reformer catalyst regeneration, and when we took the reformer down, we had to reduce rates at the cat cracker in order to contain process stocks. And we took the opportunity then to bring forward some work that had been planned for later, so the good news is that we've got some work that would would've been done later in the year, planned for later in the year, out of the way.

I think it's better for us. There are merchant coke suppliers in these markets that we could affiliate with. There are new projects being built, and, yes, they do pose interesting opportunities for us. But part of the work is, first, what's the right partner? Do we have a good, I'll call it, synergy of the skills and abilities in each organization?

With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; Fritz Henderson, who will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy upon separation; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position, and Fritz will provide an update on the SunCoke business.
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I'd also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor statements referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. Now let's begin. 
As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we earned $13 million in net income excluding special items, or $0.11 per share. When I look at our performance in the fourth quarter, I see three things. First, the marketplace continued to be challenging, the weak demand and excess supply in our markets and the rising crude prices continue to put downward pressure on margins, especially in our Retail business, where it's more difficult to quickly pass through sharper, higher raw material costs. 
On the Refining and Supply side, the northeast region experienced moderate improvement with higher market cracks, but rising crude prices also factored into Refining's results. 
Second, we have additional work to do in the area of operational reliability, which negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units in our Northeast refineries came down for unscheduled maintenance. Overall, our refining utilization for the quarter was 85%, well below our planned rate. Along with improved margin capture, operational liabilities remain a focus area for us this year. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. In Sunoco Logistics Partners, almost $400 million was invested for expansion capital during 2010. Additionally, we've recently announced sale of the Toledo refinery to PBF, which we expect to close in the first quarter, the purchase of 25 high-quality retail sites in upstate New York and new long-term contracts to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway starting in 2011 and the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012. We also continue to be successful in growing our distributor network. 
These various actions are part of a plan that aims for Sunoco to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in our markets. Despite many challenges in 2010, I'm pleased to say Sunoco made progress against our strategic goal. We finished the year with $1.5 billion in cash, which provides us with considerable strategic flexibility. We also took steps to achieve growth in our retail and logistics businesses and to improve the overall competitiveness of our refineries. 
The work done last year sets the stage for continued progress in 2011. This will only happen if we run our business effectively and in such a way that it can continue to grow even in difficult markets. We cannot count on helping the marketplace. It's our view that conditions in 2011 will be similar to what we saw in 2010. 
Our strategy to use our brand to pull fuel through our system depends on a tightly integrated team that executes well at each step of the value chain. In Retail, we need to grow and protect the strong Sunoco brand that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-on-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at Retail, we expect demand will pull product from our refineries and through the pipelines, terminals and branded retail network. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue to integrate recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities inside and outside the traditional Sunoco footprint. 
The recent acquisition of the butane blending business and the reversal and conversion of accrued pipeline to product service are good examples of the range of growth opportunities we're willing to consider. Our refineries sit inside one of the largest transportation fuel markets in the world. If we can operate them safely, reliably and efficiently, we can be competitive in the marketplace. 
Our Refining and Supply segment remains focused on the fundamentals:  improve margin capture, lower our breakeven cost per barrel and operate reliably and safely. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent acquisition of coal assets contiguous to our fuel operation increases our reserves, enables synergies with our existing mines and demonstrates how committed we are to preparing SunCoke for its next phase of growth as an independent entity. 
Fritz will talk about our preparations in more detail shortly, but I am pleased that we have reached a settlement with ArcelorMittal that resolved a lawsuit concerning coke pricing at the Jewell facility, and we now can move forward with the separation of the business to unlock shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
305749,118107646,99196,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of",2447,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax income of $121 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the fourth quarter, which included $123 million pretax of net of favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the liquidation of crude oil and refined product inventories, a provision for asset write-downs attributable to the Eagle Point refinery and pension settlement losses and accruals for employee terminations and related costs in connection with the ongoing business improvement initiative. 
We also recognize net benefit from taxes related to recurring Coke business tax credits, biofuels tax credits granted at year-end and other adjustments to recurring taxes that occur with changes in estimates. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our Logistics business and achieved our 2010 full year guidance for the Coke business. Market conditions were challenging in our Retail and Refining and Supply business this quarter, and operational issues at our refining facilities prevented us from taking advantage of the moderate sequential improvement that did occur in the northeast market. 
As you can see in Slide 4, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $17 million. While we are not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business and we are working on the issues around operational reliability, we also can take a step back and recognize our year-over-year improvement in the business. We feel confident that this significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken, including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, refocusing our market strategy and, last but not least, our initiatives around cost structure. 
Our focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Full year 2010 cash operating expenses excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations were approximately $185 million lower than 2009. Excluding the Coke business, where we are adding costs as we grow and prepare for our separation, the improvement versus the prior year is approximately $240 million. This expense measurement basis of cash operating expenses ex fuel and utilities has been used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses, was also part of our 2010 company-wide bonus targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
A year ago, we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery. At that time, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business, even within a tough market environment similar to the one we were experiencing at the time. As a result of the actions we have taken, for the full year 2010, as you can see on Slide 5, we generated positive EBITDA that was in excess of our capital requirements for 2010 in the Refining and Supply business. This represents a tremendous improvement versus 2009, when the business experienced significant cash burn.
So while we continue to be pleased with our progress at many of our controllable aspects of our operations, we will continue to maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets and can make the most of the market opportunities that do present themselves. 
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 9. First, let's discuss the Retail, Logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $63 million pretax, $47 million after tax, in the aggregate or in the quarter, as detailed on Slides 4 and 6. 
Retail Marketing earned $1 million pretax and $3 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins were significantly challenged as crude prices and wholesale gasoline prices were on the rise throughout most of the quarter. 
While we experienced a challenging quarter, we earned $176 million pretax for the full year 2010, an improvement of $30 million versus the prior year. We do see volatility in this business quarter-to-quarter, but historical annual results prove that over time, this business delivers strong, consistent results. We saw strong volumes relative to the challenging quarter one year ago.  Gasoline and distillate volumes were up by 1.8% and 7%, respectively, on an open both-year basis. Additionally, we made progress during the quarter in our retail growth strategy, including the acquisition of 25 sites in New York, newer extended agreements to operate sites on the Ohio Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Palisades Parkway and continued growth in the distributor network. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,900 sites carried the Sunoco flag, and this is the business we continue to target for growth.
Turning now to Logistics, which earned $37 million pretax, $23 million after tax in the fourth quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership interest in Sunoco Logistics, which continues to be a reliable source of earnings. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a rateable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist, as was the case in the third quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter. 
The Logistics business also has strong growth opportunities. Sunoco Logistics spent approximately $390 million in expansion capital during 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million excluding major acquisitions and Project Mariner. 
Coke earned $25 million pretax, $21 million after tax in Q4. The Coke business earned $132 million net income after tax for the full year, consistent with the earnings guidance previously provided. Relative to the third quarter, earnings were lower due to spot sales of coke in the third quarter and higher spending in the fourth quarter related to activities around growth and preparation to be a standalone business. Additionally, production issues at our Indiana Harbor plant and arbitration and legal costs impacted fourth quarter results. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted our expectation that we would be able to achieve breakeven cash flow in the Coke business. We are pleased to report that SunCoke generated EBITDA in excess of capital spending and also generated additional cash flow to working capital in 2010. This is a significant accomplishment for the business to operate as a stand-alone business. 
Regarding the separation, now that the Jewell litigation is behind us, Sunoco intends to move forward with the planned separation of SunCoke in a two-step process. Later in the call, Fritz will address the settlement agreement regarding the Jewell plant, outline earning expectations for 2011 and '12 and provide an update on the growth outlook.
Now turning to Refining and Supply.  As shown on Slide 7, refining and Supply had a loss of $17 million pretax or $8 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $227 million pretax or $135 million after tax in the same quarter in 2009. We saw market conditions in the Northeast system improve in the fourth quarter, as reflected in the market margins, but we experienced operational issues which hindered our performance. 
Our systemwide crude unit utilization rate was 85% for the fourth quarter, which is obviously much lower than the optimal rates given the margin environment. The Northeast system was impacted by operational issues, and the Toledo refinery utilization was also negatively impacted by crude oil pipeline allocation limits. 
In the northeast, both refineries experienced mechanical issues late in the quarter for which maintenance work continues into the first quarter of 2011. We expect to complete the maintenance activities in February and return to normal rates in March. As a result of this work, first quarter utilization for the Northeast system is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2010. With respect to our Q4 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 8 and 9 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our systemwide Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the fourth quarter, and margin capture was 78%. While market margins and market capture rates were both significantly improved from the same quarter of last year, our margin capture was challenged by both rising crude prices and our own operational difficulties. Excluding crude timing, which negatively impacted the capture rate for the second consecutive quarter, margin capture was 86%. Our operational issues resulted in lack of rateability, which also had a negative impact on our margin  capture in the midst of the current volatile price environment. 
Even with the difficulties experienced in the fourth quarter, we showed significant improvement in margin capture for the full year 2010 versus 2009. Our improvements can be attributed to better reliability and a successful strategy, matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability and utilization is both in the northeast and Toledo, as we were undergoing turnaround activity in Toledo during late 2009. Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. Specifically in 2010, 36% of our net production was distillate versus 32% in 2009, with the offset being less production of the cheaper residual fuels. Our actions that supported the improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slates and the operations of the new hydrotreater unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we seized opportunities to upgrade more of the distillate to ULSD when it was attractive to do so. Northeast ULSD differentials to heating oil widened by $0.015 a gallon year-over-year. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. We have noted that there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period. Additionally, we recognize that reliability of our refineries is an essential component to strong performance, and the fourth quarter is a demonstration of this. We will remain focused on the fundamentals, those elements within our control, to drive strong performance in whatever environment exists. 
As previously noted, our first quarter utilization is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, due to maintenance work in our northeast system. Accordingly, we expect challenged Refining and Supply results again in the first quarter, given the resulting lower utilization level, along with still-rising crude prices and relatively weaker northeast market conditions evident thus far. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of December. In conjunction with that, I'll direct you to Slides 10 and 11. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics, was a source of approximately $360 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $180 million, excluding SXL. This represents a swing of $1.4 billion from the prior year end, when the Sunoco parent was carrying $1.2 billion of net debt. The cash increase in the quarter was driven by working capital movements as we liquidated inventories related to our Eagle Point refinery, which was shut down in late 2009. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 6% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL. 
At December 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. As seen on Slide 12, our capital spend for 2010, excluding Sunoco Logistics Partners, was $614 million, which included $223 million for Refining and Supply without the gross spending for the Fulton biofuels plant. We were successful in managing capital for this business and reduced our total spend by approximately $75 million versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. This reduction has been achieved primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. We continue to focus on running safe and reliable operations, but we will also continue to limit the discretionary capital that is put into this business. 
As it relates to capital spending expectations for Refining and Supply in 2011, we are currently in discussions with the appropriate government environmental authorities about the requirements of the 2006 Consent Decree as it applies to the Marcus Hook Refinery. As we have previously reported, we have completed projects at the Philadelphia and Toledo refineries under a 2006 Consent Decree. We had expected to make additional capital outlays of approximately $200 million at the Marcus Hook refinery under the same Consent Decree by June 30, 2013. We are hopeful that an outcome of these recent discussions will include an extension of the required timeframe for these capital outlays, thus reducing our capital outlays in 2011 and 2012. This will allow us additional time to explore options that will lower the cost of the total project. If these discussions are successful, and subject to the closing of the Toledo refinery sale, we expect 2011 capital spending in Refining and Supply business to range from $135 million to $145 million, down from 2010 and below DD&A. 
While we are closely managing our capital spend in the Refining and Supply business, we are targeting our Coke, Logistics and Retail businesses for growth opportunities. Our 2011 capital guidance, as shown on Slide 12, includes approximately $165 million to finish the SunCoke Middletown plant, which is expected to be running late in the second half of 2011. We also showed logistics capital spend, including maintenance capital, in the range of $145 million to $195 million, which is expected to be funded by Sunoco Logistics Partners and excludes any potential major acquisitions and Project Mariner spend. 
Lastly, we've continued to pursue growth opportunities in our Retail business. These will be opportunistic and thus are not included in our capital guidance at this time.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility, to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses as well as ride out the challenging and volatile refining environment. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At December 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.1 billion. Now I'll turn the call over to Fritz Henderson, who will provide an update on the SunCoke business."
305749,118107646,99196,"Sunoco, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective Ja",992,"Thanks, Brian. Good evening. First, as noted in our press release earlier this week, we did reach a settlement with regard to the lawsuit filed by ArcelorMittal concerning our coke pricing from our Jewell facility. The settlement agreement is effective January 1 of this year, 2011, and includes the following terms. First, a renegotiation of the Jewell coke contract, including the elimination of what was called the Jewell coal cost multiplier, and an increase in the fees at Jewell. The pricing of Jewell coal will be based upon the third-party coal price at SunCoke's Haverhill facility. Second, a renegotiation and increase in the fees paid under the Haverhill agreement. Third, the take-or-pay basis of both Jewell and Haverhill agreements with ArcelorMittal will be extended through 2020. This extension provides SunCoke a guaranteed outlet for this coke production through 2020, and both of these contracts were previously structured to convert to the basis of ArcelorMittal's U.S. requirement effective October 2012, so we extended the take-or-pay through 2020. 
Finally, in addition to resolving the Jewell litigation, earlier this week, we also negotiated a settlement of arbitration claims related to our supply of coke to ArcelorMittal from our Indiana Harbor site. Costs associated with the settlement were largely accrued in the fourth quarter. Combined with the Jewell settlement, we have now resolved all of our existing material and commercial disputes with ArcelorMittal, allowing us to focus on building a productive dialogue in partnership with our largest customer, including possible extension of the Indiana Harbor contract that expires in 2013. The Indiana Harbor contract is, to date, the only contract that we have not covered by longer-term take-or-pay arrangements. We're pleased to put these matters behind us, but we continue to move forward with our plans to separate the business and unlock shareholder value.
On the operating side of the business, reflecting both operating and capacity issues at our Indiana Harbor facility, we did not deliver to our contractual minimum to 2010. This was the only facility where we missed our minimums in 2010. As the coke was not required, however, there were no shortfall penalties payable by SunCoke. 
With regard to 2011, while we're aggressively pursuing oven reliability repairs and throughput initiatives, we do not expect to be able to restore volumes to the contractual minimums at Indiana Harbor, and as such, we're working with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements in our own facilities. 
Let me take a moment to discuss earnings guidance. Turning to Slide 14. In 2011, SunCoke Energy is expected to earn EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $200 million, based upon our average contracted coal purchase price for 2011 of approximately $165 per ton. As compared to 2010 actual results, earnings in 2011 will be lower due to the revised terms of the Jewell coke contract and higher operating costs related to relocation of the business from Knoxville to Chicago and operation as a standalone company, partially offset by higher coke market prices and higher production related to a full year of Granite City operation and the expected startup of our Middletown operations. 
In 2012, with a full year of Middletown operations and increased coal production from our expansion, we expect EBITDA to range from $280 million to $320 million. This assumes a coal price of approximately $175 per ton. Coal purchases have not yet been contracted for 2012. They wouldn't expect them to be contracted forward until late in 2011, but at $175, these are well below where we see coal prices in the spot markets today. 
The net income guidance shown on the chart flows from the EBITDA levels but does not include any interest expense associated with the yet-to-be-determined capital structure for SunCoke.
As Slide 15 reflects, we continue to work towards preparing SunCoke for successful operation as a standalone entity, including preparing for the relocation of our headquarters to Chicago and hiring key leadership. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we saw once again in the most recent steel downturn, long-term take-or-pay agreements provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through this most recent period, for example. Looking forward, beyond the stable base of our existing contracts, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and in coal.  Specifically, in the U.S., we're seeing demand for additional coke supply from multiple customers. When combined with our desire to introduce a small amount of merchant capacity into our coke battery fleet, we see an opportunity to build at least one more U.S. coke plant, with the potential to be larger than our traditional coking batteries. And here, I'm referring to our batteries at Haverhill 1 and 2 as well as our Granite City facility. These facilities typically have between 550,000 and 600,000 tons per year capacity. 
In coal, we're expanding capacity in our existing Jewell metallurgical coal mine, increasing production from 1.2 million tons per year to approximately 1.7 million tons per year by the end of 2012 on an annualized basis. We also recently completed the acquisition of Harold Keene Coal, which will take our production to an estimated 2 million tons per year by the end of 2012. Reflected in the elimination of the Jewell multiplier, but also the expansion of our coal production, our price sensitivity to coal is expected to be plus or minus $20 million in pretax earnings for every $10-per-ton movement in coal prices, again on the running rate basis, by the end of 2012.
Internationally, we see opportunity to expand and grow our footprint, most likely through ventures and/or alliances in India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and China, something we are prioritizing in 2011. Let me turn it back to Lynn to close the call."

We talked about, when I went through the presentation -- basically, when you look at the sensitivity to coal prices, once you get to 2 million tons, the sensitivity is 2 million x $10. So it's plus or minus $20 million of pretax profit for every $10 movement in the price of coal. Because you would hold, at that point, your production cost constant, and all you're doing is guaranteeing the price. So your first question on where coal prices are today. First of all, not a lot of trading in the spot market. The primary source of spot coal, met coal, in the world is Australia, and Australia's being hit by both the flood impact as well as now the cyclone impact. If you had to go out and purchase spot met coal today, it's -- in our best judgment, it's well above $200 a ton today. And it's really not readily available, given what's happened. Most coal is contracted for on a long-term basis, though. But it's pretty clear [indiscernible] a lot that -- the combination of continued demand growth in China, continued demand growth in India for met coal, combined with a reasonable outlook in the U.S and in Brazil -- I mean, I think that when you look at the symmetry, if you will, of coal prices, we think at $175, we have a reasonable planning assumption for 2012. Obviously, we won't know that until we get later into 2012, but based upon what I know, it feels like a pretty reasonable assumption for us to make."

We should get some added benefit from that -- well, first of all, in the fixes we've done, we also modified a calcium removal system that should prevent us from running into the same problem going forward, and that was happening mostly as a result of the Doba that we had been running there.

If I go, then, into sort of late December and into the first quarter, we had problems at Philadelphia due to a leak in an overhead crude line that we feel we need to shut down the unit to do a repair. And so that will be done concurrently with repairing a mechanical issue to a key pressure control valve on the cat cracker at Philadelphia. And we've been running at reduced rates, both on the crude and the cat cracker, to deal with both of these issues until we shut down, which we'd do in February and would expect to be back up in March. And then at Marcus Hook, we had an unplanned reformer catalyst regeneration, and when we took the reformer down, we had to reduce rates at the cat cracker in order to contain process stocks. And we took the opportunity then to bring forward some work that had been planned for later, so the good news is that we've got some work that would would've been done later in the year, planned for later in the year, out of the way.

And the offtakes tend to be the most stable in our branded Retail channel. And so to the extent that we can continue to grow the branded retail and use that as a way to pull volume, then we have a much, much better chance of optimizing the hydrocarbon and running, in a sense, in a more stable and ratable way, which, in turn, makes it easier to be reliable. So I think that there is a benefit to having the full chain in that regard. If you've got those refineries, then we've got to get the most out of them that we possibly can. I think the other piece of it is, is that to the extent that there are options in the marketplace for tourmaline in a pipeline, obviously the more that we can pull volume through our own SXL facility, the better off that we are. So that's essentially the other piece of the equation."

I think it's better for us. There are merchant coke suppliers in these markets that we could affiliate with. There are new projects being built, and, yes, they do pose interesting opportunities for us. But part of the work is, first, what's the right partner?

Welcome to the Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's first quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. John Pickering, he was recently appointed our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, is in the room with us and on the line is Rick Henderson, who will be Chairman and CEO of SunCoke Energy upon separation. 
I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. As part of today's call, I will direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. 
Now, let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3 and 4, we reported a net loss of $122 million excluding special items or $1.01 per share. When I look at our performance in the first quarter, I see three things. First, operational reliability remains a significant area of focus for us as it negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units at our Northeast refineries came down for extended unplanned maintenance. Overall, our refinery utilization for the quarter was 74%, well below our planned rate. Clearly, this situation is not acceptable and we have taken a number of steps, which I'll discuss shortly to both remedy these issues and ensure there are no further disruptions. 
Second, the marketplace continued to be challenging, with rising crude prices putting downward pressure on margins in both refining and retail marketing, which was most apparent in our retail business where the competitive environment made it difficult to quickly pass-through raw material costs. Rising prices also challenged profitability on the refining side, largely due to the pricing lag of our crude purchases. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. We recently announced the filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that proposed IPO as stock of SunCoke Energy. Our project to expand the West Texas Coke pipeline, which is 50% owned by Sunoco Logistics to increase crude output capacity from the Permian Basin, the expansion of Sunoco Logistics Project Mariner to move ethane from the Marcellus Shale region to markets in Canada in addition to the initial destination in the Gulf Coast and other international market. The closing of the sales of Toledo refinery and continued expansion of our retail network, including the start of a long-term contract to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway. These various actions show that we continue to unlock value for Sunoco's shareholders by investing in underperforming and non-core business segments, as well as growing Retail and Logistics. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, we have considerable strategic flexibility to pursue growth. 
Before I discuss the individual units, let me say a few words about our focus on improving the overall reliability, competitiveness of our refinery. I'll spend a few minutes addressing issues that we encountered during the quarter and some resolutions and mitigations we are working on as we speak. There were two significant operational issues at Marcus Hook, one related to accelerating the activation of the NAFTA catalysts that required and unscheduled catalyst from generation as referenced on the fourth quarter call. The other issue was a total refinery shutdown caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier in late March. The Marcus Hook units affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. 
Philadelphia experienced mechanical failures at the larger of the two catalytic cracker units. Specifically, these failures include a damaged fuel gas control valve, blockage of reactor cyclones due to coke and a crack in an expansion joint cost by the up-and-down pricing of the unit over time. Additionally, the Bakken flasher of the largest crude unit experienced erosion that necessitated a shutdown to address. Our analysis has sen that almost all of the issues in Philadelphia can be traced back to significant changes made with substantial money spent as part of capital projects and maintenance turnarounds that occurred during the 2007 through 2009 timeframe. There were secondary impacts created by these changes that were not anticipated during the initial design and execution. In addition to addressing mechanical failures, we are reviewing all the major changes made in recent years at both refineries to identify any other areas where secondary impacts may not have been fully understood so that we can address them on a proactive basis. We also took the opportunity during our downtime this year to perform additional work on improving reliability and efficiency of our units. The maintenance work in Philadelphia extended to the third week in April. Our maintenance activities are now complete and all units are currently up and running through the extensive maintenance work. Our refining segment remains focused on the fundamentals. Operating reliably and safely, improving margin capture and lowering our break even cost per barrel. 
In retail, we are working to grow the strong Sunoco brand that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-over-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at retail, we expect our brand to pull volume through our invested network of refineries, logistics and service stations. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue integrating recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities. The recently announced projects mentioned earlier demonstrate that we are executing organic growth opportunities that add value. The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing it to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission represents a real step forward. We also have an exceptional and experienced management team in place and we expect to complete the relocation of SunCoke's corporate headquarters to the Chicago area in mid-May. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included a $51 million pretax of net favorable spe",1901,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included a $51 million pretax of net favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the divestment of the Toledo refinery and related inventory and also the reduction of crude oil and refined product inventories at the Toledo refinery prior to the divestment. Excluding the impact of special items, the effective tax rate on pretax income attributable to Sunoco shareholders for the first quarter of 2011 was 13%. The effective tax rate was determined based upon the expected full year tax rate at the end of the quarter. The lower tax rate relative to prior quarters is largely attributable to the estimated impact of nonconventional coke tax credits and higher coke depletion deductions combined with lower pretax earnings given our Q1 performance. We delivered another strong quarter in our logistics business. In the Coke business, we recognized losses related to our Indiana Harbor operating issues and expected production shortfalls for the year. But at this time, we reaffirm our previously reported 2011 full year guidance for that business. In our retail business, we were successful in maintaining positive earnings even with the continued challenging market conditions as absolute crude prices continued on price. Climbing crude prices also negatively impacted our refining and supplier results as did the operational issues at our northeast refining system previously discussed by Lynn. 
Regarding Q1 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7. First, let's discuss the retail logistics and coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $52 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slides 4 and 5. Retail Marketing, in particular, earned $12 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins were challenged as wholesale gasoline prices rose $0.54 a gallon during the quarter, the sharpest quarterly rise that we have record of within our markets. Despite his headwind, we were able to achieve average gasoline margins of $0.069 per gallon for the quarter. Gasoline volumes in the first quarter were largely flat to the same quarter last year on an open book years basis, while volumes were up approximately 12%, also on an open both years basis, reflecting the relatively better business environment versus last year. Overall, gasoline volumes were up about 6% in the first quarter versus the prior year due to new sites that we have added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within the distributor network. In the second quarter, as gasoline prices hovered at near record highs, we are concerned with the potential for demand destruction as we are seeing lower throughput volumes year-over-year. Convenience store sales are also impacted by high gasoline prices due to pressure on discretionary spending, further magnified by continued high unemployment in the traditional c-store customer demographics. 
Now, turning to logistics. Logistics earned $31 million pretax in the first quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics Partners, which continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earnings. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by earnings from the 2010 acquisitions, including the Texon butane blending business and the additional equity interest in the West Texas Gulf and mid-valley pipelines, as well as higher lease acquisition earnings. These positive factors were partially offset by lower throughputs in refined product pipelines related to maintenance activities in the Sunoco Northeast system. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil, market opportunities when contango market structures exist. The logistics business continues have strong growth opportunities. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding major acquisitions, Project Mariner and the West Texas Gulf pipeline expansion. 
Now, turning to coke. Coke earned $9 million pretax in Q1. In the first quarter, we were impacted by cost of approximately $25 million at our Indiana Harbor facility, which includes cost of purchased coke from third parties to cover the projected 2011 contract shortfall. Nevertheless, we are reaffirming our full year guidance in 2011 of after-tax net income between $90 million and $115 million and EBITDA in the range of $165 million and $200 million. We expect the 2011 earnings to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year due largely to onetime cost that occurred in the first half of the year related to the cost of coke purchases to cover expected shortfalls at Indiana Harbor, as well as headquartered relocation costs. As shown on Slide 4, now turning to Refining and Supply, Refining and Supply had a loss of $138 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of $70 million pretax in the same quarter of 2010. In summary, our results in this segment were significantly impacted by reliability issues in the Northeast as Lynn previously discussed. Our systemwide utilization was just 74%, which is clearly much lower than optimal rates. Our plants must run relatively at a higher utilization in order to be profitable. With such low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed cost and our margin capture suffers as well due to suboptimal product slate and product purchases required to meet contractual the requirements. 
With respect to our Q1 margin, margin realizations, I'll refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. As you can see on Slide 6, our systemwide refinery and supply benchmark averaged $6.71 per barrel for the first quarter and margin capture was 47%. Our reliability issues severely hampered our margin realization due to suboptimal production, lack of ratability and the purchase of significant volumes of products throughout the quarter to meet contractual requirements. Market conditions in the Northeast system were also challenging as the rising crude prices negatively impacted results by approximately $40 million or $1 per barrel due to timing lag in our crude pricing. Our Toledo refinery benefit from a strong market in January and February as substantially discounted midcontinent crude provided less to product margins. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we're approaching the market, in order to generate value from these refining assets. We will remain focused on the fundamentals. As Lynn noted, while much of April was still operating at reduced utilization rates due to the completion of maintenance in the Northeast, we have now returned to normal operations and are running at optimal rates in the current environment. In wrapping up our reporting segments, our chemical business reported a pretax loss of $9 million for the first quarter as chemical operations at the Frankfurt plant were limited by reduced doing feedstock from the Philadelphia refinery due to the unplanned downtime this quarter. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of March. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL, was a cash use of approximately $1 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $165 million, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with net debt to capital of negative 6% at the Sunoco level, again excluding SXL. Cash was largely flat to the end of Q4 as net proceeds received during the quarter related to this Toledo refinery sale of approximately $200 million were offset by capital spending. We also received proceeds for the crude inventory going in the first quarter that were largely offset by the corresponding crude payable. Additional proceeds of approximately $300 million for refined product inventory sold at Toledo refinery are expected in the second quarter. Cash payments spread out over the balance of the year related to the sale of a refinery and related working capital are expected to be approximately $175 million. Excluding the impact of the Toledo sale, cash flows from working capital were negatively impacted due to the higher crude inventories at quarter end attributable to the unplanned maintenance during the quarter. But this was largely offset by higher prices at crude payables. 
In addition to the cash proceeds expected in the second quarter for the Toledo refined product inventory, we also expect the working capital build for the Northeast system to substantially unwind in Q2. Second quarter cash flow activity will also include the repayment of $177 million of debt that was paid off on April 1. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available, committed borrowing capacity as of November, excluding SXL. As it relates to capital spending expectations for 2011, our estimates are unchanged from prior guidance. As we look forward to 2011, we continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities for growth, businesses, well as write off the challenging and volatile refining environment. Our final balance sheet note related to inventory. At March 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories LIFO exceeds the carrying value by $3.3 billion. 
Slide 10, now turning to a SunCoke update, as Slide 10 reflects, we have continued to make substantial progress on the separation of SunCoke and the preparation of that business for successful operation as a standalone company. We filed a registration statement with the SEC on March 23 for proposed public IPO of the SunCoke common stock. Subsequent to the completion of the purpose offering, Sunoco intends to distribute the balance of its SunCoke Energy shares to Sunoco shareholders by means of a spinoff that is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition to making progress on the separation of SunCoke, we expect the relocation of SunCoke's headquarters to Chicago to occur in mid-May and have in place and now a strong management team that will be responsible for leading the separated company. While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. Within the Coke business, our existing long-term take or pay contracts provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through the most recent downturn, for example. Looking forward, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and coal. During the first quarter, we acquired the Harold Keene coal company and its affiliated entities. The acquisition significantly increased SunCoke's coal reserves, which bolsters the value proposition we offer to customers. We are also in the early stages of permitting an up to 200 oven facility, which equates to 1.1 million tons of coking capacity in Kentucky and are assessing alternative sites in other states. As previously mentioned, this new project can serve multiple customers and we may also reserve a portion of the capacity for uncommitted Coke sales to the market. With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines for any questions you have."

And about half of that, about $13 million had to do with the cover cost associated with covering. And we made the decision to cover the possible shortfall for the entire year in this quarter and then the contracts we lock in will report the loss. And then the other $12 million will relate to both yield losses as well as higher oven repair and maintenance costs. So it's a combination of three things. As we look into April and May, what happened is our yields have begun to improve, our production volumes are improving, we have more ovens in production. So we have a substantial amount of production in the first quarter. We feel, as we look into the second quarter, certainly look into April and May, we've seen significantly better levels of production. So we're quite confident that the maintenance work we're doing is actually bringing the ovens back up to where they need to be first. Second, that our yields are improving accordingly. Our maintenance cost is still higher than what we want them to be but of the three things, two of them we think we have substantially put behind us. So when we developed the guidance, we developed the guidance assuming we would have some amount of cover. The cover, the costs that we incurred was a little higher than we originally expected but it was not so far out of the range. And sitting here operationally, we feel like we can operate at or near the minimum for the rest of the year at Indiana Harbor. So a lot of work was done. When we had ovens coming out, we actually kept them down and did the fixes on all parts of the oven. So we actually had a lot of ovens out for a period of time than we would otherwise had in the past in order to complete as much repair as possible. That's where we are in the Indiana Harbor."

That's one component of the sale that was also a sale of the accrued which took place in Q1 and it was $200 million of cash that we received in Q1. Also on the face of the balance sheet, you'll see a $200 million long-term note from PDF which is related to the other $200 million from the sale of a refinery. When we referenced the taxes, the taxes are the cash taxes that would be paid throughout the year for all of the ins and outs of the Toledo transaction. So the sale of the physical assets, the sale of the crude, the sale of the products. So it's the total picture in terms of the cash taxes. Your last question related to the dividends from SunCoke, there will be as part of the separation of the coke company from Sunoco, there will be a dividend to the parent. We haven't disclosed the size of that dividend yet or capital structure. It isn't necessarily normative at this stage in the process. But there will be a dividend from SunCoke to Sunoco. And I think your last question was around a buyback and at this time, we have cash, which we've been building from the actions we've been taking. Priority for that cash are to invest in growth in the retail business and the logistics business, as well as to have some cash on hand. As you saw from our Q1 performance, so there can still be a reasonable amount of volatility with our refining assets, even the ones that remain. And then, the last use of potential cash is a potential delevering of the gross debt of the parent company. And so in the short term, those are our cash priorities. Obviously, there's a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet and as we go through these other actions, potentially more calming and we'll have to evaluate that as it happens."

Brian said it well. If you look at a company, once Middletown comes up with 5.9 million tons of capacity and all of it, 100% take or pay, you think about another 1.1 million tons into that fleet of batteries that could take you through 7 million tons. If we were to reserve -- I mean this is hypothetical, we don't have a plan for this but if you were to reserve 200,000 or 300,000 tons of capacity within that new plant, we would have, at that point 3% of our 3% to 4% of total aggregate capacity available for merchant Coke, which is actually quite modest, number one. Number two, situations like we found in Indiana Harbor, not having any ability to actually backdoor our operations when in fact you have a shortfall. We've seen it's not an optimal situation to be in. Now that we expect to be in that situation. Most importantly, if we had 100,000 or 150,000 tons of capacity that we could sell into the merchant markets when markets are good, such as today or such as what we've seen in the past, the profit opportunity associated with have a small amount of capacity is very attractive. Then finally, it turns out the capabilities is such that we're quite confident that we can actually have a small amount of merchant capacity in the new plant without jeopardizing the asset. So I guess it has to do with what Brian said the maturity of the operation, number one. And then number two, the aggregate amount of capacity we have. And then number three, the profit opportunity that would come with having a small amount of capacity available to sell into the market when folks are in short supply."

So in and of itself, substantial improvement in the second quarter in Indiana Harbor. Second thing that happens in the second quarter and actually typically in the third quarter is yields continue to improve. I must say it's been a very wet first quarter. And it's affected moisture, it's affected yields actually, not just in Indiana Harbor but it affected yields at all of our Coke batteries and we're seeing some improvement already in May. You would expect certainly by the third quarter things are drier, your yields improve. Third is that we will have relocation costs in the second quarter, which will be to some degree an offset. We included this, we developed our guidance, the estimates that we provided in the S-1 for that were about, I think it was $11 million to $14 million. Those costs will largely be incurred in the second quarter of separation. Basically it's a severance cost, move cost and the cost of subletting our space in Knoxville. Those are going to occur in the third or fourth quarter. So you've got Indiana Harbor improvement, number one, which actually you begin to see in the second quarter. You have yield improvement across all of the fleet in the second and the third quarter and you've got the relocation, which will occur in the second quarter, which then doesn't occur in the third and fourth. Finally, when you get to the fourth quarter, you've got both Middletown starting up in the fourth quarter, which is what our expected start up is, number one. Number two, you have Coke. We had some roll off of coal. We had some coal contracts that carried over into the first quarter. You get into the second quarter and the third quarter, we get coal at $165 a ton. And then finally, we have our preferred dividend timing, which typically in Brazil was in the fourth quarter. So there is a pretty significant progression through the year."

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's first quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon.

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's first quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. John Pickering, who was recently appointed Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, is in the room with us and on the line is Rick Henderson, who will be Chairman and CEO of SunCoke Energy upon separation. 
I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and as included in this afternoon's earnings release. 
Now let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3 and 4, we reported a net loss of $122 million excluding special items or $1.01 per share. When I look at our performance in the first quarter, I see three things. First, operational reliability remains a significant area of focus for us as it negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units at our Northeast refineries came down for extended unplanned maintenance. Overall, our refinery utilization for the quarter was 74%, well below our planned rate. Clearly, this situation is not acceptable and we have taken a number of steps, which I'll discuss shortly to both remedy these issues and ensure there are no further disruptions. 
Second, the marketplace continued to be challenging, with rising crude prices putting downward pressure on margins in both refining and retail marketing, which was most apparent in our retail business where the competitive environment made it difficult to quickly pass-through raw material cost. Rising prices also challenged profitability on the refining side, largely due to the pricing lag of our crude purchases. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. We recently announced the filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the proposed IPO and stock of SunCoke Energy. Our project to expand the West Texas Gulf Pipeline, which is 50% owned by Sunoco Logistics to increase crude output capacity from the Permian Basin, the expansion of Sunoco Logistics Project Mariner to move ethane from the Marcellus Shale region to markets in Canada in addition to the initial destination in the Gulf Coast and other international markets. The closing of the sales of Toledo refinery and continued expansion of our retail network, including the start of a long-term contract to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway. 
These various actions show that we continue to unlock value for Sunoco's shareholders by divesting of underperforming and non-core business segments, as well as growing Retail and Logistics. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, we have considerable strategic flexibility to pursue growth. 
Before I discuss the individual units, let me say a few words about our focus on improving the overall reliability, competitiveness of our refinery. I'll spend a few minutes addressing issues that we encountered during the quarter and some resolutions and mitigations we are working on as we speak. There were two significant operational issues at Marcus Hook, one related to accelerated deactivation of the naphtha reforming catalyst that required an unscheduled catalyst regeneration as referenced on the fourth quarter call. The other issue is a total refinery shutdown caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier in late March. The Marcus Hook units affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. 
Philadelphia experienced mechanical failures at the larger of the two catalytic cracker units. Specifically, these failures include a damaged fluid gas control valve, blockage of reactor cyclones due to coke and a crack in an expansion joint caused by the up-and-down pricing of the unit over time. Additionally, the backing flasher of the largest crew unit experienced corrosion that necessitated a shutdown to address. Our analysis has shown that almost all of the issues in Philadelphia can be traced back to significant changes made with substantial money spent as part of capital projects and maintenance turnarounds that occurred during the 2007 through 2009 timeframe. There were secondary impacts created by these changes that were not anticipated during the initial design and execution. In addition to addressing mechanical failures, we are reviewing all the major changes made in recent years at both refineries to identify any other areas where secondary impacts may not have been fully understood so that we can address them on a proactive basis. 
We also took the opportunity during our downtime this year to perform additional work on improving reliability and efficiency of our units. The maintenance work in Philadelphia extended to the third week in April. Our maintenance activities are now complete and all units are currently up and running to plan through the extensive maintenance work. Our refining segment remains focused on the fundamental. Operating reliably and safely, improving margin capture and lowering our break even cost per barrel. 
In retail, we are working to grow the strong Sunoco brand that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-over-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at retail, we expect our brand to pull volume through our invested network of refineries, logistics and service stations. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue integrating recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities. The recently announced projects mentioned earlier demonstrate that we are executing organic growth opportunities that add value. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing it to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission represents a real step forward. We also have an exceptional and experienced management team in place and we expect to complete the relocation of SunCoke's corporate headquarters to the Chicago area in mid-May. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
305749,129777436,123315,"Sunoco, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn.

We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $51 million pretax of net favorable speci",1903,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $51 million pretax of net favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the divestment of the Toledo refinery and related inventory and also the reduction of crude oil and refined product inventories at the Toledo refinery prior to the divestment. Excluding the impact of special items, the effective tax rate on pretax income attributable to Sunoco shareholders for the first quarter of 2011 was 13%. The effective tax rate was determined based upon the expected full year tax rate at the end of the quarter. The lower tax rate relative to prior quarters is largely attributable to the estimated impact of nonconventional coke tax credits and higher coke depletion deductions combined with lower pretax earnings given our Q1 performance. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our logistics business. In the Coke business, we recognized losses related to our Indiana Harbor operating issues and expected production shortfalls for the year. But at this time, we reaffirm our previously reported 2011 full year guidance for that business. In our Retail business, we were successful in maintaining positive earnings even with the continued challenging market conditions as absolute crude prices continued on their steep rise. Climbing crude prices also negatively impacted our refining and supplier results as did the operational issues at our northeast refining system previously discussed by Lynn.
Regarding Q1 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7. First, let's discuss the Retail Logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $52 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slides 4 and 5. Retail Marketing, in particular, earned $12 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins were challenged as wholesale gasoline prices rose $0.54 a gallon during the quarter, the sharpest quarterly rise that we have record of within our markets. Despite his headwind, we were able to achieve average gasoline margins of $0.069 per gallon for the quarter. 
Gasoline volumes in the first quarter were largely flat to the same quarter last year on an open both year's basis, while distillate volumes were up approximately 12%, also on an open both years basis, reflecting the relatively better business environment versus last year. Overall, gasoline volumes were up about 6% in the first quarter versus the prior year due to new sites that we have added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within the distributor network. 
In the second quarter, as gasoline prices hover at near record highs, we are concerned with the potential for demand destruction as we are seeing lower throughput volumes year-over-year. Convenience store sales are also impacted by high gasoline prices due to pressure on discretionary spending, further magnified by continued high unemployment in the traditional c-store customer demographics. 
Now, turning to logistics. Logistics earned $31 million pretax in the first quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics Partners, which continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earnings. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by earnings from the 2010 acquisition, including the Texon Butane Blending business and the additional equity interest in the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipelines, as well as higher lease acquisition earnings. These positive factors were partially offset by lower throughputs in refined product pipelines related to maintenance activities in the Sunoco Northeast system. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil, market opportunities when contango market structures exist. 
The Logistics business continues to have strong growth opportunities. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding major acquisitions, Project Mariner and the West Texas Gulf Pipeline expansion. 
Now, turning to Coke. Coke earned $9 million pretax in Q1. In the first quarter, we were impacted by cost of approximately $25 million at our Indiana Harbor facility, which includes cost of purchased coke from third parties to cover the projected 2011 contract shortfall. Nevertheless, we are reaffirming our full year guidance in 2011 of after-tax net income between $90 million and $115 million and EBITDA in the range of $165 million and $200 million. We expect the 2011 earnings to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year due largely to onetime cost that occurred in the first half of the year related to the cost of coke purchases to cover expected shortfalls at Indiana Harbor, as well as headquarter relocation cost. 
As shown on Slide 4, now turning to Refining and Supply, Refining and Supply had a loss of $138 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of $70 million pretax in the same quarter of 2010. In summary, our results in this segment were significantly impacted by reliability issues in the Northeast as Lynn previously discussed. Our systemwide utilization was just 74%, which is clearly much lower than optimal rates. Our plants must run reliably with high utilization in order to be profitable. With such a low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed cost and our market capture suffers as well due to suboptimal product slate and product purchases required to meet contractual the requirements. 
With respect to our Q1 margin realizations, I'll refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. As you can see on Slide 6, our systemwide refining and supply benchmark averaged $6.71 per barrel for the first quarter and margin capture was 47%. Our reliability issues severely hampered our margin realization due to suboptimal production, lack of ratability and the purchase of significant volumes of product throughout the quarter to meet contractual requirements. 
Market conditions in the Northeast system were also challenging as the rising crude prices negatively impacted results by approximately $40 million or $1 per barrel due to timing lag in our crude pricing. Our Toledo refinery benefit from a strong market in January and February a substantially discounted Mid-Continent crude provided lift to product margins. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we're approaching the market, in order to generate value from these refining assets. We will remain focused on the fundamentals. As Lynn noted, while much of April was still operating at reduced utilization rates due to the completion of maintenance in the Northeast, we've now returned to normal operations and are running at optimal rates in the current environment. 
In wrapping up our reporting segments, our Chemical business reported a pretax loss of $9 million for the first quarter as Chemical operations at the Frankfurt plant were limited by reduced cuming feedstock [ph] (23:56) from the Philadelphia refinery due to the unplanned downtime this quarter. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of March. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL, was a cash use of approximately $1 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $165 million, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with net debt to capital of negative 6% at the Sunoco level, again excluding SXL. 
Cash was largely flat to the end of Q4 as net proceeds received during the quarter related to this Toledo refinery sale of approximately $200 million were offset by capital spending. We also received proceeds for the crude inventory going in the first quarter that were largely offset by the corresponding crude payable. Additional proceeds of approximately $300 million for refined product inventory sold at the Toledo refinery are expected in the second quarter. Cash payments spread out over the balance of the year related to the sale of the refinery and related working capital are expected to be approximately $175 million. Excluding the impact of the Toledo sale, cash flows from working capital were negatively impacted due to higher crude inventories at quarter end attributable to the unplanned maintenance during the quarter. But this was largely offset by higher prices at crude payables.
In addition to the cash proceeds expected in the second quarter for the Toledo refined product inventory, we also expect the working capital build for the Northeast system to substantially unwind in Q2. Second quarter cash flow activity will also include the repayment of $177 million of debt that was paid off on April 1. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available, committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. As it relates to capital spending expectations for 2011, our estimates are unchanged from prior guidance. 
As we look forward to 2011, we continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities for growth, businesses, as well as write off the challenging and volatile refining environment. A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At March 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories value at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.3 billion. 
Slide 10, now turning to a SunCoke update, as Slide 10 reflects, we have continued to make substantial progress on the separation of SunCoke and the preparation of that business for successful operation as a standalone company. We filed a registration statement with the SEC on March 23 for proposed public IPO of the SunCoke common stock. Subsequent to the completion of the proposed offering, Sunoco intends to distribute the balance of its SunCoke Energy shares to Sunoco shareholders by means of a spinoff that is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition to making progress on the separation of SunCoke, we expect the relocation of SunCoke's headquarters to Chicago to occur in mid-May and have in place now a strong management team that will be physically responsible for leading the separated company. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. Within the Coke business, our existing long-term take-or-pay contracts provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through the most recent downturn, for example. Looking forward, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and coal. During the first quarter, we acquired the Harold Keene Coal company and its affiliated entities. The acquisition significantly increased SunCoke's coal reserves, which bolsters the value proposition we offer to customers. 
We are also in the early stages of permitting an up to 200-oven facility, which equates to 1.1 million tons of coking capacity in Kentucky and are assessing alternative sites in other states. As previously mentioned, this new project could serve multiple customers and we may also reserve a portion of the capacity for uncommitted Coke sales to the market. With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines for any questions you have."

First, the impact, as Brian mentioned in the first quarter, was about $25 million associated at Indiana Harbor. And about half of that, about $13 million, had to do with the cover cost associated with covering. And we made the decision to cover the possible shortfall for the entire year in the first quarter. And then, since the contracts we're locked in, we reported a loss. And then the other $12 million relate to both yield losses as well as a higher oven repair and maintenance cost. So it's a combination of three things. As we look into April and May, what happened is our yields have begun to improve, our production volumes are improving, we have more ovens in production. So we had a substantial amount of lot production in the first quarter. We feel, as we look into the second quarter, certainly look into April and May, we've seen significantly better levels of production. So we're quite confident that the maintenance work we're doing is actually bringing the ovens back up to where they need to be, first. Second, that our yields are improving accordingly. Our maintenance cost are still higher than we want them to be. But of the three things, two of them, we think we have substantially put behind us. So when we developed the guidance, we developed the guidance assuming we would have some amount of cover. The cover, the cost that we incurred was a little higher than we had originally expected but it was not so far out of the range. And sitting here operationally, we feel like we can operate at or near the minimum for the rest of the year at Indiana Harbor. So a lot of work was done. When we had ovens coming out, we actually kept them down and did the fixes on all parts of the oven. So we actually had a lot of ovens out for a more extended period of time than we would have otherwise had in the past in order to complete as much repair as possible. That's where we are in the Indiana Harbor."

As you'll see on the face of the balance sheet, we have a receivable from the sale of the Toledo refinery of $285 million, and that's related to the product inventory that we sold. That's one component of the sale that was also a sale of the accrued, which took place in Q1, and it was $200 million of cash that we received in Q1. Also, on the face of the balance sheet, you'll see a $200 million long-term note from PBF, which is related to the other $200 million from the sale of the refinery. When we referenced the taxes, the taxes are the cash taxes that would be paid throughout the year for all of the ins and outs of the Toledo transaction. So the sale of the physical assets, the sale of the crude, the sale of the products. So it's the total picture in terms of the cash taxes. Your last question related to a dividend from SunCoke. There will be -- as part of the separation of the Coke Company from Sunoco, there will be a dividend to the parent. We haven't disclosed the size of that dividend yet or capital structure. It isn't necessarily normative at this stage in the process. But there will be a dividend from SunCoke to Sunoco. And I think your last question was around a buyback, and at this time, we have cash, which we've been building from the actions we've been taking. Our priorities for that cash are to invest in growth in the Retail business and the Logistics business as well as to have some cash on hand, as you saw from our Q1 performance. So there can still be a reasonable amount of volatility with our refining assets, even the ones that remain. And then the last use of potential cash is a potential delevering of the gross debt of the parent company. And so in the short term, those are our cash priorities. Obviously, there's a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet. And as we go through these, other actions, potentially more coming, and we'll have to evaluate that as it happens."

If we were to reserve -- I mean, this is hypothetical, we don't have a plan for this, but if you were to reserve 200,000 or 300,000 tons of capacity within that new plant, we would have at that point 3% of our 3% to 4% of our total aggregate capacity available for our merchant Coke, which is actually quite modest, number one. Number two, situations like we found in Indiana Harbor, not having any ability to actually backdoor our operations when in fact you have a shortfall, I mean, we've seen it's not an optimum situation to be in and not to do we expect to be in that situation. Most importantly, if we had 100,000 or 150,000 tons of capacity that we could sell into the merchant market when markets are good, such as today or such as what we've seen in the past, the profit opportunity associated with having a small amount of capacity is very attractive. And then finally, it turns out that the capabilities that were out is as such that we're quite confident that we could actually have a small amount of merchant capacity in the new plant without jeopardizing the asset. So I guess it has to do with what Brian said with the maturity of the operation, number one; and then number two, the aggregate amount of capacity we have; and then number three, the profit opportunity that would come with having a small amount of capacity available to sell into the market when Coke is in short supply."

You would expect certainly by the third quarter things are drier, your yields improve. Third is that we will have relocation cost in the second quarter, which will be to some degree an offset. We included these, we developed our guidance, the estimates that we provided in the S-1 for that were about, I think it was $11 million to $14 million.

So you've got Indiana Harbor improvement, number one, which actually you'd begin to see in a subsequent way in the second quarter; you have yield improvement across all of the fleet in the second and the third quarter; and you've got the relocation, which will occur in the second quarter, which then doesn't occur in the third and fourth; and finally, when you get to the fourth quarter, you've got both Middletown starting up in the fourth quarter, which is what our expected start up is, number one. Number two, you have Coke. We had some roll off of coal. We had some coal contracts that's carried over into the first quarter. Those -- and you get into the second quarter and the third, we get coal at $165 a ton. And then finally, we have our preferred dividend timing, which typically in Brazil was in the fourth quarter. So there is a pretty significant progression through the year."

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's first quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. John Pickering, who was recently appointed Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, is in the room with us and on the line is Rick Henderson, who will be Chairman and CEO of SunCoke Energy upon separation. 
I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and as included in this afternoon's earnings release. 
Now let's begin. As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we reported a net loss of $122 million excluding special items or $1.01 per share. When I look at our performance in the first quarter, I see 3 things. First, operational reliability remains a significant area of focus for us as it negatively impacted results this quarter when processing units at our Northeast refineries came down for extended unplanned maintenance. Overall, our refinery utilization for the quarter was 74%, well below our planned rate. Clearly, this situation is not acceptable and we have taken a number of steps, which I'll discuss shortly to both remedy these issues and ensure there are no further disruptions. 
Second, the marketplace continued to be challenging, with rising crude prices putting downward pressure on margins in both refining and retail marketing, which was most apparent in our retail business where the competitive environment made it difficult to quickly pass-through raw material cost. Rising prices also challenged profitability on the refining side, largely due to the pricing lag of our crude purchases. 
Third, we continue to make progress in executing our strategy. We recently announced the filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the proposed IPO and stock of SunCoke Energy. Our project to expand the West Texas Gulf pipeline, which is 50% owned by Sunoco Logistics to increase crude outflow capacity from the Permian Basin, the expansion of Sunoco Logistics Project Mariner to move ethane from the Marcellus Shale region to markets in Canada in addition to the initial destination in the Gulf Coast and other international markets. The closing of the sales of Toledo refinery and continued expansion of our retail network, including the start of a long-term contract to operate retail locations along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway. 
These various actions show that we continue to unlock value for Sunoco's shareholders by divesting of underperforming and non-core business segments, as well as growing Retail and Logistics. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, we have considerable strategic flexibility to pursue growth. 
Before I discuss the individual units, let me say a few words about our focus on improving the overall reliability, competitiveness of our refinery. I'll spend a few minutes addressing issues that we encountered during the quarter and some resolutions and mitigations we are working on as we speak. There were two significant operational issues at Marcus Hook, one related to accelerated deactivation of the naphtha reforming catalyst that required an unscheduled catalyst regeneration as referenced on the fourth quarter call. The other issue is a total refinery shutdown caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier in late March. The Marcus Hook units affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. 
Philadelphia experienced mechanical failures at the larger of the two catalytic cracker units. Specifically, these failures include a damaged fluid gas control valve, blockage of reactor cyclones due to coke and a crack in an expansion joint caused by the up-and-down flashing of the unit over time. Additionally, the backing flasher of the largest crew unit experienced corrosion that necessitated a shutdown to address. Our analysis has shown that almost all of the issues in Philadelphia can be traced back to significant changes made with substantial money spent as part of capital projects and maintenance turnarounds that occurred during the 2007 through 2009 timeframe. There were secondary impacts created by these changes that were not anticipated during the initial design and execution. In addition to addressing mechanical failures, we are reviewing all the major changes made in recent years at both refineries to identify any other areas where secondary impacts may not have been fully understood so that we can address them on a proactive basis. 
We also took the opportunity during our downtime this year to perform additional work on improving reliability and efficiency of our units. The maintenance work in Philadelphia extended to the third week in April. Our maintenance activities are now complete and all units are currently up and running to plan through the extensive maintenance work. Our refining segment remains focused on the fundamental. Operating reliably and safely, improving margin capture and lowering our break even cost per barrel. 
In retail, we are working to grow the strong Sunoco brand that customers have come to know and trust. This entails improving year-over-year sales for fuel and convenience items. By adding more locations and providing a great customer experience at retail, we expect our brand to pull volume through our invested network of refineries, logistics and service stations. I expect Sunoco Logistics to continue integrating recent acquisitions while looking for additional growth opportunities. The recently announced projects mentioned earlier demonstrate that we are executing organic growth opportunities that add value. 
The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and preparing it to operate independently, remains a top priority. The recent filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission represents a real step forward. We also have an exceptional and experienced management team in place and we expect to complete the relocation of SunCoke's corporate headquarters to the Chicago area in mid-May. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
305749,129777436,123335,"Sunoco, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $51 million pretax of net favorable speci",1900,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a pretax loss of $90 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $51 million pretax of net favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with gains from the divestment of the Toledo refinery and related inventory and also the reduction of crude oil and refined product inventories at the Toledo refinery prior to the divestment. Excluding the impact of special items, the effective tax rate on pretax income attributable to Sunoco shareholders for the first quarter of 2011 was 13%. The effective tax rate was determined based upon the expected full year tax rate at the end of the quarter. The lower tax rate relative to prior quarters is largely attributable to the estimated impact of nonconventional coke tax credits and higher coal depletion deductions combined with lower pretax earnings given our Q1 performance. 
We delivered another strong quarter in our logistics business. In the Coke business, we recognized losses related to our Indiana Harbor operating issues and expected production shortfalls for the year. But at this time, we reaffirm our previously reported 2011 full year guidance for that business. In our Retail business, we were successful in maintaining positive earnings even with the continued challenging market conditions as absolute crude prices continued on their steep rise. Climbing crude prices also negatively impacted our refining and supplier results as did the operational issues at our Northeast refining system previously discussed by Lynn.
Regarding Q1 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7. First, let's discuss the Retail Logistics and Coke segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $52 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slides 4 and 5. Retail Marketing, in particular, earned $12 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins were challenged as wholesale gasoline prices rose $0.54 a gallon during the quarter, the sharpest quarterly rise that we have record of within our markets. Despite his headwind, we were able to achieve average gasoline margins of $0.069 per gallon for the quarter. 
Gasoline volumes in the first quarter were largely flat to the same quarter last year on an open both year's basis, while distillate volumes were up approximately 12%, also on an open both years basis, reflecting the relatively better business environment versus last year. Overall, gasoline volumes were up about 6% in the first quarter versus the prior year due to new sites that we have added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within the distributor network. 
In the second quarter, as gasoline prices hover at near record highs, we are concerned with the potential for demand destruction as we are seeing lower throughput volumes year-over-year. Convenience store sales are also impacted by high gasoline prices due to pressure on discretionary spending, further magnified by continued high unemployment in the traditional c-store customer demographics. 
Now, turning to logistics. Logistics earned $31 million pretax in the first quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics Partners, which continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earnings. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by earnings from the 2010 acquisition, including the Texon Butane Blending business and the additional equity interest in the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipelines, as well as higher lease acquisition earnings. These positive factors were partially offset by lower throughputs in refined product pipelines related to maintenance activities in the Sunoco Northeast system. The throughput and tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil, market opportunities when contango market structures exist. 
The Logistics business continues to have strong growth opportunities. In 2011, Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding major acquisitions, Project Mariner and the West Texas Gulf Pipeline expansion. 
Now, turning to Coke. Coke earned $9 million pretax in Q1. In the first quarter, we were impacted by cost of approximately $25 million at our Indiana Harbor facility, which includes cost of purchased coke from third parties to cover the projected 2011 contract shortfall. Nevertheless, we are reaffirming our full year guidance in 2011 of after-tax net income between $90 million and $115 million and EBITDA in the range of $165 million and $200 million. We expect the 2011 earnings to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year due largely to onetime cost that occurred in the first half of the year related to the cost of coke purchases to cover expected shortfalls at Indiana Harbor, as well as headquarter relocation cost. 
As shown on Slide 4, now turning to Refining and Supply, Refining and Supply had a loss of $138 million pretax in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of $70 million pretax in the same quarter of 2010. In summary, our results in this segment were significantly impacted by reliability issues in the Northeast as Lynn previously discussed. Our systemwide utilization was just 74%, which is clearly much lower than optimal rates. Our plants must run reliably with high utilization in order to be profitable. With such a low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed costs and our market capture suffers as well due to suboptimal product slate and product purchases required to meet contractual the requirements. 
With respect to our Q1 margin realizations, I'll refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on our refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. As you can see on Slide 6, our systemwide refining and supply benchmark averaged $6.71 per barrel for the first quarter and margin capture was 47%. Our reliability issues severely hampered our margin realization due to suboptimal production, lack of ratability and the purchase of significant volumes of product throughout the quarter to meet contractual requirements. 
Market conditions in the Northeast system were also challenging as the rising crude prices negatively impacted results by approximately $40 million or $1 per barrel due to timing lag in our crude pricing. Our Toledo refinery benefit from a strong market in January and February a substantially discounted Mid-Continent crude provided lift to product margins. 
In summary, we still feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we're approaching the market, in order to generate value from these refining assets. We will remain focused on the fundamentals. As Lynn noted, while much of April was still operating at reduced utilization rates due to the completion of maintenance in the Northeast, we've now returned to normal operations and are running at optimal rates in the current environment. 
In wrapping up our reporting segments, our Chemical business reported a pretax loss of $9 million for the first quarter as Chemical operations at the Frankfurt plant were limited by reduced cuming feedstock [ph] from the Philadelphia refinery due to the unplanned downtime this quarter. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of March. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a funds flow perspective, our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL, was a cash use of approximately $1 million. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $165 million, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with net debt to capital of negative 6% at the Sunoco level, again excluding SXL. 
Cash was largely flat to the end of Q4 as net proceeds received during the quarter related to this Toledo refinery sale of approximately $200 million were offset by capital spending. We also received proceeds for the crude inventory going in the first quarter that were largely offset by the corresponding crude payable. Additional proceeds of approximately $300 million for refined product inventory sold at the Toledo refinery are expected in the second quarter. Cash payments spread out over the balance of the year related to the sale of the refinery and related working capital are expected to be approximately $175 million. Excluding the impact of the Toledo sale, cash flows from working capital were negatively impacted due to higher crude inventories at quarter end attributable to the unplanned maintenance during the quarter. But this was largely offset by higher prices at crude payables.
In addition to the cash proceeds expected in the second quarter for the Toledo refined product inventory, we also expect the working capital build for the Northeast system to substantially unwind in Q2. Second quarter cash flow activity will also include the repayment of $177 million of debt that was paid off on April 1. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available, committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. As it relates to capital spending expectations for 2011, our estimates are unchanged from prior guidance. 
As we look forward to 2011, we continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities for growth, businesses, as well as write off the challenging and volatile refining environment. A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At March 31, the current replacement cost of all inventories value at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $3.3 billion. 
Slide 10, now turning to a SunCoke update, as Slide 10 reflects, we have continued to make substantial progress on the separation of SunCoke and the preparation of that business for successful operation as a standalone company. We filed a registration statement with the SEC on March 23 for proposed public IPO of the SunCoke common stock. Subsequent to the completion of the proposed offering, Sunoco intends to distribute the balance of its SunCoke Energy shares to Sunoco shareholders by means of a spinoff that is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition to making progress on the separation of SunCoke, we expect the relocation of SunCoke's headquarters to Chicago to occur in mid-May and have in place now a strong management team that will be responsible for leading the separated company. 
While we prepare for the separation of the SunCoke business, we also continue to actively pursue opportunities for new projects, both in the U.S. and internationally. Within the Coke business, our existing long-term take-or-pay contracts provide a strong measure of stability in our future cash flows, with all of our customers respecting their commitments through the most recent downturn, for example. Looking forward, we continue to see a number of growth opportunities in both coke and coal. During the first quarter, we acquired the Harold Keene Coal company and its affiliated entities. The acquisition significantly increased SunCoke's coal reserves, which bolsters the value proposition we offer customers. 
We are also in the early stages of permitting an up to 200-oven facility, which equates to 1.1 million tons of coking capacity in Kentucky and are assessing alternative sites in other states. As previously mentioned, this new project could serve multiple customers and we may also reserve a portion of the capacity for uncommitted Coke sales to the market. With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines for any questions you have."

First, the impact, as Brian mentioned in the first quarter, was about $25 million associated at Indiana Harbor. And about half of that, about $13 million, had to do with the cover cost associated with covering. And we made the decision to cover the possible shortfall for the entire year in the first quarter. And then, since the contracts we're locked in, we reported a loss. And then the other $12 million relate to both yield losses as well as a higher oven repair and maintenance cost. So it's a combination of three things. As we look into April and May, what's happened is our yields have begun to improve, our production volumes are improving, we have more ovens in production. So we had a substantial amount of lost production in the first quarter. We feel, as we look into the second quarter, certainly look into April and May, we've seen significantly better levels of production. So we're quite confident that the maintenance work we're doing is actually bringing the ovens back up to where they need to be, first. Second, that our yields are improving accordingly. Our maintenance costs are still higher than we want them to be. But of the three things, two of them, we think we have substantially put behind us. So when we developed the guidance, we developed the guidance assuming we would have some amount of cover. The cover, the cost that we incurred was a little higher than we had originally expected but it was not so far out of the range. And sitting here operationally, we feel like we can operate at or near the minimum for the rest of the year at Indiana Harbor. So a lot of work was done. When we had ovens coming out, we actually kept them down and did the fixes on all parts of the oven. So we actually had a lot of ovens out for a more extended period of time than we would have otherwise had in the past in order to complete as much repair as possible. That's where we are in the Indiana Harbor."

That's one component of the sale that was also a sale of the crude, which took place in Q1, and it was $200 million of cash that we received in Q1. Also, on the face of the balance sheet, you'll see a $200 million long-term note from PBF, which is related to the other $200 million from the sale of the refinery. When we referenced the taxes, the taxes are the cash taxes that would be paid throughout the year for all of the ins and outs of the Toledo transaction. So the sale of the physical assets, the sale of the crude, the sale of the products. So it's the total picture in terms of the cash taxes. Your last question related to a dividend from SunCoke. There will be -- as part of the separation of the Coke Company from Sunoco, there will be a dividend to the parent. We haven't disclosed the size of that dividend yet or capital structure. It isn't necessarily normative at this stage in the process. But there will be a dividend from SunCoke to Sunoco. And I think your last question was around a buyback, and at this time, we have cash, which we've been building from the actions we've been taking. Our priorities for that cash are to invest in growth in the Retail business and the Logistics business as well as to have some cash on hand, as you saw from our Q1 performance. So there can still be a reasonable amount of volatility with our refining assets, even the ones that remain. And then the last use of potential cash is a potential delevering of the gross debt of the parent company. And so in the short term, those are our cash priorities. Obviously, there's a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet. And as we go through these, other actions, potentially more coming, and we'll have to evaluate that as it happens."

I mean, if you look at a company with -- once Middletown comes up with a 5.9 million tons of capacity and all of it, 100% take or pay, you think about adding another 1.1 million tons into that fleet of batteries that could take you to 7 million tons? If we were to reserve -- I mean, this is hypothetical, we don't have a plan for this, but if you were to reserve 200,000 or 300,000 tons of capacity within that new plant, we would have at that point 3% of our- 3% to 4% of our total aggregate capacity available for merchant Coke, which is actually quite modest, number one. Number two, situations like we found in Indiana Harbor, not having any ability to actually backdoor our operations when in fact you have a shortfall, I mean, we've seen it's not an optimum situation to be in and not to do we expect to be in that situation. Most importantly, if we had 100,000 or 150,000 tons of capacity that we could sell into the merchant market when markets are good, such as today or such as what we've seen in the past, the profit opportunity associated with having a small amount of capacity is very attractive. And then finally, it turns out that the capabilities of our ovens is as such that we're quite confident that we could actually have a small amount of merchant capacity in the new plant without jeopardizing the asset. So I guess it has to do with what Brian said with the maturity of the operation, number one; and then number two, the aggregate amount of capacity we have; and then number three, the profit opportunity that would come with having a small amount of capacity available to sell into the market when Coke is in short supply."

That included $13 million of cover costs, which will not recur. It also included in that $25 million some cost in yield in Indiana Harbor, which is improving into the second quarter. So in and of itself, a substantial improvement in the second quarter in Indiana Harbor. The second thing that happens in the second quarter and actually typically in the third quarter is yields continue to improve. I must say it's been a very wet first quarter. And it's affected moisture, it's affected yields actually, not just in Indiana Harbor, but affected yields at all of our Coke batteries. And we're seeing some improvement already in May. You would expect certainly by the third quarter things are drier, your yields improve. Third is that we will have relocation cost in the second quarter, which will be to some degree an offset. We included these, we developed our guidance, the estimates that we provided in the S-1 for that were about, I think it was $11 million to $14 million. Those costs will largely be incurred in the second quarter. Of separation, basically, it's a severance cost, move cost and the cost of subletting our space in Knoxville. Those will then recur in the third or the fourth quarter. So you've got Indiana Harbor improvement, number one, which actually you'd begin to see in a substantive way in the second quarter; you have yield improvement across all of the fleet in the second and the third quarter; and you've got the relocation, which will occur in the second quarter, which then doesn't occur in the third and fourth; and finally, when you get to the fourth quarter, you've got both Middletown starting up in the fourth quarter, which is what our expected start up is, number one. Number two, you have coal. We had some roll off of coal. We had some coal contracts that's carried over into the first quarter. Those -- and you get into the second quarter and the third, we get coal at $165 a ton. And then finally, we have our preferred dividend timing, which typically in Brazil was in the fourth quarter.

Thank you and good evening, and welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will discuss the company's second quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; John Pickering, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. 
As part of today's call, I will direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. 
Now, let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $49 million or $0.40 per share. When I look at the performance in the second quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from logistics and retail, the 2 growth areas of our business. Logistics contributed $54 million in pretax income as Sunoco logistics partners generated record quarterly results, driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment, as well as contributions from acquisitions and organic expansions in the past year. The $69 million in pretax income earned in retail was a new record second quarter performance, and resulted from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices, which expanded margins. Second, the importance of reliability in our manufacturing operations cannot be overstated. In Refining and Supply, our ability to take advantage of margin improvement was limited by low utilization stemming from first quarter operational issues that continued into April. As you may recall from last quarter's conference call, there was a total refinery shutdown at markets that occurred in late March, which was caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier. The markets of units affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. At Philadelphia refinery, maintenance work aimed at addressing the reliability and efficiency of our units extended into the third week of April. With these issues resolved, refining and supply was profitable in May and June as crude unit utilization improved to 94% for this 2-month period. Along with safety and reliability, margin capture remains an area of focus for us. 
Third, we continue to make progress in growing key parts of our business. In our logistics segment, we have announced more than $450 million worth of acquisitions year-to-date. Most recently, Sunoco Logistics announced the purchase of a controlling interest in Inland Corporation's pipeline and other assets that serve the Mid-Continent. The purchase of East Boston terminal, the sole service provider for Logan international Airport, the purchase of Eagle Point Tank Farm and related assets from Sunoco, which Sunoco Logistics plans to turn into a major refinery products terminal on the East Coast with import and export capabilities and the purchase of a leased crude business from Texon LP, an acquisition that significantly increases the partnership's position in key oil-producing regions and growing shale areas. 
On the retail side, growth has been more modest but continues nonetheless. In June, we announced the expansion of our retail network into Alabama, with 13 new Sunoco-branded distribution locations. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement to acquire a leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company-operated and include an A Plus convenience store. With these expansions, we have added approximately 215 new retail sites to our network since the beginning of 2010. We also continued to release capital through the divestment of non-core assets. During the second quarter, we announced an agreement to sell our phenol and acetone manufacturing facility in the Frankfurt section of Philadelphia to Honeywell and we completed this sale in July for $87 million in proceeds. These various actions show that we continue to make progress. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, we have the strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in our retail and logistics businesses. We also remain focused on improving the overall reliability and competitiveness of our refineries. Our refining organization tackled the recent operational issues and implemented fixes to the areas impacted and continued to implement the lessons learned across the system. The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and delivering value to shareholders, remains a top priority. The recent initial public offering of SunCoke common stock was an unqualified success and makes the culmination of more than a year's worth of planning. Sunoco currently retains approximately 81% ownership of SunCoke and expects to distribute its common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within the year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We reported pretax income of $71 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the second quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable",1630,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $71 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the second quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable special items of $294 million pretax were primarily associated with provisions to write down assets at the Frankfurt and Haverhill chemical facilities to their estimated fair values. Regarding Q2 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7. 
First, let's discuss the Retail and Logistics segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. These 2 businesses earned $123 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter. Retail Marketing earned $69 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during the quarter, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $0.124 per gallon. Gasoline volumes in the second quarter trended lower by approximately 3% versus the same period last year on a same-store sales basis, which is largely consistent with the EIA data. Distillate volumes also trended lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Both gasoline and diesel prices at the pump approach near record highs for this time of the year, which had a detrimental impact to volumes. Total gasoline volumes for our network were up about 3% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to new sites added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within our distributor network. Logistics earned $54 million pretax in the second quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership and Sunoco Logistics Partners, which reported record earnings in the second quarter. The increase versus last year was primarily in the crude oil segment. Demand for West Texas crude is at very high level, translating into tremendous demand for SXL services, including their proprietary pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley pipeline joint ventures and SXL's trucking services. There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to a higher lease volumes and margins in addition to continuing contango market structure. The throughput in tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities. The logistics business also continues to demonstrate great success in its pursuit of growth. Including the recently announced acquisition of the Texon crude oil leasing business, Sunoco Logistics Partners has announced over $450 million in acquisitions year-to-date. Additionally, Sunoco Logistics Partners has projected organic expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding the mariner projects and the West Texas Gulf pipeline expansion. 
Our Coke segment earned $20 million pretax in Q2. The improvements from the first quarter results was largely driven by earnings at our Indiana Harbor facility, including the absence of costs incurred in Q1 to purchase coke for the expected Q2 shortfalls. Partially offsetting the improvements in Indiana Harbor reflected in Q2 results were higher expenses primarily related to preparation to operate as a separate public company, as well as headquarters relocation. 
Now turning to refining and supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $44 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011, an improvement of $94 million pretax compared to the first quarter 2011. As Lynn discussed earlier, our second quarter performance was impacted by the low April utilization that carried over from the first quarter's operating events. April was one of our worst performing months ever as we continued maintenance activities in Philadelphia through most of the month and markets remained down for several days into April following the loss of power at the end of March. During the quarter, our crude utilization rate averaged 84% for the quarter, but the May and June period reflected dramatic improvements with the rate of 94%. As we noted in our first quarter conference call, at the beginning of May, we felt confident that we addressed the issues encountered during the first 4 months of the year and our profitable results and utilization above 90% in the last 2 months of the quarter reflect this improvement. It is clear that our plants run reliably and with high utilization in order to be profitable. As we experienced in the first quarter and even worst in April, with such low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed cost and our margin capture suffered as well as the suboptimal products and product purchases required to meet contractual requirements. Even as we return to optimal utilization rates in May and June, our margin capture continued to be negatively impacted as we rebalanced our system, including inventories of crude and intermediate products. Before we discuss our Q2 margin realizations, I'll take a quick moment to explain some changes we made our refining and supply benchmarks starting with this quarter's reporting of results. After the sale of the Toledo refinery, we took the opportunity to review our benchmarks to make some adjustments to arrive at an appropriate benchmark that reflects current market conditions and our operating systems capabilities. The new benchmark components are detailed on Slide 22, which reflect 3 changes. Firstly, higher crude transportation costs of $0.50 per barrel to $2.75 per barrel, reflecting a stronger market that has persisted since at least early 2010. Secondly, replacement of conventional unleaded gasoline with gasoline better reflecting our production as well as a more liquid product market. And lastly, a benchmark that reflects a blend of 0.3% sulfur and 1% sulfur to better represent our production slate. For comparative purposes, we restated the prior periods shown back at first quarter 2010 so you can appropriately evaluate how we have trended during these periods. 
Moving on with respect to our Q2 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude cost and product dips versus our benchmark. As you can just on Slide 6, our refining and supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the second quarter and margin capture average 91%. Again, our margin capture averaged 71%. Again, margin realizations in April were extremely poor due to low utilization rates. Poor reliability results in suboptimal production, poor conversion rates, lack of reliability and a required purchase of product to meet contractual requirements. Generally, market conditions in the Northeast improved in the second quarter versus prior quarters and with our return to more optimal utilization rates in May and June, we were able to generate much better margin realizations. However, we also experienced higher crude costs versus prior quarters due to the widening of the West African crude dips versus Brent and a higher quality mix of crude purchases as we rebalanced our crude mix in the system. This was partially offset by timing benefit due to falling crude prices and an inventory benefit within the overall crude differential. 
In summary, we are pleased with the improvements that we made in our refining and supply systems since the beginning of May. By the end of June, our system was positioned to run well operationally and seize opportunities in the marketplace as they become available. We feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market, in order to generate value from these refining assets. We will maintain focus on the elements within our control that drive optimal performance in whatever environment exists. 
In wrapping up our reporting segments, our Chemicals Business reported pretax income of $6 million for the second quarter as feedstock availability improved from the first quarter, with the return of normal operations at the Philadelphia refinery in May. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of June. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a cash flow perspective, in the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of approximately $170 million before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $335 million, excluding SXL and a net debt to capital ratio of negative 13% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL. At June 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. Cash was largely flat until the end of the prior quarter as working capital impacts largely netted out. We received $285 million of cash proceeds related to the PBF note receivable for inventory sold with Toledo refinery. But this benefit was offset to a large degree by other net working capital used during the quarter. Working capital flows included cash proceeds from crude inventory draw but this was offset by working capital uses related to seasonal refined product bills and the crude price decline with used overall crude payables. Second quarter cash flow activity also included the repayment of $177 million debt that came due on April 1. In July, with the successful IPO of SunCoke, Sunoco at the parent level has received $775 million in proceeds. This consists of $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of the $700 million of borrowings by SunCoke and approximately $200 million from the initial public offering of 13.34 million shares of SunCoke Energy, including the underwriters' overall allotment witch was exercised. As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the volatile refining environment. With that, I'll ask the moderator to open up the lines for any questions you may have."

With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; John P",808,"Thank you. Thank you and good evening, and welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will discuss the company's second quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; John Pickering, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release.
Now, let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $49 million or $0.40 per share. When I look at the performance in the second quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from Logistics and Retail, the 2 growth areas of our business. Logistics contributed $54 million in pretax income as Sunoco Logistics Partners generated record quarterly results, driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment, as well as contributions from acquisitions and organic expansions in the past year. The $69 million in pretax income earned in retail was a new record second quarter performance, and resulted from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices, which expanded margins.
Second, the importance of reliability in our manufacturing operations cannot be overstated. In Refining and Supply, our ability to take advantage of margin improvement was limited by low utilization stemming from first quarter operational issues that continued into April. As you may recall from last quarter's conference call, there was a total refinery shutdown at Marcus Hook that occurred in late March, which was caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier. The market Marcus Hook unit affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. At Philadelphia refinery, maintenance work aimed at addressing the reliability and efficiency of our units extended into the third week of April. With these issues resolved, refining and supply was profitable in May and June as crude unit utilization improved to 94% for this 2-month period. Along with safety and reliability, margin capture remains an area of focus for us 
Third, we continue to make progress in growing key parts of our business. In our Logistics segment, we have announced more than $450 million worth of acquisitions year-to-date. Most recently, Sunoco Logistics announced the purchase of a controlling interest in Inland Corporation's pipelines and other assets that serve the Mid-Continent. The purchase of East Boston terminal, the sole service provider for Logan International Airport, the purchase of Eagle Point Tank Farm and related assets from Sunoco, which Sunoco Logistics plans to turn into a major refined products terminal on the East Coast with import and export capabilities and the purchase of a lease crude business from Texon LP, an acquisition that significantly increases the partnership's position in key oil-producing regions and growing shale areas.
On the Retail side, growth has been more modest but continues nonetheless. In June, we announced the expansion of our retail network into Alabama, with 13 new Sunoco-branded distributor locations. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement to acquire leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company-operated and include an APlus Convenience Store. With these expansions, we have added approximately 215 new retail sites to our network since the beginning of 2010. We also continued to release capital through the divestment of non-core assets. During the second quarter, we announced an agreement to sell our phenol and acetone manufacturing facility in the Frankfurt section of Philadelphia to Honeywell, and we completed this sale in July for $87 million in proceeds.
These various actions show that we continue to make progress. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, we have the strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in our retail and logistics businesses. We also remain focused on improving the overall reliability and competitiveness of our refineries. Our refining organization tackled the recent operational issues and has implemented fixes to the areas impacted and continued to implement the lessons learned across the system. The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and delivering value to shareholders, remains a top priority. The recent initial public offering of SunCoke common stock was an unqualified success and makes the culmination of more than a year's worth of planning. Sunoco currently retains approximately 81% ownership of SunCoke and expects to distribute its common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within the year.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items.

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $71 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the second quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable special items of $294 million, pretax, were primarily associated with provisions to write down assets at the Frankfurt and Haverhill chemical facilities to their estimated fair values. Regarding Q2 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7.
First, let's discuss the Retail and Logistics segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. These 2 businesses earned $123 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter. Retail Marketing earned $69 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during the quarter, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $0.124 per gallon. Gasoline volumes in the second quarter trended lower by approximately 3% versus the same period last year on a same-store sales basis, which is largely consistent with the EIA data. Distillate volumes also trended lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Both gasoline and diesel prices at the comps approached near record highs for this time of the year, which had a detrimental impact to volumes. Total gasoline volumes for our network were up about 3% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to new sites added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within our distributor network.
Logistics earned $54 million pretax in the second quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics Partners, which reported record earnings in the second quarter. The increase versus last year was primarily in the crude oil segment. Demand for West Texas crude is up from very high level, translating into tremendous demand for SXL services, including their proprietary pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline joint ventures and SXL's trucking services. There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to a higher lease volumes and margins in addition to continuing contango market structure. The throughput in Tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business, and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities. The Logistics business also continues to demonstrate great success in its pursuit of growth. Including the recently announced acquisition of the Texon Crude leasing business, Sunoco Logistics Partners has announced over $450 million in acquisitions year-to-date. Additionally, Sunoco Logistics Partners has projected organic expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding the Mariner projects and the West Texas Gulf pipeline expansion.
Our Coke segment earned $20 million pretax in Q2. The improvements from the first quarter results was largely driven by earnings at our Indiana Harbor facility, including the absence of costs incurred in Q1 to purchase coke for the expected Q2 shortfalls. Partially offsetting the improvements at Indiana Harbor reflected in Q2 results were higher expenses primarily related to preparation to operate as a separate public company, as well as headquarters relocation. 
Now turning to refining and supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $44 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011, an improvement of $94 million pretax compared to the first quarter 2011. As Lynn discussed earlier, our second quarter performance was impacted by the low April utilization that carried over from the first quarter's operating events. April was one of our worst performing months ever as we continued maintenance activities in Philadelphia through most of the month and Marcus Hope units remained down for several days into April following the loss of power at the end of March. During the quarter, our crude utilization rate averaged 84% for the quarter, but the May and June period reflected dramatic improvements with the rate of 94%. As we noted in our first quarter conference call at the beginning of May, we felt confident that we addressed the issues encountered during the first 4 months of the year and our profitable results and utilization above 90% in the last 2 months of the quarter reflect this improvement.
It is clear that our plants must run reliably and with high utilization in order to be profitable. As we experienced in the first quarter and even worst in April, with such low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed cost and our margin capture suffers as well as the suboptimal products slate and product purchases required to meet contractual requirements. Even as we returned to optimal utilization rates in May and June, our margin capture continued to be negatively impacted as we rebalanced our system, including inventories of crude and intermediate products.
Before we discuss our Q2 margin realizations, I'll take a quick moment to explain some changes we've made to our Refining and Supply benchmarks starting with this quarter's reporting of results. After the sale of the Toledo refinery, we took the opportunity to review our benchmarks to make some adjustments to arrive at an appropriate benchmark that reflects current market conditions and our operating systems' capabilities. The new benchmark components are detailed on Slide 22, which reflect 3 changes. Firstly, higher crude transportation costs of $0.50 per barrel to $2.75 per barrel, reflecting a stronger market that has persisted since at least early 2010. Secondly, replacement of conventional unleaded gasoline with CBOB gasoline, better reflecting our production as well as a more liquid product market. And lastly, a Resid benchmark that reflects a blend of 0.3% sulfur and 1% sulfur 6 oil to better represent our production slate. For comparative purposes, we restated the prior periods shown back to the first quarter 2010 so you can appropriately evaluate how we have trended during these periods. 
Moving on with respect to our Q2 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude cost and product dips versus our benchmark. As you can just on Slide 6, our Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the second quarter and margin capture averaged 91%. Again, our margin realizations -- our margin capture averaged 71%. Again, margin realizations in April were extremely poor due to low utilization rates. Poor reliability results in suboptimal production, poor conversion rates, lack of ratability and a required purchase of product to meet contractual requirements. Generally, market conditions in the Northeast improved in the second quarter versus prior quarters and with our return to more optimal utilization rates in May and June, we were able to generate much better margin realizations. However, we also experienced higher crude cost versus prior quarters due to the widening of the West African crude dips versus Dated Brent at a higher quality mix of crude purchases as we rebalanced our crude mix in the system. This was partially offset by timing benefit due to falling crude prices and an inventory benefit within the overall crude differential.
In summary, we are pleased with the improvements that we made in our Refining and Supply systems since the beginning of May. By the end of June, our system was positioned to run well operationally and seize opportunities in the marketplace as they become available. We feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. In order to generate value from these refining assets, we will maintain focus on the elements within our control to drive optimal performance in whatever environment exists. In wrapping up our reporting segments, our Chemicals business reported pretax income of $6 million for the second quarter as feedstock availability improved from the first quarter, with the return of normal operations at the Philadelphia refinery in May. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of June. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a cash flow perspective, in the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of approximately $170 million before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $335 million, excluding SXL and a net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 13% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL. At June 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco excluding SXL. Cash was largely flat through the end of the prior quarter as working capital impacts largely netted out. We received $285 million of cash proceeds related to the PBF note receivable for inventory sold with the Toledo refinery. But this benefit was offset to a large degree by other net working capital used during the quarter. Working capital flows included cash proceeds from crude inventory draw, but this was offset by working capital uses related to seasonal refined product bills and the crude price decline that reduced overall crude payables. Second quarter cash flow activity also included the repayment of $177 million debt that came due on April 1.
In July, with the successful IPO of SunCoke, Sunoco at the parent level has received $775 million in proceeds. This consists of $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of the $700 million of borrowings by SunCoke and approximately $200 million from the initial public offering of 13.34 million shares of SunCoke Energy, including the underwriters' overall allotment witch was exercised. As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the volatile refining environment.
With that, I'd ask the moderator to open up the lines for any questions you may have."

With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; John P",808,"Thank you. Thank you and good evening, and welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call, where we will discuss the company's second quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; John Pickering, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release.
Now, let's begin. As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $49 million or $0.40 per share. When I look at the performance in the second quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from Logistics and Retail, the 2 growth areas of our business. Logistics contributed $54 million in pretax income as Sunoco Logistics Partners generated record quarterly results, driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment, as well as contributions from acquisitions and organic expansions in the past year. The $69 million in pretax income earned in retail was a near record second quarter performance, and resulted from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices, which expanded margins.
Second, the importance of reliability in our manufacturing operations cannot be overstated. In Refining and Supply, our ability to take advantage of margin improvement was limited by low utilization stemming from first quarter operational issues that continued into April. As you may recall from last quarter's conference call, there was a total refinery shut down at Marcus Hook that occurred in late March, which was caused by interruption of power from our electricity supplier. The Marcus Hook units affected by the power interruption will return to service in the second week of April. At Philadelphia refinery, maintenance work aimed at addressing the reliability and efficiency of our units extended into the third week of April. With these issues resolved, Refining and Supply was profitable in May and June as crude unit utilization improved to 94% for this 2-month period. Along with safety and reliability, margin capture remains an area of focus for us 
Third, we continue to make progress in growing key parts of our business. In our Logistics segment, we have announced more than $450 million worth of acquisitions year-to-date. Most recently, Sunoco Logistics announced the purchase of a controlling interest in Inland Corporation's pipelines and other assets that serve the Mid-Continent. The purchase of East Boston terminal, the sole service provider for Logan International Airport, the purchase of Eagle Point Tank Farm and related assets from Sunoco, which Sunoco Logistics plans to turn into a major refined products terminal on the East Coast with import and export capabilities and the purchase of a lease crude business from Texon LP, an acquisition that significantly increases the partnership's position in key oil-producing regions and growing shale areas.
On the Retail side, growth has been more modest but continues nonetheless. In June, we announced the expansion of our retail network into Alabama, with 13 new Sunoco-branded distributor locations. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement to acquire leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company-operated and include an APlus Convenience Store. With these expansions, we have added approximately 215 new retail sites to our network since the beginning of 2010. We also continued to release capital through the divestment of non-core assets. During the second quarter, we announced an agreement to sell our phenol and acetone manufacturing facility in the Frankfurt section of Philadelphia to Honeywell, and we completed this sale in July for $87 million in proceeds.
These various actions show that we continue to make progress. With $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, we have the strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in our Retail and Logistics businesses. We also remain focused on improving the overall reliability and competitiveness of our refineries. Our refining organization tackled the recent operational issues and have implemented fixes to the areas impacted and continued to implement the lessons learned across the system. The other part of our strategy, separating SunCoke Energy from Sunoco and delivering value to shareholders, remains a top priority. The recent initial public offering of SunCoke common stock was an unqualified success and makes the culmination of more than a year's worth of planning. Sunoco currently retains approximately 81% ownership of SunCoke and expects to distribute its common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within a year.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $71 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the second quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable special items of $294 million, pretax, were primarily associated with provisions to write down assets at the Frankfurt and Haverhill chemical facilities to their estimated fair values. Regarding Q2 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7.
First, let's discuss the Retail and Logistics segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. These 2 businesses earned $123 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter. Retail Marketing earned $69 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during the quarter, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $0.124 per gallon. Gasoline volumes in the second quarter trended lower by approximately 3% versus the same period last year on a same-store sales basis, which is largely consistent with the EIA data. Distillate volumes also trended lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Both gasoline and diesel prices at the pump approached near record highs for this time of the year, which had a detrimental impact to volumes. Total gasoline volumes for our network were up about 3% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to new sites added on the Garden State Parkway in New York State and within our distributor network.
Logistics earned $54 million pretax in the second quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics Partners, which reported record earnings in the second quarter. The increase versus last year was primarily in the crude oil segment. Demand for West Texas crude is at a very high level, translating into tremendous demand for SXL services, including their proprietary pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline joint ventures and SXL's trucking services. There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to the higher lease volumes and margins in addition to continuing contango market structure. The throughput in tourmaline business has proven to be a ratable and growing business, and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities. The Logistics business also continues to demonstrate great success in its pursuit of growth. Including the recently announced acquisition of the Texon Crude leasing business, Sunoco Logistics Partners has announced over $450 million in acquisitions year-to-date. Additionally, Sunoco Logistics Partners has projected organic expansion capital to range from $100 million to $150 million, excluding the Mariner projects and the West Texas Gulf pipeline expansion.
Our Coke segment earned $20 million pretax in Q2. The improvements from the first quarter results was largely driven by earnings at our Indiana Harbor facility, including the absence of costs incurred in Q1 to purchase coke for the expected Q2 shortfalls. Partially offsetting the improvements at Indiana Harbor reflected in Q2 results were higher expenses primarily related to preparation to operate as a separate public company, as well as headquarters relocation. 
Now turning to refining and supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $44 million pretax in the second quarter of 2011, an improvement of $94 million pretax compared to the first quarter of 2011. As Lynn discussed earlier, our second quarter performance was impacted by the low April utilization that carried over from the first quarter's operating events. April was one of our worst performing months ever as we continued maintenance activities in Philadelphia through most of the month and Marcus Hook units remained down for several days into April following the loss of power at the end of March. During the quarter, our crude utilization rates averaged 84% for the quarter, but the May and June period reflected dramatic improvements with a rate of 94%. As we noted in our first quarter conference call at the beginning of May, we felt confident that we addressed the issues encountered during the first 4 months of the year and our profitable results and utilization above 90% in the last 2 months of the quarter reflect this improvement.
It is clear that our plants must run reliably and with high utilization in order to be profitable. As we experienced in the first quarter and even worse in April, with such low utilization, our production is unable to adequately cover fixed cost and our margin capture suffers as well as the suboptimal products slate and product purchases required to meet contractual requirements. Even as we returned to optimal utilization rates in May and June, our margin capture continued to be negatively impacted as we rebalanced our system, including inventories of crude and intermediate products.
Before we discuss our Q2 margin realizations, I'll take a quick moment to explain some changes we've made to our Refining and Supply benchmarks starting with this quarter's reporting of results. After the sale of the Toledo refinery, we took the opportunity to review our benchmarks and make some adjustments to arrive at an appropriate benchmark that reflects current market conditions and our operating systems' capabilities. The new benchmark components are detailed on Slide 22, which reflect 3 changes. Firstly, higher crude transportation costs of $0.50 per barrel to $2.75 per barrel, reflecting a stronger market that has persisted since at least early 2010. Secondly, replacement of conventional unleaded gasoline with CBOB gasoline, better reflecting our production as well as a more liquid product market. And lastly, a Resid benchmark that reflects a blend of 0.3% sulfur and 1% sulfur 6 oil to better represent our production slate. For comparative purposes, we restated the prior periods shown back to the first quarter 2010 so you can appropriately evaluate how we have trended during these periods. 
Moving on with respect to our Q2 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude cost and product dips versus our benchmark. As you can see on Slide 6, our Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $6.11 per barrel for the second quarter and margin capture averaged 91%. Again, margin realizations -- our margin capture averaged 71%. Again, margin realizations in April were extremely poor due to low utilization rates. Poor reliability results in suboptimal production, poor conversion rates, lack of ratability and the required purchase of product to meet contractual requirements. Generally, market conditions in the Northeast improved in the second quarter versus prior quarters and with our return to more optimal utilization rates in May and June, we were able to generate much better margin realizations. However, we also experienced higher crude costs versus prior quarters due to the widening of the West African crude dips versus Dated Brent, and a higher quality mix of crude purchases as we rebalanced our crude mix in the system. This was partially offset by timing benefit due to falling crude prices and an inventory benefit within the overall crude differential.
In summary, we are pleased with the improvements that we made in our Refining and Supply system since the beginning of May. By the end of June, our system was positioned to run well operationally and seize opportunities in the marketplace as they become available. We feel confident that we can execute on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. In order to generate value from these refining assets, we will maintain focus on the elements within our control to drive optimal performance in whatever environment exists. In wrapping up our reporting segments, our Chemicals business reported pretax income of $6 million for the second quarter as feedstock availability improved from the first quarter, with the return of normal operations at the Philadelphia refinery in May. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of June. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a cash flow perspective, in the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of approximately $170 million before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding SXL. We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $335 million, excluding SXL and a net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 13% at the Sunoco level excluding SXL. At June 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco excluding SXL. Cash was largely flat through the end of the prior quarter as working capital impacts largely netted out. We received $285 million of cash proceeds related to the PBF note receivable for inventory sold with the Toledo refinery. But this benefit was offset to a large degree by other net working capital used during the quarter. Working capital flows included cash proceeds from crude inventory draw, but this was offset by working capital uses related to seasonal refined product builds and the crude price decline that reduced overall crude payables. Second quarter cash flow activity also included the repayment of $177 million debt that came due on April 1.
In July, with the successful IPO of SunCoke, Sunoco at the parent level has received $775 million in proceeds. This consists of $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of the $700 million of borrowings by SunCoke and approximately $200 million from the initial public offering of 13.34 million shares of SunCoke Energy, including the underwriters' overallotment which was exercised. As we look forward to 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the volatile refining environment.
With that, I'd ask the moderator to open up the lines for any questions you may have."

Quarterly Conference Call where will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that reported this afternoon. 
With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. 
I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comments on our overall financial position. 
As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. 
I would also refer you to the safe harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release. 
Now let's begin.
As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $65 million or $0.57 per share. When I look at our performance in the third quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from Logistics and Retail, the 2 businesses we are growing. Logistics contributed $53 million in pretax income as Sunoco Logistics Partners generated record results for the second straight quarter, largely driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment. 
The $48 million in pretax income earned in Retail was a solid results given market conditions during the quarter. Our Retail team did a good job in capturing available margins in August and September. 
Second, market conditions in Refining and Supply continue to be challenging and we expect volatility at relatively low margins to persist for some time in our region. Refining and Supply was negatively impacted by the rapid deterioration in market conditions in September, which resulted in a loss for the quarter of $17 million pretax. This marks the ninth quarter out of the last 11 that we have lost money in Refining and Supply. We continue to pursue a sale of the refineries and plan to exit the Refining business by July 2012. 
Operationally, the refineries run well in the third quarter as crude utilization averaged 9% for this 3-month period, but we continue to evaluate ongoing operations in light of changing economic conditions. For as we long as we own and operate refineries, safety and reliability will remain key areas of focus. 
Third, delivering value to shareholders continues to be a top priority. We recently completed the previously announced $500 million share repurchase at an average price of $34.59 per share. We also continue to work towards completing the separation of SunCoke Energy from Sunoco. We completed the initial public offering of SunCoke in July. We currently retained approximately % ownership of the new public company and expect the distribute of our common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within a year of the initial public offering.
Our work to position Sunoco for future success is ongoing. In our Logistics segment, we have announced approximately $500 million in acquisition so far this year. The Eagle Point Tank Farm, the expanded leased Crude Oil business and a new terminal in East Boston are all operating well and Sunoco Logistics has seen a positive financial impact of these and other recent acquisitions. 
Sunoco Logistics announced an increase in the expected distribution growth for 2012 to 7%. As the largest holder of LTE units and the JP beholder, Sunoco continues to benefit from the strong strategic execution within Sunoco Logistics. 
On a Retail side, we continue to evaluate small and large growth opportunities as they arrive. In August, we acquired leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company operated and include an A+ convenience store. In the third quarter, we also opened the first 2 of 16 sites along the Ohio Turnpike as part of a previously announced agreement.
Excluding cash reported at Sunoco Logistics Partners and SunCoke, we have $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, which provides us strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in both Logistics and Retail. Positioning Sunoco for future success also entails exiting non-core and underperforming businesses. 
The previously announced sales of our Haverhill plant was closed at the end of October and marks our complete exit from the Chemicals business. 
Similarly, we continue to pursue a sale of our remaining Northeast refineries. Transactions of the size and complexity take time to develop and are governed by confidentiality agreements. We will provide updates on the status of the sales process when we're able to do so.
Additionally, we are making progress on our comprehensive strategic review of the company with a focus on exiting of our refining business, determining the optimal allocation of our capital resources and maximizing the potential for our Retail and Logistics businesses. 
At this time, we have nothing to report on the review. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian"

Let me first comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $57 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the third quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable",1682,"Thanks, Lynn. Let me first comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $57 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the third quarter, excluding special items. 
Net unfavorable special items of approximately $1.9 billion pretax were primarily associated with provisions to write down the refining assets to their estimated fair market values in connection with Sunoco's decision to exit the refining business. 
As a reminder, upon the sale of the refineries, our of the main processing units, we expect to record a pretax gain related to the liquidation of associated inventories that would total approximately $2 billion at current market prices, which would largely offset the impairments recorded this quarter. 
Before we discuss business results, I'll note that we saw an income tax benefit in the third quarter even though we  recorded positive pretax income before special items. This is due in part to the impact of nonconventional fuel tax credits on the year-to-date tax rate. 
Additionally, income taxes for each quarter reflect the adjustment of the year-to-date levels computed using expected full year tax rate at the end of each quarter and the recognition of any discrete items.
Looking ahead when Sunoco is no longer the beneficiary of favorable tax benefit associated with SunCoke and the refining operations, we would expect our effective tax rate to be closer to the statutory rates in the range of 35% to 40%. 
Regarding  Q3 business results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7.
First, let's discuss the Retail and Logistics segments. Businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing and Logistics business earned $101 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter. 
Retail Marketing earned $48 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during August and September, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $.0105 per gallon. 
Total gasoline volumes for our network were up over 2% in the quarter versus the prior year, due to new sites added in New York State, the Garden State Parkway, Ohio Turnpike and our distributor network. 
On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes trended lower by approximately 2.9% versus the same period last year, which is largely consistent with the EIA data. 
Distillate volumes also trend at lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Demand was impacted by hurricane activity in the Northeast region in the late August, or early September time frame.
Now turning to Logistics, which earned $53 million pretax in the third quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership and Sunoco Logistics Partnerships which reported record earnings for the second quarter. The main driver for the strong result has been in the crude oil business. 
As we saw in the second quarter, demand for West Texas crude continues to be very high, translating into a tremendous demand for our Sunoco Logistics transportation services, including their wholly owned pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline joint ventures and their trucking services. There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to higher lease volumes and margins and the Texon crude business has boosted the expansion of leased acquisition business as well. 
The strategic focus in the terminal area is also delivered results. With the acquisitions during the third quarter of the $1.2 million-barrel refined product terminal in East Boston and the acquisition of the $5 million-barrel Eagle Point tank farm on the Delaware River. 
The Logistics business continues to demonstrate great success in growing its business segments and its geographic footprint. 
Year-to-date, Sunoco Logistics has spent $494 million for acquisitions and forecast $160 million in organic capital expansion for 2011, bringing the total expansion capital spending for 2011 to approximately $650 million.
Beyond that, Sunoco Logistics has a number of other opportunities for growth that they're actively pursuing, which includes the potential conversion of pipelines related to the growing development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale place. 
Sunoco Logistics also announced a successful binding open season for Meriwest, the first ethane pipeline solution in the Marcellus area that will deliver ethane to Sonia, Canada marketplace. 
July 2013 is expected to start up for this project. Additionally, exit sales continues to pursue the expansion of the West Texas Gulf system with expectations for our first quarter 2013 start up. 
As Lynn noted earlier, Sunoco Logistics provided guidance of 7% distribution growth for 2012, up from 6% in 2011 as the entity is successfully executing on its growth plan. 
Sunoco Logistics also announced the 3 for 1 split of its limited partner common units and Class A units last week, reflecting the confidence that the Board of Directors and the management has in our ability to grow earnings cash flow and distributions in the future.
Now turning to the Coke segment. The Coke segment earned $24 million pretax in Q3. Our Coke segment results reflects Sunoco's ownership of approximately 81% in SunCoke Energy, effective July 21 when we completed the initial public offering. The business segment results exclude financing costs, our share of Sun Coke's energy financing costs are shown within the financing segment. The business saw a sequential improvement as the domestic Coke making business operated more than 100% capacity and produce a record level of Coke during the quarter. The improvement in Coke and coal operations was partially offset by higher expenses reflecting cost related to the startup of the Middletown, Ohio facility and the transition to becoming an independent public company. 
SunCoke recently made its first delivery of Coke to our customer AK Steel from the new Middletown plant. The plant is to ramp up production at Middletown with the expectation to be operating at full capacity by mid 2012. 
During the quarter, SunCoke Energy acquired from an affiliate of GE Capital its entire 19% interest in the partnership owns Indiana Harbor Coke making facility, as a result of the transaction, SunCoke Energy now holds an 85% interest in the partnership and the remaining 15% interest is owned by an affiliate of DTE Energy.
Now turning to Refining and Supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $17 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, we had the best quarter since the third quarter of last year, even with the economic rate cuts in September and production impacts related to hurricane activity. 
July and August  were both profitable for this segment, but the Northeast market margins deteriorated rapidly in September and remained well below cash operating costs during most of the month. 
With respect to our Q3 margin realization, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude cost and product differential versus our benchmark. 
As you can see on Slide 6, our Refining and Supply benchmark averaged 587 per barrel for the third quarter and margin capture averaged 83%. Crude costs were $0.20 per barrel above benchmark for the quarter, while West African crude differentials continue to be high. In the third quarter, we were able to off set those differentials to a large degree with higher than normal purchases of high asset crudes and also crudes from the strategic petroleum reserve. Both of which were priced at a substantial discount brand. 
On the product side, our realization is improved in the last few quarters, but still lower than benchmark as yield gains report as a margins of non-crap products like propane and butanes due to higher crude cost. The refining market environment continues to be challenging through October in particular related to the strong differentials from light sweet West African crudes. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes of the summer financial position at the end of September. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9. From a fund flow perspective, in the third quarter, we had a net use in cash of approximately $96 million at Sunoco excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke. Cash defined from the end of the prior quarter due to temporarily build in working capital largely related to accrued activity as we implement an economic rate cuts, which impacted the inventory and payable balances at quarter end. Absent any significant fluctuations in the crude price, we expect reductions in working capital levels during the fourth quarter to yield positive cash flows of approximately $300 million. 
Other cash activity during the third quarter included approximately $767 million in proceeds received by the Sunoco parent related to the separation of SunCoke. This consists of approximately $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of SunCoke's $700 million of borrowings and $192 million net of fees from the IPO of 13.3 million shares of SunCoke.
The company also successfully completed the repurchase of $500 million in common stock. Lastly, Sunoco received proceeds of approximately $85 million with the sale of the Frankfurt chemical facility. 
We entered the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $389 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke and net debt to capital of approximately negative 43% at the Sunoco level, excluding SXL and SunCoke.
At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash and approximately $1.4 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco. The fourth quarter cash flow benefit from approximately $100 million of proceeds from the sale of Haverhill facility, which closed in late October in addition to the expected release of working capital previously mentioned. 
Looking ahead, we continue to work diligently on the refining exit and the associated sales process as well as the comprehensive strategic review of the company. Additionally, we will be evaluating the timing to complete the separation of the SunCoke business. 
In the meantime, we also continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses and write off the volatile refining environment. 
With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines to questions."

And ultimately, the final determination will be made by Sunoco's Board when the Sunoco Board and ourselves thinks it's in the best interest of Sunoco's shareholders and just remind everybody that it was the overwhelming view of Sunoco shareholders that the business would be separated. And in June 2010, we did announce the separation. In July of 2011, we did an IPO with some very fortunate timing before major market dislocation. So I think we're clearly on the path towards separation. And I think shareholders will have to face that will make that determination around the last step of the process.

Welcome to Sunoco'sQuarterly Conference Call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon.With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, M",809,"Thank you, and good evening. Welcome to Sunoco's
Quarterly Conference Call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon.
With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations.
I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks.
I would also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package and is included in this afternoon's earnings release.
Now let's begin.
As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $65 million or $0.57 per share. When I look at our performance in the third quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from Logistics and retail, the 2 businesses we are growing. Logistics contributed $53 million in pretax income as Sunoco Logistics Partners generated record results for the second straight quarter, largely driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment. The $48 million in pretax income earned in retail was a solid result, given market conditions during the quarter. Our retail team did a good job of capturing available margins in August and September.
Second, market conditions in Refining and Supply continue to be very challenging, and we expect volatility at relatively low margins to persist for some time in our region. Refining and Supply was negatively impacted by the rapid deterioration in market conditions in September, which resulted in a loss for the quarter of $17 million pretax. This marks the ninth quarter out of the last 11 that we have lost money in Refining and Supply. We continue to pursue a sale of the refineries and plan to exit the refining business by July 2012.
Operationally, the refineries ran well during the third quarter as crude utilization averaged 9% for this 3-month period, but we continually evaluate ongoing operations in light of changing economic conditions. For as we long as we own and operate the refineries, safety and reliability will remain key areas of focus.
Third, delivering value to shareholders continues to be a top priority. We recently completed the previously announced $500 million share repurchase at an average price of $34.69 per share. We also continued to work towards completing the separation of SunCoke Energy from Sunoco. We completed the initial public offering of SunCoke in July. We currently retain approximately 81% ownership of the new public company and expect the distribute our common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within a year of the initial public offering.
Our work to position Sunoco for future success is ongoing. In our Logistics segment, we have announced approximately $500 million in acquisitions so far this year. The Eagle Point Tank Farm, the expanded leased crude oil business and a new terminal in East Boston are all operating well, and Sunoco Logistics is seeing the positive financial impact of these and other recent acquisitions.
Sunoco Logistics announced an increase in the expected distribution growth for 2012 to 7%. As the largest holder of LP units and the GP holder, Sunoco continues to benefit from the strong strategic execution within Sunoco Logistics.
On the retail side, we continue to evaluate small and large growth opportunities as they arrive. In August, we acquired leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company-operated and include an APlus Convenience Store. In the third quarter, we also opened the first 2 of 16 sites along the Ohio Turnpike as part of a previously announced agreement.
Excluding cash reported at Sunoco Logistics Partners and SunCoke, we have $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, which provides us with strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in both Logistics and retail. Positioning Sunoco for future success also entails exiting non-core and underperforming businesses.
The previously announced sale of our Haverhill phenol plant was closed at the end of October and marks our complete exit from the chemicals business.  Similarly, we continued to pursue a sale of our remaining Northeast refineries. Transactions of this size and complexity take time to develop and are governed by confidentiality agreements. We will provide updates on the status of the sales process when we are able to do so.
Additionally, we are making progress on our comprehensive strategic review of the company with a focus on exiting the refining business, determining the optimal allocation of our capital resources and maximizing the potential for our retail and Logistics businesses. At this time, we have nothing to report on the review.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Let me first comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $57 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the third quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable special items of approximately $1.9 billion pretax were primarily associated with provisions to write down the refining assets to their estimated fair market values in connection with Sunoco's decision to exit the refining business.
As a reminder, upon the sale of the refineries or idling of the main processing units, we expect to record a pretax gain related to the liquidation of associated inventories that would total approximately $2 billion at current market prices, which would largely offset the impairments recorded this quarter.
Before we discuss business results, I'll note that we saw an income tax benefit in the third quarter even though we recorded positive pretax income before special items. This is due in part to the impact of nonconventional fuel tax credits on the year-to-date tax rate. Additionally, income taxes for each quarter reflect the adjustment of the year-to-date levels computed using the expected full year tax rate at the end of each quarter and the recognition of any discrete items.
Looking ahead when Sunoco is no longer the beneficiary of favorable tax benefit associated with SunCoke and the refining operations, we would expect our effective tax rates to be closer to the statutory rates in the range of 35% to 40%.
Regarding  Q3 business results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7.
First, let's discuss the retail and Logistics segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing and Logistics businesses earned $101 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter.
Retail Marketing earned $48 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during August and September, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $0.105 per gallon.
Total gasoline volumes for our network were up over 2% in the quarter versus the prior year due to new sites added in New York State, the Garden State Parkway, Ohio Turnpike and our distributor network.  On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes trended lower by approximately 2.9% versus the same period last year, which is largely consistent with the EIA data.
Distillate volumes also trended lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Demand was impacted by hurricane activity in the Northeast region in the late August-early September timeframe.
Now turning to Logistics, which earned $53 million pretax in the third quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics partnerships, which reported record earnings for the second quarter. The main driver for the strong results has been in the crude oil business.
As we saw in the second quarter, demand for West Texas crude continues to be very high, translating into a tremendous demand for Sunoco Logistics transportation services, including their wholly owned pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline joint ventures, and their trucking services.
There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to higher lease volumes and margins. And the Texon crude business has boosted the expansion of the leased acquisition business as well.
The strategic focus in the terminals areas has also delivered results with the acquisition during the third quarter of the 1.2 million-barrel refined products terminal in East Boston and the acquisition of the 5 million-barrel Eagle Point Tank Farm on the Delaware River.
The Logistics business continues to demonstrate great success in growing its business segments and its geographic footprint. Year-to-date, Sunoco Logistics has spent $494 million for acquisitions and forecast $160 million in organic capital expansion for 2011, bringing the total expansion capital spending for 2011 to approximately $650 million.
Beyond that, Sunoco Logistics has a number of other opportunities for growth that they are actively pursuing, which includes the potential conversion of pipelines related to the growing development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. 
Sunoco Logistics also announced a successful binding open season for Mariner West, the first ethane pipeline solution in the Marcellus area that will deliver ethane to Sarnia, Canada, marketplace.  July 2013 is the expected startup for this project.
Additionally, SXL continues to pursue the expansion of their West Texas Gulf System, with expectations for our first quarter 2013 startup. 
As Lynn noted earlier, Sunoco Logistics provided guidance of 7% distribution growth for 2012, up from 6% in 2011 as the entity is successfully executing on its growth plan.
Sunoco Logistics also announced the 3-for-1 split of its limited partner common units and Class A units last week, reflecting the confidence that the Board of Directors and the management has in our ability to grow earnings cash flow and distributions in the future.
Now turning to the Coke segment. The Coke segment earned $24 million pretax in Q3. Our Coke segment results reflects Sunoco's ownership of approximately 81% in SunCoke Energy, effective July 21 when we completed the initial public offering. The business segment results exclude financing cost. Our share of SunCoke's energy financing costs are shown within the financing segment.
The business saw a sequential improvement as the domestic coke-making business operated at more than 100% capacity and produced a record level of coke during the quarter. The improvement in coke and coal operations was partially offset by higher expenses reflecting costs related to the startup of the Middletown, Ohio, facility and the transition to becoming an independent public company.
SunCoke recently made their first delivery of coke to our customer AK Steel from the new Middletown plant. The plant is to ramp up production at Middletown with the expectation to be operating in full capacity by mid 2012.
During the quarter, SunCoke Energy acquired from an affiliate of GE Capital its entire 19% interest in the partnership that owns Indiana Harbor coke-making facility. As a result of the transaction, SunCoke Energy now holds an 85% interest in the partnership, and the remaining 15% interest is owned by an affiliate of DTE Energy.
Now turning to Refining and Supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $17 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, we had the best quarter since the third quarter of last year even with the economic rate cuts in September and production impacts related to hurricane activity.
July and August  were both profitable for this segment, but the Northeast market margins deteriorated rapidly in September and remained well below cash operating costs during most of the month.
With respect to our Q3 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude costs and product differential versus our benchmark.
As you can see on Slide 6, our Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $5.87 per barrel for the third quarter and margin capture averaged 83%. Crude costs were $0.20 per barrel, above benchmark for the quarter. While West African crude differentials continued to be high, in the third quarter, we were able to offset those differentials to a large degree with higher-than-normal purchases of high-asset crudes and also crude from the strategic petroleum reserve, both of which were priced at a substantial discount to date of print.
On the product side, our realizations were improved from the last 3 quarters but still lower than benchmark as yield gains are poor, as are margins of non-crack products like propane and butanes, due to higher crude cost. The refining market environment continues to be challenging through October, in particular related to the strong differentials from light sweet West African crudes.
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of September. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9.
From a fund flow perspective, in the third quarter, we had a net use in cash of approximately $96 million at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke. Cash declined from the end of the prior quarter due to temporarily builds in working capital largely related to crude activity as we implemented economic rate cuts, which impacted the inventory and payables balances at quarter end. Absent any significant fluctuations in the crude price, we expect reductions in working capital levels during the fourth quarter to yield positive cash flows of approximately $300 million.
Other cash activity during the third quarter included approximately $767 million in proceeds received by the Sunoco parent related to the separation of SunCoke. This consists of approximately $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of SunCoke's $700 million of borrowings and $192 million net of fees from the IPO of 13.3 million shares of SunCoke.
The company also successfully completed the purchase -- the repurchase of $500 million in common stock. Last week, Sunoco received proceeds of approximately $85 million with the sale of the Frankford chemical facility.
We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $389 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke, and net-debt-to-capital of approximately negative 43% at the Sunoco level, excluding SXL and SunCoke.
At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash and approximately $1.4 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco. The fourth quarter cash flows benefit from approximately $100 million of proceeds from the sale of the Haverhill facility, which closed in late October, in addition to the expected release of working capital previously mentioned.
Looking ahead, we continue to work diligently on the refining exit and the associated sales process as well as the comprehensive strategic review of the company. Additionally, we will be evaluating the timing to complete the separation of the SunCoke business.
In the meantime, we also continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses and write out the volatile refining environment.
With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines for questions."

And I'd just remind everybody that it was the overwhelming view of Sunoco shareholders that the business should be separated, and in June 2010, we did announce the separation. In July of 2011, we did an IPO with some very fortunate timing before a major market dislocation.

So what we're trying to do is move our margin mix to have a bigger percentage of the margin coming from convenience."

Welcome to Sunoco's
Quarterly Conference Call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon.
With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations.
I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today's call, I would direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks.
I would also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the slide package that is included in this afternoon's earnings release.
Now let's begin.
As you can see from Slide 3, we reported net income before special items of $65 million or $0.57 per share. When I look at our performance in the third quarter, I see 3 things. First, we had very strong performance from Logistics and retail, the 2 businesses we are growing. Logistics contributed $53 million in pretax income as Sunoco Logistics Partners generated record results for the second straight quarter, largely driven by market opportunities within our crude oil segment. The $48 million in pretax income earned in retail was a solid result, given market conditions during the quarter. Our retail team did a good job of capturing available margins in August and September.
Second, market conditions in Refining and Supply continue to be very challenging, and we expect volatility at relatively low margins to persist for some time in our region. Refining and Supply was negatively impacted by the rapid deterioration in market conditions in September, which resulted in a loss for the quarter of $17 million pretax. This marks the ninth quarter out of the last 11 that we have lost money in Refining and Supply. We continue to pursue a sale of the refineries and plan to exit the refining business by July 2012.
Operationally, the refineries ran well during the third quarter as crude utilization averaged 9% for this 3-month period, but we continually evaluate ongoing operations in light of changing economic conditions. For as we long as we own and operate the refineries, safety and reliability will remain key areas of focus.
Third, delivering value to shareholders continues to be a top priority. We recently completed the previously announced $500 million share repurchase at an average price of $34.69 per share. We also continued to work towards completing the separation of SunCoke Energy from Sunoco. We completed the initial public offering of SunCoke in July. We currently retain approximately 81% ownership of the new public company and expect to distribute our common stock holdings to Sunoco shareholders within a year of the initial public offering.
Our work to position Sunoco for future success is ongoing. In our Logistics segment, we have announced approximately $500 million in acquisitions so far this year. The Eagle Point Tank Farm, the expanded leased crude oil business and a new terminal in East Boston are all operating well, and Sunoco Logistics is seeing the positive financial impact of these and other recent acquisitions.
Sunoco Logistics announced an increase in the expected distribution growth for 2012 to 7%. As the largest holder of LP units and the GP holder, Sunoco continues to benefit from the strong strategic execution within Sunoco Logistics.
On the retail side, we continue to evaluate small and large growth opportunities as they arrive. In August, we acquired leasehold interest in 14 retail locations in Central Pennsylvania. Each location will be company-operated and include an APlus Convenience Store. In the third quarter, we also opened the first 2 of 16 sites along the Ohio Turnpike as part of a previously announced agreement.
Excluding cash reported at Sunoco Logistics Partners and SunCoke, we have $1.5 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, which provides us with strategic flexibility to continue pursuing growth in both Logistics and retail. Positioning Sunoco for future success also entails exiting non-core and underperforming businesses.
The previously announced sale of our Haverhill phenol plant was closed at the end of October and marks our complete exit from the chemicals business.  Similarly, we continued to pursue a sale of our remaining Northeast refineries. Transactions of this size and complexity take time to develop and are governed by confidentiality agreements. We will provide updates on the status of the sales process when we are able to do so.
Additionally, we are making progress on our comprehensive strategic review of the company with a focus on exiting the refining business, determining the optimal allocation of our capital resources and maximizing the potential for our retail and Logistics businesses. At this time, we have nothing to report on the review.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We reported pretax income of $57 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the third quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable",1676,"Thanks, Lynn.
Let me first comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $57 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in the third quarter, excluding special items. Net unfavorable special items of approximately $1.9 billion pretax were primarily associated with provisions to write down the refining assets to their estimated fair market values in connection with Sunoco's decision to exit the refining business.
As a reminder, upon the sale of the refineries or idling of the main processing units, we expect to record a pretax gain related to the liquidation of associated inventories that would total approximately $2 billion at current market prices, which would largely offset the impairments recorded this quarter.
Before we discuss business results, I'll note that we saw an income tax benefit in the third quarter even though we recorded positive pretax income before special items. This is due in part to the impact of nonconventional fuel tax credits on the year-to-date tax rate. Additionally, income taxes for each quarter reflect the adjustment of the year-to-date levels computed using the expected full year tax rate at the end of each quarter and the recognition of any discrete items.
Looking ahead when Sunoco is no longer the beneficiary of favorable tax benefits associated with SunCoke and the refining operations, we would expect our effective tax rates to be closer to the statutory rates in the range of 35% to 40%.
Regarding  Q3 business results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 7.
First, let's discuss the retail and Logistics segments, businesses which we continue to believe have the best prospects for growth. Our Retail Marketing and Logistics businesses earned $101 million pretax in aggregate during the quarter.
Retail Marketing earned $48 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Retail gasoline margins benefited from declining wholesale gasoline prices during August and September, resulting in average margins in the quarter of $0.105 per gallon.
Total gasoline volumes for our network were up over 2% in the quarter versus the prior year due to new sites added in New York State, the Garden State Parkway, Ohio Turnpike and our distributor network.  On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes trended lower by approximately 2.9% versus the same period last year, which is largely consistent with the EIA data.
Distillate volumes also trended lower than the prior year with a loss in volumes of about 1% on a same-store basis. Demand was impacted by hurricane activity in the Northeast region in the late August/early September timeframe.
Now turning to Logistics, which earned $53 million pretax in the third quarter. The earnings in this business are almost entirely related to Sunoco's ownership in Sunoco Logistics partnerships, which reported record earnings for the second quarter. The main driver for the strong results has been in the crude oil business.
As we saw in the second quarter, demand for West Texas crude continues to be very high, translating into a tremendous demand for Sunoco Logistics transportation services, including their wholly owned pipelines, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline joint ventures, and their trucking services.
There were also increases in crude production related to increases in drilling activity associated with the shale development, which led to higher lease volumes and margins. And the Texon crude business has boosted the expansion of the leased acquisition business as well.
The strategic focus in the terminals areas has also delivered results with the acquisition during the third quarter of the 1.2 million-barrel refined products terminal in East Boston and the acquisition of the 5 million-barrel Eagle Point Tank Farm on the Delaware River.
The Logistics business continues to demonstrate great success in growing its business segments and its geographic footprint. Year-to-date, Sunoco Logistics has spent $494 million for acquisitions and forecast $160 million in organic capital expansion for 2011, bringing the total expansion capital spending for 2011 to approximately $650 million.
Beyond that, Sunoco Logistics has a number of other opportunities for growth that they are actively pursuing, which includes the potential conversion of pipelines related to the growing development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. 
Sunoco Logistics also announced a successful binding open season for Mariner West, the first ethane pipeline solution in the Marcellus area that will deliver ethane to Sarnia, Canada, marketplace.  July 2013 is the expected startup for this project.
Additionally, SXL continues to pursue the expansion of their West Texas Gulf System, with expectations for our first quarter 2013 startup. 
As Lynn noted earlier, Sunoco Logistics provided guidance of 7% distribution growth for 2012, up from 6% in 2011 as the entity is successfully executing on its growth plan.
Sunoco Logistics also announced the 3-for-1 split of its limited partner common units and Class A units last week, reflecting the confidence that the Board of Directors and the management have in our ability to grow earnings cash flow and distributions in the future.
Now turning to the Coke segment. The Coke segment earned $24 million pretax in Q3. Our Coke segment results reflect Sunoco's ownership of approximately 81% in SunCoke Energy, effective July 21 when we completed the initial public offering. The business segment results exclude financing cost. Our share of SunCoke's energy financing costs are shown within the financing segment.
The business saw a sequential improvement as the domestic coke-making business operated at more than 100% capacity and produced a record level of coke during the quarter. The improvement in coke and coal operations was partially offset by higher expenses reflecting costs related to the startup of the Middletown, Ohio, facility and the transition to becoming an independent public company.
SunCoke recently made their first delivery of coke to our customer AK Steel from the new Middletown plant. The plan is to ramp up production at Middletown with the expectation to be operating at full capacity by mid 2012.
During the quarter, SunCoke Energy acquired from an affiliate of GE Capital its entire 19% interest in the partnership that owns Indiana Harbor coke-making facility. As a result of the transaction, SunCoke Energy now holds an 85% interest in the partnership, and the remaining 15% interest is owned by an affiliate of DTE Energy.
Now turning to Refining and Supply. Refining and Supply incurred a loss of $17 million pretax in the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, we had the best quarter since the third quarter of last year even with the economic rate cuts in September and production impacts related to hurricane activity.
July and August  were both profitable for this segment, but the Northeast market margins deteriorated rapidly in September and remained well below cash operating costs during most of the month.
With respect to our Q3 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 6 and 7 for more detail on the refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark.
As you can see on Slide 6, our Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $5.87 per barrel for the third quarter and margin capture averaged 83%. Crude costs were $0.20 per barrel, above benchmark for the quarter. While West African crude differentials continued to be high, in the third quarter, we were able to offset those differentials to a large degree with higher-than-normal purchases of high-asset crudes and also crude from the strategic petroleum reserve, both of which were priced at a substantial discount to Dated Brent.
On the product side, our realizations were improved from the last 3 quarters but still lower than benchmark as yield gains were poor, as were margins of non-crack products like propane and butanes, due to higher crude cost. The refining market environment continues to be challenging through October, in particular related to the strong differentials for light, sweet, West African crudes.
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of September. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 8 and 9.
From a fund flow perspective, in the third quarter, we had a net use in cash of approximately $96 million at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke. Cash declined from the end of the prior quarter due to temporarily builds in working capital largely related to crude activity as we implemented economic rate cuts, which impacted the inventory and payables balances at quarter end. Absent any significant fluctuations in the crude price, we expect reductions in working capital levels during the fourth quarter to yield positive cash flows of approximately $300 million.
Other cash activity during the third quarter included approximately $767 million in proceeds received by the Sunoco parent related to the separation of SunCoke. This consists of approximately $575 million that was received via distribution of a portion of the proceeds of SunCoke's $700 million of borrowings and $192 million net of fees from the IPO of 13.3 million shares of SunCoke.
The company also successfully completed the purchase -- the repurchase of $500 million in common stock. Last week, Sunoco received proceeds of approximately $85 million with the sale of the Frankford chemical facility.
We ended the quarter with cash exceeding debt by approximately $389 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics and SunCoke, and net-debt-to-capital of approximately negative 43% at the Sunoco level, excluding SXL and SunCoke.
At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash and approximately $1.4 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco. The fourth quarter cash flows benefit from approximately $100 million of proceeds from the sale of the Haverhill facility, which closed in late October, in addition to the expected release of working capital previously mentioned.
Looking ahead, we continue to work diligently on the refining exit and the associated sales process as well as the comprehensive strategic review of the company. Additionally, we will be evaluating the timing to complete the separation of the SunCoke business.
In the meantime, we also continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses and ride out the volatile refining environment.
With that, I'll ask the moderator to open the lines for questions."

And ultimately, the final determination will be made by Sunoco's Board when the Sunoco Board and ourselves thinks it's in the best interest of Sunoco's shareholders. And I'll just remind everybody that it was the overwhelming view of Sunoco shareholders that the business should be separated, and in June 2010, we did announce the separation. In July of 2011, we did an IPO with some very fortunate timing before a major market dislocation. So I think we're clearly on the path towards separation, and I think shareholders will have to have the faith in us that we'll make the determination around the last step of the process.

However, I don't -- we don't look at it as advantageous to just go anywhere where we could buy some stations. We think that it's better for us to really concentrate our growth in those areas where we have logistic advantages and to try to increase the density of our footprint where we are. And if that means adjacent, so slightly starting to move into areas that are adjacent to where we are, we would certainly be interested in that. And you will have seen some of that going into Alabama. We're already in Florida, we're already in I-95 Corridor. We don't tend to be as dense in Southeast as we are in the Northeast, but we're not looking, for example, to go to California or to go far afield."

We have a very well-known brand in the Northeast region and a brand that's more widely known mostly because of the affiliation that we have with NASCAR. And so in those marketplaces where NASCAR is popular, generally people know about the Sunoco brand. And we want to be an outstanding fuel retailer that has a compelling convenience offer. And so we score very well as a fuel retailer. We score about average as a convenience retailer. So a big part of unlocking the value here is, one, by increasing the number of stores that we own and operate and enjoy more of the convenience margin. And the other is to create compelling offers that get people from the forecourt into the store. The margins in general are better on convenience than they are on fuel. So what we're trying to do is move our margin mix to have a bigger percentage of the margin coming from convenience."
