Welcome to our year end 2010 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and; Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
We're conducting our call today from the headquarters of Marriott Vacation Club International in sunny warm Orlando, Florida. We discussed our plans to divide our company with our Vacation Club associates last night in a town hall meeting after we issued our press release. There is still a lot to be done but we're all quite excited by this terrific opportunity. So on today's call, we also have joining us our host here in Florida, Steve Weisz, President of Marriott Vacation Club International; John Geller, Chief Financial Officer of our current and future Timeshare business; as well as Bill Schaub, Vice Chairman of the company. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today are effective only today, February 15, 2011 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find definitions of the terms we refer to this morning in our Earnings Release on Page 16. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
We wanted to have an extended discussion of our major brand initiatives but we have too much ground to cover. 2010 was a stellar year for Marriott. REVPAR was outstanding, pricing turned up faster than many expected and we reached our leverage targets. Now solidly investment grade, we resumed share repurchases in the 2010 fourth quarter. With significant leverage to the improving operating environment, our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% in 2010 and 22% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, 11% excluding the impact of securitizations. 
We made significant progress growing our brands, opening almost 30,000 new rooms in 2010. We opened our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, and we announced two new brands, AC Hotels by Marriott, a growth vehicle for Europe and Latin America; and Autograph, a collection of independent and unique four- and five-star hotels. 
Autograph launched in January of 2010 and by year end already have 13 hotels operating, including the spectacular Cosmopolitan Las Vegas. With nearly 4,000 Autograph rooms added in less than a year, we could not be more pleased with the speed of the launch and the economics of the brand. The first seven Autograph hotels saw their REVPAR index grow by over 20 percentage points in the second half of 2010. These brands already resonate with owners and guests. 
Our other brands didn't stand still. Owners and franchisees invested in great rooms and our full-service brands, a very successful refreshing business public space in Courtyard and new designs for residents in SpringHill Suites and Fairfield Inn & Suites. We continued to see these growth opportunities in big emerging markets. In China, we have the best portfolio of luxurious city center property, typically carrying the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott and Renaissance brands. In gateway markets like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, our portfolio of hotels are second to none in quality or number. 
While our growth with these brands will continue in 2010, we stepped up our efforts by also expanding our moderate tier platforms. In India, we announced the rollout of Fairfield by Marriott, a product specifically designed for that market. And in Brazil, we announced plans to open 50 new Fairfield Hotels with their own environmentally-friendly design. 
Our Timeshare business had a great 2010, rolling out the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Points Program to great success, providing owners with greater flexibility and choice. And the business continued to right-size its overhead, as well as its sales and marketing costs. And for Timeshare, bigger changes are in the offing. Last night as you know, we announced a plan to divide the company's Lodging and Timeshare businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders. While many of you might first think this is Marriott International exiting the Timeshare business, we do not view it that way. We see it as setting up a platform for the Timeshare business, still linked to the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands to grow faster with independent capitalization but still adding loyal Marriott customers as they grow. 
We frequently talk about the tremendous growth opportunities in both our Lodging and Timeshare businesses so as we roll out this transaction, many may ask, ""Why do this?"" Simply put, we believe the two businesses appeal to different types of investors with different investment goals and risk profiles. Finding investors who want to invest in both industries together is more challenging than finding investors for each individually. We faced a similar challenge years ago as investors in our Lodging brand business were much less interested in lodging real estate. 
In the early 1990s, we resolved it with a spinoff which yielded two separate companies: Marriott International and Host Marriott, which of course is now today's Host Hotels & Resorts. Today, over 99% of the hotels in our system are owned by others, including a substantial number owned by real estate investment trusts. Many investors have told us that they like to specialize, concentrating on businesses with one core focus that they can understand and can value. 
Such specialization has largely not occurred in the Timeshare business until now. So why do this now? The transaction will create the largest pure-play Timeshare company in the world, a platform that will leverage the finest lodging brands around, our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, and allow them to continue to grow in this space. 
The past three years were difficult for the Timeshare industry. The consumer was hit hard in the recession and our sales felt the impact. During this time, our priorities were to right-size the business and maximize cash flow while also launching our new Points product. In these past three years, there was little need for us to invest incremental capital in the business. 
Today, our Timeshare Points Program is off to a great start. The business has proved its ability to drive cash flow even in an extraordinarily difficult market. And while the business is still rich with inventory, as the recovery progresses, opportunities for new investments will emerge. By spinning this business off, we are setting it up to be able to make those new investments and grow. 
At the same time from this transaction will also emerge a lodging brand company even more focused on its core business of generating management and franchise fees. Marriott International will still create value in the Timeshare business but through its brand equity rather than its balance sheet. Both companies will have the resources and talent for new growth and profitability. Both companies will have outstanding leadership teams and be market leaders. 
In sum, separating the businesses should generate greater opportunities and allow shareholders to better understand both companies' underlying value, strategy and competitive strengths. We ask your patience. Work has just begun on this transaction, and we have not yet filed a Form 10 SEC Registration Statement although we expect to do so sometime late in the second quarter. Until then, we won't be able to provide more financial details. 
For more about the business, I've asked Steve Weisz, the future CEO of the new Timeshare company, to talk to you a bit about MVCI's prospects. A 37-year Marriott veteran, Steve is a tremendous leader, understands this business very well and has done an outstanding job in his almost 14 years at the MVCI helm. Steve?"

Marriott entered the Timeshare business in 1984 with the acquisition of American Resorts, a small Florida company with a handful of resorts on Hilton island. Since then, the business has grown. In 2010 alone, as part of Marriott, segment revenues totaled over $1.5 billion, and segment pretax earnings total over $120 million. This is a successful, profitable business with an outstanding future. 
Today, we have the most resorts in the upscale Timeshare business, and customers simply love our product. Our 71-resort system offers high quality purpose-filled resorts and desirable locations in a variety of usage options. Following these transactions, owners and guests should see no change in the branding or quality of their properties, services, usage options, use of Marriott Rewards Points or access to Marriott International hotels. And following this foot, all of us at both companies will remain committed to delivering outstanding product and vacation experiences.  
While we aren't naming the new company today, we know that when we do, it will improve the name Marriott because of the tremendous competitive advantage the name conveys. In fact, we will have the exclusive rights to both the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott names as they apply to the Timeshare business under a long-term agreement for which we will pay a franchise fee to Marriott. At the same time, we will also be able to develop and operate Timeshare resorts under other brand names. 
here, our products of Marriott's deep-rooted corporate culture, which recognizes that we take care of the associate, which takes care of the guests and the guest returns. This will remain at the core of our new company's culture, and we believe the transaction will enable even more associate career opportunities in the future. 
Bill Shaw, who is retiring as Vice Chairman of Marriott at the end of March, will become Chairman of the Board of our new public Timeshare company. Bill's strong leadership, business and finance acumen and core belief in Marriott culture will serve our public shareholders well. Debbie Marriott Harrison, Mr. Marriott's daughter, will also serve on our Board of Directors. The Timeshare business is highly regulated, and Debbie's experience in corporate affairs at Marriott International makes her a great addition to the board. 
We see a bright future for this new company. Our new Points product has been very well received by customers. Timeshare demand correlates highly with consumer confidence, which is coming back. New construction starts in the Timeshare industry are very low as the industry continues to absorb existing inventory. In fact, at year end 2010, we had $1.5 billion in Timeshare inventory on the books, including over $730 million in finished goods, which should help minimize near-term cash needs. 
Looking further ahead, while we don't expect the new company to be investment-grade in the near term, we do expect that it will continue to securitize its consumer notes receivable and should require little additional incremental capital. We believe we will have the economic strength and flexibility to weather further economic cycles, as well as grow over time. 
Our overhead is in excellent shape. All-in-all, we believe our operating leverage at this stage of the recovery is a tremendous positive for the business. We expect the company will remain well-balanced with income coming from development, Timeshare resort management and the consumer financing business. 
In 1984, Marriott blazed new trails in the Timeshare industry with the introduction of the gold-plated Marriott brand. Today, the company is breaking new ground again by presenting investors with the opportunity to invest in a stand-alone, well-branded Timeshare company. I'm confident that we'll all look back on this as a defining moment, not only for Marriott Vacation Club International but for the entire Timeshare industry as well. Now to talk about the results for the rest of the company, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist."

Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our average items. The Lodging business rep",907,"Thanks, Steve. Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our average items. 
The Lodging business reported stronger-than-expected REVPAR and margins, which accounted for about $0.03 of the outperformance. Timeshare's contract sales exceeded the high end of expectations but profits were depressed by about $0.01 due to impairments for a few fractional projects due to slow sales pace. 
Fourth quarter adjusted G&A was higher than we estimated, with about $0.02 due to higher-than-expected owner workouts and about $0.01 in new infrastructure spending to drive growth in our international markets. Below the line, stronger-than-expected cash flow saved $0.01 on net interest expense. And on the tax line, we picked up about $0.03 due to certain revisions to prior year's estimated foreign tax expense and about $0.01 due to lower full year tax rate associated with the growth in our international operations. 
We adjusted our fourth quarter results for several unusual items, including an $84 million impairment charge associated with our consolidated inventory total yield system or CITY. CITY is a groundbreaking revenue management system that will provide our hotels the tools to yield managed group demand, including guest rooms, function space and catering. Marriott funded the upfront cost of CITY because of its significant potential to enhance our brand, increase competitive advantage and drive hotel profitability. 
We made the investment as we've made systems investments in the past, with expectation that we would recover our cost overtime from participating hotels. But the significant impact of the recent financial crisis and recession on owner and franchisee profitability occurred simultaneously with the scheduled system rollout in the beginning of the cost recovery process. Given this, along with the long-term nature of our relationships with our owners and franchisees, we agreed to absorb part of the cost of this system. 
Systemwide worldwide REVPAR rose 8% in the fourth quarter. In our North America lodging business, corporate transient business was very strong. Where the company managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, REVPAR for our premium corporate and above business rose 17%, with 9% coming from average daily rates. We continue to press retail rates higher. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of company-operated Marriott-branded hotels in North America raised retail rates, and one in four ways to rates more than 16%. 
Our limited-service hotels saw the impact of stronger business demand, particularly in the urban market. Limited-service systemwide North American REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. For company-operated Marriott hotels in North America, special corporate room nights increased 16% during the quarter. 
We're roughly 2/3 of the way done with special corporate rate negotiations for 2011, and the resulting rates for the completed accounts are running up at a high-single-digit rate over 2010 prices. Special corporate customers also tell us that they expect to be traveling more in 2011. 
Now while still lagging the transient recovery, group business continues to improve with significant short-term demand. The booking window has not lengthened, but we're already seeing price improvement. For country-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts, December group room rates rose nearly 5%. In new group bookings made in the 2010 fourth quarter for 2011 were up 21%, including an 11% higher room rate. In fact, we booked nearly $150 million of 2011 group business in the fourth quarter alone. 
Turning to development. We opened over 150 new properties in 2010, with nearly 30,000 rooms. At year end, our pipeline increased to nearly 105,000 rooms worldwide, with roughly 45,000 rooms in international markets. Roughly 35% of our pipeline rooms were under construction, and nearly 20% are awaiting conversion. For 2011, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase 17% to 26%, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide systemwide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to climb 12% to 18% for the full year. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.24 to $0.28 per share, assuming a 7% to 9% worldwide systemwide REVPAR increase. The first quarter reflects slower growth than the full year, largely due to timing issues for G&A and Timeshare. The first quarter 2011 G&A increase reflects a tough comparison to a $6 million guarantee reserve reversal and unusually low incentive compensation in the prior year quarter. 
For Timeshare, lower interest income in rental profits will likely depress results in the first quarter, but favorable development and solid cost controls should yield much stronger earnings in the remainder of the year. 
We haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is on adjusted for pro forma changes for incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $510 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Total investment spending in 2010 was about $400 million. We will be disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases but expect to return cash to shareholders if attractive investment opportunities do not appear. 
2010 was a turning point for Marriott's Lodging and Timeshare business. We are uniquely positioned with the largest portfolio of very strong brands, a sizable unit growth pipeline and significant near-term free cash flow. We're all looking forward to an exciting 2011. Alicia, we're pleased to take questions now."

So the two biggest investments we made in 2010, and they will probably be the two biggest that are in Carl's $500 million to $700 million of forecasted investment spending are the acquisitions we made of the Seville Hotel in Miami Beach and the Burners in London, both of which will be converted to EDITION Hotels after substantial reconstruction of those assets. At the beginning of 2010, we didn't know about either of those, and when the forecast either of them so we found them to be pretty compelling options for us and we jumped at that. As we look into 2011, particularly as it relates to your question about international growth, I think the places where it's mostly likely that we might invest would be things like the Fairfield rollout in India or the Fairfield rollout in Brazil, where we are in discussions with a number of equity partners about possibly taking the minority equity stake in some of those. But if we could do that to roll out a few dozen hotels, we might put some tens of millions of dollars, I suppose, any way to work over time. How much of that actually goes out the door in 2011 is still an open question because if we were to ink definitive deals today, it might still be a number of months before construction actually starts, which is where this spending is going to happen. And then I think as you'll recall from our Analyst Day in October, we have assumptions in a multiyear model that we might find a couple of full-service hotels per year to acquire within that converting to our brand and reselling. That is obviously going to be driven by the market and about the availability of deals, about attractiveness of pricing and whether or not in fact, our partners are stepping in to buy those assets, saving us the need to take a position in them at any time."

The other thing is that the segment has over $1.5 billion worth of inventories, as Steve mentioned, of which about $730 million of that is finished units.

Philosophically, we know some things already. We know that the securitization debt will go with the Timeshare company. As your question suggests, it's absolutely right, we would expect the Timeshare company to be adequately capitalized but not investment-grade. It will, in all likelihood, have a lower credit rating agency than a credit rating than Marriott International would. When you talk about Marriott International over time, it is certainly possible to run this model to get us debt-free in a relatively short period of time. That's not the way we will manage the business. I mean, we have long had a debt-to-EBITDA target around 3x. We ended 2010 with just a net debt-to-EBITDA of about 2.5x. And in the sense that shows your question at work, if we don't put much money out the door, the debt goes down quickly. We would anticipate over time though that we would continue to put solid investment-grade leverage on the company and use those resources, as Carl talked about before, either to invest in our business or to return to shareholders.

And so I think we're starting to see the benefit from a supply side of much less limited-service product coming on."

I mean, we're going to be focused on every part of the equation, Steve. So the easiest dollars to run through from the top line to the bottom is obviously dollars that are other coming through in rate. And so we have been very aggressive in driving rate all year 2010. We talked about this, I think, a month ago. But in our series of town halls that we've done with our leadership teams across the globe, and we've done a few dozen of them this year, we have made a point to give them the cover to drive rate and risk driving rate almost a little bit too high. And so we pushed that aggressively and deliberately. That's where we're going to continue to make sure we've got significant efforts focused so that's what the corporate negotiations have been about. Carl had some statistics about rate growth in the group bookings that were put on the books in the fourth quarter. And we'll stay as keenly focused on that as we possibly can. Beyond that, it's going to be every element of the expense line, and that's true from the property level all the way up through corporate to make sure that we're driving as much of that true as we possibly can. While we have already started to experience substantial recovery, we've got owners who remain under significant pressure, and we've got to make sure that we're driving as much of that incremental revenue through to the bottom line as we can. Obviously, the more we can drive margins, the more we're going to see improvement in incentive fee performance and our owned and leased portfolio small as it is. But we'll just stay focused on all at this time."

And as that channel grows, it will obviously reduce our average expense associated with bookings. Beyond that, we have long had the view, we still have a view that we are eager to sell rooms the way our customers want to buy them. And so if they want to use online travel card here, if they want to use a traditional travel agent, if they want to use a group intermediary, we've got relationships with all those folks that we value and that we try to make sure that we manage to get as big a share of the business that we can get out of those channels as is reasonable.

The second is we'll want a fee structure that is an appropriate incentive for this business to grow with us. And obviously, if we put a fee that is too high on their sales that potentially cause them to say, ""We're giving up two biggest share of our profits for those,"" we're going to tend to run that business away from us sooner rather than later, and we basically never want to run that business away from us.

It's about whether or not there are investment opportunities that exceed our cost of capital comfortably so that we can create value.

And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at it. So as Carl talked about with $500 million to $700 million of investment spending in our guidance, we think that with appropriate leverage, that leaves us $1 billion or so of additional capital that can be invested or returned to shareholders.

Joining me today are Carl Berquist, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and; Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
We're conducting our call today from the headquarters of Marriott Vacation Club International in sunny, warm Orlando, Florida. We discussed our plans to divide the company with our Vacation Club associates last night in a town hall meeting after we issued our press release. There is still a lot to be done, but we're all quite excited by this terrific opportunity. So on today's call, we also have joining us our host here in Florida, Steve Weisz, President of Marriott Vacation Club International; John Geller, Chief Financial Officer of our current and future Timeshare business; as well as Bill Shaw, Vice Chairman of the company. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 15, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find definitions of the terms we refer to this morning in our earnings release on Page 16. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
We wanted to have an extended discussion of our major brand initiatives, but we have too much other ground to cover. 2010 was a stellar year for Marriott. REVPAR was outstanding. Pricing turned up faster than many expected. And we reached our leverage targets. Now solidly investment grade, we resumed share repurchases in the 2010 fourth quarter. With significant leverage to the improving operating environment, our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% in 2010 and 22% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, 11% excluding the impact of securitizations. 
We made significant progress growing our brands, opening almost 30,000 new rooms in 2010. We opened our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, and we announced two new brands, AC Hotels by Marriott, a growth vehicle for Europe and Latin America; and Autograph, a collection of independent and unique four- and five-star hotels. 
Autograph launched in January of 2010 and by year end, already have 13 hotels operating including the spectacular Cosmopolitan Las Vegas. With nearly 4,000 Autograph rooms added in less than a year, we could not be more pleased with the speed of the launch and the economics of the brand. The first seven Autograph hotels saw their REVPAR index grow by over 20 percentage points in the second half of 2010. These brands already resonate with owners and guests. 
Our other brands didn't stand still. Owners and franchisees invested in great rooms and our full-service brands, a very successful, refreshing business public space in Courtyard and new designs for residents in SpringHill Suites and Fairfield Inn & Suites. We continue to see these growth opportunities in big emerging markets. In China, we have the best portfolio of luxurious city center properties, typically carrying the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Marriott and Renaissance brands. In gateway markets like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, our portfolio of hotels are second to none in quality or number. 
While our growth with these brands will continue in 2010, we stepped up our efforts by also expanding our moderate-tier platforms. In India, we announced the rollout of Fairfield by Marriott, a product specifically designed for that market. And in Brazil, we announced plans to open 50 new Fairfield Hotels with their own environmentally-friendly design. 
Our Timeshare business had a great 2010, rolling out the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Points Program to great success, providing owners with greater flexibility and choice. And the business continued to rightsize its overhead as well as its sales and marketing costs. And for Timeshare, bigger changes are in the offing. Last night, as you know, we announced the plan to divide the company's Lodging and Timeshare businesses into two separate publicly traded companies through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders. While many of you might first think this is Marriott International exiting the Timeshare business, we do not view it that way. We see it as setting up a platform for the Timeshare business and still linked to the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands to grow faster with independent capitalization but still adding loyal Marriott customers as they grow. 
We frequently talk about the tremendous growth opportunities in both our Lodging and Timeshare businesses. So as we roll out this transaction, many may ask, ""Why do this?"" Simply put, we believe the two businesses appeal to different types of investors with different investment goals and risk profiles. Finding investors who want to invest in both industries together is more challenging than finding investors for each individually. We faced a similar challenge years ago as investors in our Lodging brand business were much less interested in lodging real estate. 
In the early 1990s, we resolved it with a spinoff, which yielded two separate companies: Marriott International and Host Marriott, which, of course, is now today's Host Hotels & Resorts. Today, over 99% of the hotels in our system are owned by others, including a substantial number owned by real estate investment trusts. Many investors have told us that they like to specialize, concentrating on businesses with one core focus that they can understand and can value. Such specialization has largely not occurred in the Timeshare business until now. So why do this now? The transaction will create the largest pure-play Timeshare company in the world, a platform that will leverage the finest lodging brands around, our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, and allow them to continue to grow in this space. 
The past three years were difficult for the Timeshare industry. The consumer was hit hard in the recession and our sales felt the impact. During this time, our priorities were to rightsize the business and maximize cash flow while also launching our new Points product. In these past three years, there was little need for us to invest to incremental capital in the business. 
Today, our Timeshare Points Program is off to a great start. The business has proved its ability to drive cash flow even in an extraordinarily difficult market. And while the business is still rich with inventory, as the recovery progresses, opportunities for new investments will emerge. By spinning this business off, we are setting it up to be able to make those new investments and grow. 
At the same time, from this transaction will also emerge a lodging brand company even more focused on its core business of generating management and franchise fees. Marriott International will still create value in the Timeshare business but through its brand equity rather than its balance sheet. Both companies will have the resources and talent for new growth and profitability. Both companies will have outstanding leadership teams and be market leaders. 
In sum, separating the businesses should generate greater opportunities and allow shareholders to better understand both companies' underlying value, strategy and competitive strengths. We ask your patience. Work has just begun on this transaction, and we have not yet filed a Form 10 SEC Registration Statement, although we expect to do so sometime late in the second quarter. Until then, we won't be able to provide more financial details. 
For more about the business, I've asked Steve Weisz, the future CEO of the new Timeshare company, to talk to you a bit about MVCI's prospects.

Marriott entered the Timeshare business in 1984 with the acquisition of American Resorts, a small Florida company with a handful of resorts on Hilton Head Island. Since then, the business has grown. In 2010 alone as part of Marriott, segment revenues totaled over $1.5 billion, and segment pretax earnings totaled over $120 million. This is a successful, profitable business with an outstanding future. 
Today, we have the most resorts in the upscale Timeshare business, and customers simply love our product. Our 71-resort system offers high-quality, purpose-built resorts in desirable locations and a variety of usage options. Following these transactions, owners and guests should see no change in the branding or quality of their properties, services, usage options, use of Marriott Rewards Points or access to Marriott International hotels. And following the split, all of us at both companies will remain committed to delivering outstanding product and vacation experiences.  
While we aren't naming the new company today, we know that when we do, it will include the name Marriott because of the tremendous competitive advantage the name conveys. In fact, we will have the exclusive rights to both the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott names as they apply to the Timeshare business under a long-term agreement, for which we will pay a franchise fee to Marriott. At the same time, we will also be able to develop and operate Timeshare resorts under other brand names. 
All of us here are products of Marriott's deep-rooted corporate culture, which recognizes that we take care of the associate who takes care of the guest, and the guest returns. This will remain at the core of our new company's culture, and we believe the transaction will enable even more associate career opportunities in the future. 
Bill Shaw, who is retiring as Vice Chairman of Marriott at the end of March, will become Chairman of the Board of our new public Timeshare company. Bill's strong leadership, business and finance acumen and core belief in Marriott culture will serve our public shareholders well. Debbie Marriott Harrison, Mr. Marriott's daughter, will also serve on our Board of Directors. The Timeshare business is highly regulated, and Debbie's experience in corporate affairs at Marriott International makes her a great addition to the board. 
We see a bright future for this new company. Our new Points product has been very well received by customers. Timeshare demand correlates highly with consumer confidence, which is coming back. New construction starts in the Timeshare industry are very low as the industry continues to absorb existing inventory. In fact, at year-end 2010, we had $1.5 billion in Timeshare inventory on the books, including over $730 million in finished goods, which should help minimize near-term cash needs. 
Looking further ahead, while we don't expect the new company to be investment-grade in the near term, we do expect that it will continue to securitize its consumer notes receivable and should require little additional incremental capital. We believe we will have the economic strength and flexibility to weather further economic cycles as well as grow over time. 
Our overhead is in excellent shape. All in all, we believe our operating leverage at this stage of the recovery is a tremendous positive for the business. We expect the company will remain well balanced, with income coming from development, Timeshare resort management and the consumer financing business. 
In 1984, Marriott blazed new trails in the Timeshare industry with the introduction of the gold-plated Marriott brand. Today, the company is breaking new ground again by presenting investors with the opportunity to invest in a stand-alone, well-branded Timeshare company. I'm confident that we'll all look back on this as a defining moment, not only for Marriott Vacation Club International but for the entire Timeshare industry as well. 
And now to talk about the results of the rest of the company, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist."

Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. Our Lodging business",909,"Thanks, Steve. Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. 
Our Lodging business reported stronger-than-expected REVPAR and margins, which accounted for about $0.03 of the outperformance. Timeshare's contract sales exceeded the high end of expectations, but profits were depressed by about $0.01 due to impairments for a few fractional projects due to slow sales pace. 
Fourth quarter adjusted G&A was higher than we estimated, with about $0.02 due to higher-than-expected owner workouts and about $0.01 in new infrastructure spending to drive growth in our international markets. Below the line, stronger-than-expected cash flow saved $0.01 on net interest expense. And on the tax line, we picked up about $0.03 due to certain revisions to prior year's estimated foreign tax expense and about $0.01 due to lower full year tax rates associated with the growth in our international operations. 
We adjusted our fourth quarter results for several unusual items, including an $84 million impairment charge associated with our consolidated inventory total yield system or CITY. CITY is a groundbreaking revenue management system that will provide our hotels the tools to yield manage group demand, including guest rooms, function space and catering. Marriott funded the upfront cost of CITY because of its significant potential to enhance our brand, increase competitive advantage and drive hotel profitability. 
We made the investment as we've made systems investments in the past, with the expectation that we would recover our cost over time from participating hotels. But the significant impact of the recent financial crisis and recession on owner and franchisee profitability occurred simultaneously with the scheduled system rollout and the beginning of the cost-recovery process. Given this, along with the long-term nature of our relationships with our owners and franchisees, we agreed to absorb part of the cost of this system. 
Systemwide worldwide REVPAR rose 8% in the fourth quarter. In our North American Lodging business, corporate transient business was very strong. For the company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, REVPAR for our premium, corporate and above business rose 17%, with 9% coming from average daily rates. We continue to press retail rates higher. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of company-operated Marriott-branded hotels in North America raised retail rates, and one in four raised rates more than 16%. 
Our limited-service hotels saw the impact of stronger business demand, particularly in the urban markets. Limited-service systemwide North American REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. For company-operated Marriott hotels in North America, special corporate room nights increased 16% during the quarter. 
We're roughly 2/3 of the way done with special corporate rate negotiations for 2011, and the resulting rates for the completed accounts are running up at a high single-digit rate over 2010 prices. Special corporate customers also tell us that they expect to be traveling more in 2011. 
Now while still lagging the transient recovery, group business continues to improve with significant short-term demand. The booking window has not lengthened, but we are already seeing price improvement. For company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts, December group room rates rose nearly 5%, and new group bookings made in the 2010 fourth quarter for 2011 were up 21%, including an 11% higher room rate. In fact, we booked nearly $150 million of 2011 group business in the fourth quarter alone. 
Turning to development. We opened over 150 new properties in 2010, with nearly 30,000 rooms. At year end, our pipeline increased to nearly 105,000 rooms worldwide, with roughly 45,000 rooms in international markets. Roughly 35% of our pipeline rooms were under construction, and nearly 20% are awaiting conversion. 
For 2011, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase 17% to 26%, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide systemwide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to climb 12% to 18% for the full year. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.24 to $0.28 per share, assuming a 7% to 9% worldwide systemwide REVPAR increase. The first quarter reflects slower growth than the full year, largely due to timing issues for G&A and Timeshare. The first quarter 2011 G&A increase reflects a tough comparison to a $6 million guarantee reserve reversal and unusually low incentive compensation in the prior-year quarter. 
For Timeshare, lower interest income and rental profits will likely depress results in the first quarter, but favorable development profit reportability and solid cost controls should yield much stronger earnings in the remainder of the year. We haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is on adjusted pro forma changes for incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Total investment spending in 2010 was about $400 million. We will be disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases but expect to return cash to shareholders if attractive investment opportunities do not appear. 
2010 was a turning point for Marriott's Lodging and Timeshare business. We are uniquely positioned with the largest portfolio of very strong brands, a sizable unit growth pipeline and significant near-term free cash flow. We're all looking forward to an exciting 2011. Melissa, we're pleased to take the questions now."

Yes, and a little bit hard to predict in some ways. So the two biggest investments we made in 2010, and they will probably be the two biggest that are in Carl's $500 million to $700 million of forecasted investment spending, are the acquisitions we made of the Seville Hotel in Miami Beach and the Berners in London, both of which will be converted to EDITION Hotels after substantial reconstruction of those assets. At the beginning of 2010, we didn't know about either of those and wouldn't have forecasted either of them. So we found them to be pretty compelling options for us, and we jumped at them. As we look into 2011, particularly as it relates to your question about international growth, I think the places where it's mostly likely that we might invest would be things like the Fairfield rollout in India or the Fairfield rollout in Brazil, where we are in discussions with a number of equity partners about possibly taking the minority equity stake in some of those. But if we could do that to roll out a few dozen hotels, we might put some tens of millions of dollars I suppose anyway to work over time. How much of that actually goes out the door in 2011 is still an open question because if we were to ink definitive deals today, it might still be a number of months before construction actually started, which is where the spending is mostly going to happen. And then I think as you'll recall from our Analyst Day in October, we have assumptions in a multiyear model that we might find a couple of full-service hotels per year to acquire with the notion of converting to our brand and reselling. That is obviously going to be driven by the market and both availability of deals, attractiveness of pricing and whether or not, in fact, our partners are stepping in to buy those assets, saving us the need to take a position in them at any time."

But as you look at the balance sheet, I think the one thing you can focus on is one, the business does grow up very healthy cash flow this year, generating close to $250 million in cash flow. The other thing is that the segment has over $1.5 billion worth of inventory, as Steve mentioned, of which about $730 million of that is finished units. So you got a long runway of inventories, so to speak, that you can sell up to get a couple of years going there. The long-term view, though, as I think you would be right that as the company grows, they would approach the capital markets. How that approach occurs probably waits to be seen. But clearly, it's going to be a growth vehicle. And as a growth vehicle, it will approach capital markets to grow."

Philosophically, we know some things already. We know that the securitization debt will go with the Timeshare company. As your question suggests, it's absolutely right, we would expect the Timeshare company to be adequately capitalized but not investment-grade. It would, in all likelihood, have a lower credit rating agency than -- a credit rating than Marriott International would. When you talk about Marriott International over time, it is certainly possible to run this model to get us debt-free in a relatively short period of time. That's not the way we will manage the business. I mean, we have long had a debt-to-EBITDA target around 3x. We ended 2010 with just a debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-EBITDA of about 2.5x. And in a sense, that shows your question at work. If we don't put much money out the door, the debt goes down quickly. We would anticipate over time, though, that we would continue to put investment-grade, solid investment-grade leverage on the company and use those resources, as Carl talked about before, either to invest in our business or to return to shareholders.

Any kind of product type, we are committed to making it as powerful an engine as we can, so we are continually investing in it and revising it and using it as a way to not just sell rooms passively and responsibly to customers but find a way to reach out to them with offers and other things that we think will continue to drive that channel. And as that channel grows, it will obviously reduce our average expense associated with bookings. Beyond that, we have long had the view, we still have the view that we are eager to sell rooms the way our customers want to buy them. And so if they want to use online travel party or if they want to use their traditional travel agents, if they want to use a group intermediary, we've got relationships with all those folks that we value and that we try to make sure that we manage to get as big a share of the business that we can get out of those channels as is reasonable.

And obviously, if we put a fee that is too high on their sales that potentially cause them to say, ""We're giving up too big a share of our profits for those,"" we're going to tend to run that business away from us sooner rather than later, and we basically never want to run that business away from us.

And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at it. So as Carl talked about with $500 million to $700 million of investment spending in our guidance, we think that with appropriate leverage, that leaves us $1 billion or so of additional capital that can be invested or returned to shareholders.

Joining me today are Carl Berquist, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and; Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
We're conducting our call today from the headquarters of Marriott Vacation Club International in sunny, warm Orlando, Florida. We discussed our plans to divide the company with our Vacation Club associates last night in a town hall meeting after we issued our press release. There is still a lot to be done but we're all quite excited by this terrific opportunity. So on today's call, we also have joining us our host here in Florida, Steve Weisz, President of Marriott Vacation Club International; John Geller, Chief Financial Officer of our current and future Timeshare business; as well as Bill Shaw, Vice Chairman of the company. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 15, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find definitions of the terms we referred to this morning in our earnings release on Page 16. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
We wanted to have an extended discussion of our major brand initiatives, but we have too much other ground to cover. 2010 was a stellar year for Marriott. REVPAR was outstanding. Pricing turned up faster than many expected. And we reached our leverage targets. Now solidly investment grade, we resumed share repurchases in the 2010 fourth quarter. With significant leverage to the improving operating environment, our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% in 2010 and 22% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, 11% excluding the impact of securitizations. 
We made significant progress growing our brands, opening almost 30,000 new rooms in 2010. We opened our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, and we announced two new brands, AC Hotels by Marriott, a growth vehicle for Europe and Latin America; and Autograph, a collection of independent and unique four- and five-star hotels. 
Autograph launched in January of 2010 and by year end, already have 13 hotels operating including the spectacular Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. With nearly 4,000 Autograph rooms added in less than a year, we could not be more pleased with the speed of the launch and the economics of the brand. The first seven Autograph hotels saw their REVPAR index grow by over 20 percentage points in the second half of 2010. These brands already resonate with owners and guests. 
Our other brands didn't stand still. Owners and franchisees invested in great rooms and our full-service brands, a very successful refreshing business public space in Courtyard and new designs for residents in SpringHill Suites and Fairfield Inn & Suites. We continue to seize growth opportunities in big emerging markets. In China, we have the best portfolio of luxurious city center properties, typically carrying the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Marriott and Renaissance brands. In gateway markets like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, our portfolio of hotels are second to none in quality or number. 
While our growth with these brands will continue in 2010, we stepped up our efforts by also expanding our moderate-tier platforms. In India, we announced the rollout of Fairfield by Marriott, a product specifically designed for that market. And in Brazil, we announced plans to open 50 new Fairfield Hotels with their own environmentally-friendly design. 
Our Timeshare business had a great 2010, rolling out the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Points Program to great success, providing owners with greater flexibility and choice. And the business continued to right-size its overhead as well as its sales and marketing costs. And for Timeshare, bigger changes are in the offing. Last night, as you know, we announced a plan to divide the company's Lodging and Timeshare businesses into two separate publicly traded companies through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders. While many of you might first think this is Marriott International exiting the Timeshare business, we do not view it that way. We see it as setting up a platform for the Timeshare business still linked to the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands to grow faster with independent capitalization but still adding loyal Marriott customers as they grow. 
We frequently talk about the tremendous growth opportunities in both our Lodging and Timeshare businesses. So as we roll out this transaction, many may ask, ""Why do this?"" Simply put, we believe the two businesses appeal to different types of investors with different investment goals and risk profiles. Finding investors who want to invest in both industries together is more challenging than finding investors for each individually. We faced a similar challenge years ago as investors in our Lodging brand business were much less interested in lodging real estate. 
In the early 1990s, we resolved it with a spinoff, which yielded two separate companies: Marriott International and Host Marriott, which, of course, is now today's Host Hotels & Resorts. Today, over 99% of the hotels in our system are owned by others, including a substantial number owned by real estate investment trusts. Many investors have told us that they like to specialize, concentrating on businesses with one core focus that they can understand and can value. Such specialization has largely not occurred in the Timeshare business until now. So why do this now? The transaction will create the largest pure-play Timeshare company in the world, a platform that will leverage the finest lodging brands around, our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, and allow them to continue to grow in this space. 
The past three years were difficult for the Timeshare industry. The consumer was hit hard in the recession and our sales felt the impact. During this time, our priorities were to right-size the business and maximize cash flow while also launching our new Points product. In these past three years, there was little need for us to invest incremental capital in the business. 
Today, our Timeshare Points Program is off to a great start. The business has proved its ability to drive cash flow even in an extraordinarily difficult market. And while the business is still rich with inventory, as the recovery progresses, opportunities for new investments will emerge. By spinning this business off, we are setting it up to be able to make those new investments and grow. 
At the same time, from this transaction will also emerge a lodging brand company even more focused on its core business of generating management and franchise fees. Marriott International will still create value in the Timeshare business but through its brand equity rather than its balance sheet. Both companies will have the resources and talent for new growth and profitability. Both companies will have outstanding leadership teams and be market leaders. 
In sum, separating the businesses should generate greater opportunities and allow shareholders to better understand both companies' underlying value, strategy and competitive strengths. We ask your patience. Work has just begun on this transaction, and we have not yet filed a Form 10 SEC Registration Statement, although we expect to do so sometime late in the second quarter. Until then, we won't be able to provide more financial details. 
For more about the business, I've asked Steve Weisz, the future CEO of the new Timeshare company, to talk to you a bit about MVCI's prospects. A 37-year Marriott veteran, Steve is a tremendous leader, understands this business very well and has done an outstanding job in his almost 14 years at the MVCI helm. Steve?"

Marriott entered the Timeshare business in 1984 with the acquisition of American Resorts, a small Florida company with a handful of resorts on Hilton Head Island. Since then, the business has grown. In 2010 alone as part of Marriott, segment revenues totaled over $1.5 billion, and segment pretax earnings totaled over $120 million. This is a successful, profitable business with an outstanding future. 
Today, we have the most resorts in the upscale Timeshare business, and customers simply love our product. Our 71-resort system offers high-quality, purpose-built resorts in desirable locations and a variety of usage options. Following these transactions, owners and guests should see no change in the branding or quality of their properties, services, usage options, use of Marriott Rewards Points or access to Marriott International hotels. And following the split, all of us at both companies will remain committed to delivering outstanding product and vacation experiences.  
While we aren't naming the new company today, we know that when we do, it will include the name Marriott because of the tremendous competitive advantage the name conveys. In fact, we will have the exclusive rights to both the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott names as they apply to the Timeshare business under a long-term agreement, for which we will pay a franchise fee to Marriott. At the same time, we will also be able to develop and operate Timeshare resorts under other brand names. 
All of us here are products of Marriott's deep-rooted corporate culture, which recognizes that we take care of the associate who takes care of the guest, and the guest returns. This will remain at the core of our new company's culture, and we believe the transaction will enable even more associate career opportunities in the future. 
Bill Shaw, who is retiring as Vice Chairman of Marriott at the end of March, will become Chairman of the Board of our new public Timeshare company. Bill's strong leadership, business and finance acumen and core belief in Marriott culture will serve our public shareholders well. Debbie Marriott Harrison, Mr. Marriott's daughter, will also serve on our Board of Directors. The Timeshare business is highly regulated, and Debbie's experience in corporate affairs at Marriott International makes her a great addition to the board. 
We see a bright future for this new company. Our new Points product has been very well received by customers. Timeshare demand correlates highly with consumer confidence, which is coming back. New construction starts in the Timeshare industry are very low as the industry continues to absorb existing inventory. In fact, at year-end 2010, we had $1.5 billion in Timeshare inventory on the books, including over $730 million in finished goods, which should help minimize near-term cash needs. 
Looking further ahead, while we don't expect the new company to be investment-grade in the near term, we do expect that it will continue to securitize its consumer notes receivable and should require little additional incremental capital. We believe we will have the economic strength and flexibility to weather further economic cycles as well as grow over time. 
Our overhead is in excellent shape. All-in-all, we believe our operating leverage at this stage of the recovery is a tremendous positive for the business. We expect the company will remain well balanced, with income coming from development, Timeshare resort management and the consumer financing business. 
In 1984, Marriott blazed new trails in the Timeshare industry with the introduction of the gold-plated Marriott brand. Today, the company is breaking new ground again by presenting investors with the opportunity to invest in a stand-alone, well-branded Timeshare company. I'm confident that we'll all look back on this as a defining moment, not only for Marriott Vacation Club International but for the entire Timeshare industry as well. 
And now to talk about the results of the rest of the company, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist."

We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. Our Lodging business",911,"Thanks, Steve. Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. 
Our Lodging business reported stronger-than-expected REVPAR and margins, which accounted for about $0.03 of the outperformance. Timeshare's contract sales exceeded the high end of expectations, but profits were depressed by about $0.01 due to impairments for a few fractional projects due to slow sales pace. 
Fourth quarter adjusted G&A was higher than we estimated, with about $0.02 due to higher than expected owner workouts and about $0.01 in new infrastructure spending to drive growth in our international markets. Below the line, stronger than expected cash flow saved $0.01 on net interest expense. And on the tax line, we picked up about $0.03 due to certain revisions to prior year's estimated foreign tax expense and about $0.01 due to lower full year tax rates associated with the growth in our international operations. 
We adjusted our fourth quarter results for several unusual items, including an $84 million impairment charge associated with our consolidated inventory total yield system or CITY. CITY is a groundbreaking revenue management system that will provide our hotels the tools to yield manage group demand, including guest rooms, function space and catering. Marriott funded the upfront cost of CITY because of its significant potential to enhance our brand, increase competitive advantage and drive hotel profitability. 
We made the investment as we've made systems investments in the past, with the expectation that we would recover our cost over time from participating hotels. But the significant impact of the recent financial crisis and recession on owner and franchisee profitability occurred simultaneously with the scheduled system rollout and the beginning of the cost-recovery process. Given this, along with the long-term nature of our relationships with our owners and franchisees, we agreed to absorb part of the cost of this system. 
System-wide worldwide REVPAR rose 8% in the fourth quarter. In our North American Lodging business, corporate transient business was very strong. For the company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, REVPAR for our premium, corporate and above business rose 17%, with 9% coming from average daily rates. We continue to press retail rates higher. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of company-operated Marriott-branded hotels in North America raised retail rates, and one in four raised rates more than 16%. 
Our limited-service hotels saw the impact of stronger business demand, particularly in the urban markets. Limited-service system-wide North American REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. For company-operated Marriott hotels in North America, special corporate room nights increased 16% during the quarter. 
We're roughly 2/3 of the way done with special corporate rate negotiations for 2011, and the resulting rates for the completed accounts are running up at a high single-digit rate over 2010 prices. Special corporate customers also tell us that they expect to be traveling more in 2011. 
Now while still lagging the transient recovery, group business continues to improve with significant short-term demand. The booking window has not lengthened, but we are already seeing price improvement. For company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts, December group room rates rose nearly 5%, and new group bookings made in the 2010 fourth quarter for 2011 were up 21%, including 11% higher room rate. In fact, we booked nearly $150 million of 2011 group business in the fourth quarter alone. 
Turning to development. We opened over 150 new properties in 2010, with nearly 30,000 rooms. At year end, our pipeline increased to nearly 105,000 rooms worldwide, with roughly 45,000 rooms in international markets. Roughly 35% of our pipeline rooms were under construction, and nearly 20% are awaiting conversion. 
For 2011, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase 17% to 26%, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to climb 12% to 18% for the full year. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.24 to $0.28 per share, assuming a 7% to 9% worldwide system-wide REVPAR increase. The first quarter reflects slower growth than the full year, largely due to timing issues for G&A and Timeshare. The first quarter 2011 G&A increase reflects a tough comparison to a $6 million guarantee reserve reversal and unusually low incentive compensation in the prior-year quarter. 
For Timeshare, lower interest income and rental profits will likely depress results in the first quarter, but favorable development profit reportability and solid cost controls should yield much stronger earnings in the remainder of the year. We haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is, unadjusted pro forma changes for incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Total investment spending in 2010 was about $400 million. We will be disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases but expect to return cash to shareholders if attractive investment opportunities do not appear. 
2010 was a turning point for Marriott's Lodging and Timeshare business. We are uniquely positioned with the largest portfolio of very strong brands, a sizable unit growth pipeline and significant near-term free cash flow. We're all looking forward to an exciting 2011. Melissa, we're pleased to take the questions now."

So the two biggest investments we made in 2010, and they will probably be the two biggest that are in Carl's $500 million to $700 million of forecasted investment spending, are the acquisitions we made of the Seville Hotel in Miami Beach and the Berners in London, both of which will be converted to EDITION Hotels after substantial reconstruction of those assets. At the beginning of 2010, we didn't know about either of those and wouldn't have forecasted either of them. So we found them to be pretty compelling options for us, and we jumped at them. As we look into 2011, particularly as it relates to your question about international growth, I think the places where it's mostly likely that we might invest would be things like the Fairfield rollout in India or the Fairfield rollout in Brazil, where we are in discussions with a number of equity partners about possibly taking the minority equity stake in some of those. But if we could do that to roll out a few dozen hotels, we might put some tens of millions of dollars I suppose anyway to work over time. How much of that actually goes out the door in 2011 is still an open question because if we were to ink definitive deals today, it might still be a number of months before construction actually started, which is where the spending is mostly going to happen. And then I think as you'll recall from our Analyst Day in October, we have assumptions in the multiyear model that we might find a couple of full-service hotels per year to acquire with the notion of converting to our brand and reselling. That is obviously going to be driven by the market in both availability of deals, attractiveness of pricing and whether or not, in fact, our partners are stepping in to buy those assets, saving us the need to take a position in them at any time."

The other thing is that the segment has over $1.5 billion worth of inventory, as Steve mentioned, of which about $730 million of that is finished units. So you got a long runway of inventory so to speak, that you can sell up to get a couple years going there. The long-term view, though, as I think you would be right that as the company grows, they would approach the capital market. How that approach occurs probably waits to be seen. But clearly, it's going to be a growth vehicle. And as a growth vehicle, it will approach capital markets to grow."

Philosophically, we know some things already. We know that the securitization debt will go with the Timeshare company. As your question suggests, it's absolutely right, we would expect the Timeshare company to be adequately capitalized but not investment-grade. It would, in all likelihood, have a lower credit rating agency – a credit rating than Marriott International would. When you talk about Marriott International over time, it is certainly possible to run this model to get us debt-free in a relatively short period of time. That's not the way we will manage the business. I mean, we have long had a debt-to-EBITDA target around 3x. We ended 2010 with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-EBITDA of about 2.5x. And in a sense, that shows your question at work. If we don't put much money out the door, the debt goes down quickly. We would anticipate over time, though, that we would continue to put investment-grade, solid investment-grade leverage on the company and use those resources, as Carl talked about before, either to invest in our business or to return to shareholders. And with that, maybe John, you can just talk about the kinds of facilities you anticipate."

I think there are a couple of things that are important to us as we go forward. One end, the most fundamental is that the Marriott Timeshare company must be economically viable and be structured in a way that it can withstand cycles. It can have access to capital markets and in no way that is it in peril. Obviously, it's in not just that company's interest but Marriott International's interest to make sure that it is a growth partner and a healthy one. And so that's going to be an important litmus test for setting those fees. The second is we'll want a fee structure that is an appropriate incentive for this business to grow with us. And obviously, if we put a fee that is too high on their sales that potentially cause them to say, ""We're giving up too big a share of our profits for those,"" we're going to tend to run that business away from us sooner rather than later, and we basically never want to run that business away from us. And those will be important philosophical guide posts in the way we structure it. You’re still going to have to wait for that Form 10, though, to see what the levels of those fees are.

It's about whether or not there are investment opportunities that exceed our cost of capital comfortably so that we can create value. I think through the fullness of cycles, it has been more often the case than not that we have failed to find enough opportunities to invest in our business and create value, enough that would consume all of our investment capacity. And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at it. So as Carl talked about with $500 million to $700 billion of investment spending in our guidance, we think with appropriate leverage, that leaves us $1 billion or so of additional capital that can be invested or returned to shareholders.

Welcome to our Year End 2010 Earnings Conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and; Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
We're conducting our call today from the headquarters of Marriott Vacation Club International in sunny, warm Orlando, Florida. We discussed our plans to divide the company with our Vacation Club associates last night in a town hall meeting after we issued our press release. There is still a lot to be done but we're all quite excited by this terrific opportunity. So on today's call, we also have joining us our host here in Florida, Steve Weisz, President of Marriott Vacation Club International; John Geller, Chief Financial Officer of our current and future Timeshare business; as well as Bill Shaw, Vice Chairman of the company. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 15, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find definitions of the terms we referred to this morning in our earnings release on Page 16. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
We wanted to have an extended discussion of our major brand initiatives, but we have too much other ground to cover. 2010 was a stellar year for Marriott. REVPAR was outstanding. Pricing turned up faster than many expected. And we reached our leverage targets. Now solidly investment grade, we resumed share repurchases in the 2010 fourth quarter. With significant leverage to the improving operating environment, our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% in 2010 and 22% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, 11% excluding the impact of securitizations. 
We made significant progress growing our brands, opening almost 30,000 new rooms in 2010. We opened our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, and we announced two new brands, AC Hotels by Marriott, a growth vehicle for Europe and Latin America; and Autograph, a collection of independent and unique four- and five-star hotels. 
Autograph launched in January of 2010 and by year end, already have 13 hotels operating including the spectacular Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. With nearly 4,000 Autograph rooms added in less than a year, we could not be more pleased with the speed of the launch and the economics of the brand. The first seven Autograph hotels saw their REVPAR index grow by over 20 percentage points in the second half of 2010. These brands already resonate with owners and guests. 
Our other brands didn't stand still. Owners and franchisees invested in great rooms and our full-service brands, a very successful refreshing business public space in Courtyard and new designs for residents in SpringHill Suites and Fairfield Inn & Suites. We continue to seize growth opportunities in big emerging markets. In China, we have the best portfolio of luxurious city center properties, typically carrying the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Marriott and Renaissance brands. In gateway markets like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, our portfolio of hotels are second to none in quality or number. 
While our growth with these brands will continue in 2010, we stepped up our efforts by also expanding our moderate-tier platforms. In India, we announced the rollout of Fairfield by Marriott, a product specifically designed for that market. And in Brazil, we announced plans to open 50 new Fairfield Hotels with their own environmentally-friendly design. 
Our Timeshare business had a great 2010, rolling out the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Points Program to great success, providing owners with greater flexibility and choice. And the business continued to right-size its overhead as well as its sales and marketing costs. And for Timeshare, bigger changes are in the offing. Last night, as you know, we announced a plan to divide the company's Lodging and Timeshare businesses into two separate publicly traded companies through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders. While many of you might first think this is Marriott International exiting the Timeshare business, we do not view it that way. We see it as setting up a platform for the Timeshare business still linked to the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands to grow faster with independent capitalization but still adding loyal Marriott customers as they grow. 
We frequently talk about the tremendous growth opportunities in both our Lodging and Timeshare businesses. So as we roll out this transaction, many may ask, ""Why do this?"" Simply put, we believe the two businesses appeal to different types of investors with different investment goals and risk profiles. Finding investors who want to invest in both industries together is more challenging than finding investors for each individually. We faced a similar challenge years ago as investors in our Lodging brand business were much less interested in lodging real estate. 
In the early 1990s, we resolved it with a spinoff, which yielded two separate companies: Marriott International and Host Marriott, which, of course, is now today's Host Hotels & Resorts. Today, over 99% of the hotels in our system are owned by others, including a substantial number owned by real estate investment trusts. Many investors have told us that they like to specialize, concentrating on businesses with one core focus that they can understand and can value. Such specialization has largely not occurred in the Timeshare business until now. So why do this now? The transaction will create the largest pure-play Timeshare company in the world, a platform that will leverage the finest lodging brands around, our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, and allow them to continue to grow in this space. 
The past three years were difficult for the Timeshare industry. The consumer was hit hard in the recession and our sales felt the impact. During this time, our priorities were to right-size the business and maximize cash flow while also launching our new Points product. In these past three years, there was little need for us to invest incremental capital in the business. 
Today, our Timeshare Points Program is off to a great start. The business has proved its ability to drive cash flow even in an extraordinarily difficult market. And while the business is still rich with inventory, as the recovery progresses, opportunities for new investments will emerge. By spinning this business off, we are setting it up to be able to make those new investments and grow. 
At the same time, from this transaction will also emerge a lodging brand company even more focused on its core business of generating management and franchise fees. Marriott International will still create value in the Timeshare business but through its brand equity rather than its balance sheet. Both companies will have the resources and talent for new growth and profitability. Both companies will have outstanding leadership teams and be market leaders. 
In sum, separating the businesses should generate greater opportunities and allow shareholders to better understand both companies' underlying value, strategy and competitive strengths. We ask your patience. Work has just begun on this transaction, and we have not yet filed a Form 10 SEC Registration Statement, although we expect to do so sometime late in the second quarter. Until then, we won't be able to provide more financial details. 
For more about the business, I've asked Steve Weisz, the future CEO of the new Timeshare company, to talk to you a bit about MVCI's prospects. A 37-year Marriott veteran, Steve is a tremendous leader, understands this business very well and has done an outstanding job in his almost 14 years at the MVCI helm. Steve?"

Marriott entered the Timeshare business in 1984 with the acquisition of American Resorts, a small Florida company with a handful of resorts on Hilton Head Island. Since then, the business has grown. In 2010 alone as part of Marriott, segment revenues totaled over $1.5 billion, and segment pretax earnings totaled over $120 million. This is a successful, profitable business with an outstanding future. 
Today, we have the most resorts in the upscale Timeshare business, and customers simply love our product. Our 71-resort system offers high-quality, purpose-built resorts in desirable locations and a variety of usage options. Following these transactions, owners and guests should see no change in the branding or quality of their properties, services, usage options, use of Marriott Rewards Points or access to Marriott International hotels. And following the split, all of us at both companies will remain committed to delivering outstanding product and vacation experiences.  
While we aren't naming the new company today, we know that when we do, it will include the name Marriott because of the tremendous competitive advantage the name conveys. In fact, we will have the exclusive rights to both the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott names as they apply to the Timeshare business under a long-term agreement, for which we will pay a franchise fee to Marriott. At the same time, we will also be able to develop and operate Timeshare resorts under other brand names. 
All of us here are products of Marriott's deep-rooted corporate culture, which recognizes that we take care of the associate who takes care of the guest, and the guest returns. This will remain at the core of our new company's culture, and we believe the transaction will enable even more associate career opportunities in the future. 
Bill Shaw, who is retiring as Vice Chairman of Marriott at the end of March, will become Chairman of the Board of our new public Timeshare company. Bill's strong leadership, business and finance acumen and core belief in Marriott culture will serve our public shareholders well. Debbie Marriott Harrison, Mr. Marriott's daughter, will also serve on our Board of Directors. The Timeshare business is highly regulated, and Debbie's experience in corporate affairs at Marriott International makes her a great addition to the board. 
We see a bright future for this new company. Our new Points product has been very well received by customers. Timeshare demand correlates highly with consumer confidence, which is coming back. New construction starts in the Timeshare industry are very low as the industry continues to absorb existing inventory. In fact, at year-end 2010, we had $1.5 billion in Timeshare inventory on the books, including over $730 million in finished goods, which should help minimize near-term cash needs. 
Looking further ahead, while we don't expect the new company to be investment-grade in the near term, we do expect that it will continue to securitize its consumer notes receivable and should require little additional incremental capital. We believe we will have the economic strength and flexibility to weather further economic cycles as well as grow over time. 
Our overhead is in excellent shape. All-in-all, we believe our operating leverage at this stage of the recovery is a tremendous positive for the business. We expect the company will remain well balanced, with income coming from development, Timeshare resort management and the consumer financing business. 
In 1984, Marriott blazed new trails in the Timeshare industry with the introduction of the gold-plated Marriott brand. Today, the company is breaking new ground again by presenting investors with the opportunity to invest in a stand-alone, well-branded Timeshare company. I'm confident that we'll all look back on this as a defining moment, not only for Marriott Vacation Club International but for the entire Timeshare industry as well. 
And now to talk about the results of the rest of the company, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist."

Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. Our Lodging business",911,"Thanks, Steve. Well, we had a pretty terrific fourth quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, a 22% increase from prior year and $0.04 to $0.05 better than our October guidance. 
Our Lodging business reported stronger-than-expected REVPAR and margins, which accounted for about $0.03 of the outperformance. Timeshare's contract sales exceeded the high end of expectations, but profits were depressed by about $0.01 due to impairments for a few fractional projects due to slow sales pace. 
Fourth quarter adjusted G&A was higher than we estimated, with about $0.02 due to higher than expected owner workouts and about $0.01 in new infrastructure spending to drive growth in our international markets. Below the line, stronger than expected cash flow saved $0.01 on net interest expense. And on the tax line, we picked up about $0.03 due to certain revisions to prior year's estimated foreign tax expense and about $0.01 due to lower full year tax rates associated with the growth in our international operations. 
We adjusted our fourth quarter results for several unusual items, including an $84 million impairment charge associated with our consolidated inventory total yield system or CITY. CITY is a groundbreaking revenue management system that will provide our hotels the tools to yield manage group demand, including guest rooms, function space and catering. Marriott funded the upfront cost of CITY because of its significant potential to enhance our brand, increase competitive advantage and drive hotel profitability. 
We made the investment as we've made systems investments in the past, with the expectation that we would recover our cost over time from participating hotels. But the significant impact of the recent financial crisis and recession on owner and franchisee profitability occurred simultaneously with the scheduled system rollout and the beginning of the cost-recovery process. Given this, along with the long-term nature of our relationships with our owners and franchisees, we agreed to absorb part of the cost of this system. 
System-wide worldwide REVPAR rose 8% in the fourth quarter. In our North American Lodging business, corporate transient business was very strong. For the company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, REVPAR for our premium, corporate and above business rose 17%, with 9% coming from average daily rates. We continue to press retail rates higher. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of company-operated Marriott-branded hotels in North America raised retail rates, and one in four raised rates more than 16%. 
Our limited-service hotels saw the impact of stronger business demand, particularly in the urban markets. Limited-service system-wide North American REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. For company-operated Marriott hotels in North America, special corporate room nights increased 16% during the quarter. 
We're roughly 2/3 of the way done with special corporate rate negotiations for 2011, and the resulting rates for the completed accounts are running up at a high single-digit rate over 2010 prices. Special corporate customers also tell us that they expect to be traveling more in 2011. 
Now while still lagging the transient recovery, group business continues to improve with significant short-term demand. The booking window has not lengthened, but we are already seeing price improvement. For company-managed Marriott Hotels & Resorts, December group room rates rose nearly 5%, and new group bookings made in the 2010 fourth quarter for 2011 were up 21%, including 11% higher room rate. In fact, we booked nearly $150 million of 2011 group business in the fourth quarter alone. 
Turning to development. We opened over 150 new properties in 2010, with nearly 30,000 rooms. At year end, our pipeline increased to nearly 105,000 rooms worldwide, with roughly 45,000 rooms in international markets. Roughly 35% of our pipeline rooms were under construction, and nearly 20% are awaiting conversion. 
For 2011, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase 17% to 26%, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to climb 12% to 18% for the full year. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.24 to $0.28 per share, assuming a 7% to 9% worldwide system-wide REVPAR increase. The first quarter reflects slower growth than the full year, largely due to timing issues for G&A and Timeshare. The first quarter 2011 G&A increase reflects a tough comparison to a $6 million guarantee reserve reversal and unusually low incentive compensation in the prior-year quarter. 
For Timeshare, lower interest income and rental profits will likely depress results in the first quarter, but favorable development profit reportability and solid cost controls should yield much stronger earnings in the remainder of the year. We haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is, unadjusted pro forma changes for incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Total investment spending in 2010 was about $400 million. We will be disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases but expect to return cash to shareholders if attractive investment opportunities do not appear. 
2010 was a turning point for Marriott's Lodging and Timeshare business. We are uniquely positioned with the largest portfolio of very strong brands, a sizable unit growth pipeline and significant near-term free cash flow. We're all looking forward to an exciting 2011. Melissa, we're pleased to take the questions now."

So the two biggest investments we made in 2010, and they will probably be the two biggest that are in Carl's $500 million to $700 million of forecasted investment spending, are the acquisitions we made of the Seville Hotel in Miami Beach and the Berners in London, both of which will be converted to EDITION Hotels after substantial reconstruction of those assets. At the beginning of 2010, we didn't know about either of those and wouldn't have forecasted either of them. So we found them to be pretty compelling options for us, and we jumped at them. As we look into 2011, particularly as it relates to your question about international growth, I think the places where it's mostly likely that we might invest would be things like the Fairfield rollout in India or the Fairfield rollout in Brazil, where we are in discussions with a number of equity partners about possibly taking the minority equity stake in some of those. But if we could do that to roll out a few dozen hotels, we might put some tens of millions of dollars I suppose anyway to work over time. How much of that actually goes out the door in 2011 is still an open question because if we were to ink definitive deals today, it might still be a number of months before construction actually started, which is where the spending is mostly going to happen. And then I think as you'll recall from our Analyst Day in October, we have assumptions in the multiyear model that we might find a couple of full-service hotels per year to acquire with the notion of converting to our brand and reselling. That is obviously going to be driven by the market in both availability of deals, attractiveness of pricing and whether or not, in fact, our partners are stepping in to buy those assets, saving us the need to take a position in them at any time."

The other thing is that the segment has over $1.5 billion worth of inventory, as Steve mentioned, of which about $730 million of that is finished units. So you got a long runway of inventory so to speak, that you can sell up to get a couple years going there.

Philosophically, we know some things already. We know that the securitization debt will go with the Timeshare company. As your question suggests, it's absolutely right, we would expect the Timeshare company to be adequately capitalized but not investment-grade. It would, in all likelihood, have a lower credit rating agency – a credit rating than Marriott International would. When you talk about Marriott International over time, it is certainly possible to run this model to get us debt-free in a relatively short period of time. That's not the way we will manage the business. I mean, we have long had a debt-to-EBITDA target around 3x. We ended 2010 with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-EBITDA of about 2.5x. And in a sense, that shows your question at work. If we don't put much money out the door, the debt goes down quickly. We would anticipate over time, though, that we would continue to put investment-grade, solid investment-grade leverage on the company and use those resources, as Carl talked about before, either to invest in our business or to return to shareholders.

Let me just suggest that what we've tried to do over the last several years as the economy has gone through a few bumps is to make sure that we have been prudent in the way in which we deploy capital in terms of fueling growth, as has already been mentioned. Obviously, we have a surplus of inventory at this point in time, but we hope that will start to come down quite nicely as the economy picks up some steam. I think as you start to look forward as an independent company, we'll clearly be trying to develop a strategy that will reflect what we think is going to be happening in the future.

And so we’ve pushed that aggressively and deliberately. That's where we're going to continue to make sure we've got significant efforts focused so that's what the corporate negotiations have been about. Carl had some statistics about rate growth in the group bookings that were put on the books in the fourth quarter. And we'll stay as keenly focused on that as we possibly can. Beyond that, it's going to be every element of the expense line, and that's true from the property level all the way up through corporate to make sure that we're driving as much of that through as we possibly can. While we have already started to experience substantial recovery, we've got owners who remain under significant pressure, and we've got to make sure that we're driving as much of that incremental revenue through to the bottom line as we can.

And so that's going to be an important litmus test for setting those fees. The second is we'll want a fee structure that is an appropriate incentive for this business to grow with us. And obviously, if we put a fee that is too high on their sales that potentially cause them to say, ""We're giving up too big a share of our profits for those,"" we're going to tend to run that business away from us sooner rather than later, and we basically never want to run that business away from us.

And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at it.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorensen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Daum, Seni",2088,"Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorensen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Daum, Senior Director, Investor Relations. As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Security laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 21, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. So let's get started. 
In the first quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.26, an 18% increase from prior year and consistent with our $0.24 to $0.28 February guidance. For our first fiscal quarter, system-wide worldwide REVPAR rose 6.5%. In North America, systemwide REVPAR increased 5.8%, just short of our 6% to 8% guidance. If calculated on the basis of the calendar quarter, our North American systemwide REVPAR would have been up 6.8%, a full percentage point higher. 
With strong demand and limited supply growth, most markets in the U.S. reported significant REVPAR growth. In contrast, Washington D.C. was weak, reflecting a significantly shortened congressional calendar, lower government per diem and the lingering threat of a government shutdown. With the recent budget settlement, business is already improving in D.C. New supply in New York also put pressure on REVPAR, although strong demand kept REVPAR growth in positive territory. 
Across the U.S., the Marriott brand in the quarter for the quarter, group business was weaker than expected but at the same time, new group bookings made in the first quarter for later in 2011 were strong, up about 10% year-over-year. We believe our first quarter group business shortfall was an anomaly rather than the start of a trend. 
After reviewing our results, one might ask why was our first quarter REVPAR growth lower than the Smith Travel? Much of the difference is due to different calendar period as I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have a significant concentration of hotels in Washington where first quarter demand was weak. Systemwide, one in 20 of our domestic hotels are in the greater Washington market, 2.5x the industry's distribution. Our exposure to group business is also considerably higher than the typical Smith Travel hotel. The average company-operated Marriott brand hotel in the U.S. is merely 45% larger than the average upper upscale Smith Travel hotel, about 40% larger than the typical Sheraton and 25% larger than the typical Hilton. And larger hotels have higher group mix. Since group business tends to lag in an economic recovery, REVPAR improvement in our group hotels will likely lag as well. 
Another difference from Smith Travel and most of our competitors is that Marriott reports REVPAR results on a comparable store basis, not a same-store basis. We exclude hotels from our REVPAR statistics that are impacted for the full year by meaningful renovations. On a same-store basis, renovations can hurt REVPAR when construction is underway but can yield outside year-over-year gains when construction is complete. We choose to use comparable statistics to remove this volatility and give a more accurate measure of system performance and demand trends. Of course, sometimes renovations are too small to make a hotel non-comp for the full year but still big enough to impact REVPAR results in a given quarter. The renovation of meeting space and a small portion of the guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott downtown reduced REVPAR growth for the North American company-operated Marriott brand by about a half a percentage point alone. This property remained in our comp base because of renovation be largely complete midyear. 
Renovations of Courtyard lobbies also still in our comp base, reduced Courtyard company-operated REVPAR by about one percentage point as 47 properties under renovation this year compared to 30 hotels in the year ago quarter as some has speculated that we might be overpriced. We've looked at our pricing trends in the first quarter and feel that we're right on track. We continually evaluate our pricing relative to competitors and market dynamics. Without a doubt, Marriott led the way on price increases in 2010. Today, however, competitors are raising rates as well. Based on our market reviews, we are not overpriced. 
Outside North America, constant dollar REVPAR for comparable systemwide hotels rose 11.2% in the quarter. Demand was very strong in Europe, Latin America and most of Asia but understandably weak in the Middle East and Japan. House profit margins for our worldwide company-operated properties increased 30 basis points during the quarter, and house profit per available room rose over 6%. 
International Hotels benefited from very strong REVPAR growth, while the 30 basis point decline in North American margins was largely related to the impact of the New Year's holiday in this year's fiscal quarter when it was excluded from the year ago quarter. U.S. margins were also hurt by higher state unemployment tax rates, higher sales and marketing costs and timing of property-level bonus accruals. 
We expect domestic house profit margins will increase 100 to 150 basis points, and international house profit margins will increase about 100 basis points for the full year. Globally, fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter, including a 5% increase in incentive fees in this seasonally slow quarter. Owned, leased and corporate housing and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 67%, reflecting much stronger results from our owned and leased hotels in Germany, the U.K. and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. 
Results also benefited from the impact of converting our hotel from leased to managed. Results from our leased Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Japan declined $2 million alone in the quarter. Branding fees associated with our corporate credit card were strong in the first quarter. 
General and administrative expenses rose 15%, consistent with our guidance, reflecting expenses associated with growth in international markets, higher brand investment, higher accruals for incentive compensation and tough comparisons to favorable items in the prior year's quarter. Last year's G&A included the benefit of $6 million of guarantee reserve reversals and $2 million from collection of a receivable previously reserved. Given that much of the increase in the first quarter G&A were due to non-comparable items in the prior year, we expect the year-over-year increases in G&A to moderate later in the year. 
For our Timeshare business, first quarter contract sales were consistent with expectations. Timeshare's segment earnings exceeded expectations due to favorable reportability. Our sales force continued to sign up existing owners to our new points product, and our average contract value continues to build. 
We launched some special promotions near the end of the quarter to accelerate sales and expect better segment earnings for the full year than previously guided in February. 
Now we are on track with our Timeshare spin-off transaction. We have forwarded our request for a Private Letter Rolling to the IRS, and we are in the process of arranging bank financing for the new company. The Form 10 is underway, and we expect to file with the SEC in June. We currently expect the Timeshare business to pay a franchise fee to Marriott, totaling approximately 2% of developer contract sales plus a flat $50 million annually for the use of our brand. A flat fee would increase periodically by an inflation adjustment. 
At the end of the first quarter, the Timeshare segment had $3.2 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion of inventory and nearly $950 million of securitized debt so the spin-off will have a significant favorable impact on our balance sheet. More financial information about the new company will be in the Form 10. All in all, we are on track and confident that we will be able to close this transaction later this year. 
Turning to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the first quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a tough comp for our Shanghai hotels later this year. For our 31 hotels in the Middle East and 10 hotels in Japan, we expect REVPAR to remain weak, although we also expect modest improvement over the current levels later this year. 
As a result, for the second quarter and the full year, we expect international REVPAR growth to total 5% to 7%. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, we expect international REVPAR will increase by 8% to 10% in the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full year. 
Today, we have significant group business on the books for 2011 and special corporate rate negotiations are complete, with rates increasing consistent with our expectation. We see strength in Transient business demand and continue to estimate 6% to 8% REVPAR growth for our North American systemwide hotels for the second quarter and the full year. 
Now let's take a look at the P&L. Compared to our full year guidance in February, today, we expect our fees in Asia will be better than earlier anticipated but will be more than offset by weakness in the Middle East. On the owned, leased and other line, we expect to benefit from stronger performance among our European owned and leased hotels, as well as a higher termination fee, while we also expect a $10 million decline in profits from Japan. 
Our full year outlook for G&A expense is up a bit, reflecting higher legal expenses, some prior year bonus true-ups and a delay in the favorable recognition of a completion guarantee. In the second quarter, we expect G&A will be impacted by higher costs in the international markets, as well as higher workouts and legal costs. 
Interest income for the full year is likely to be a bit lower than we anticipated as we expect we will be repaid early on an outstanding loan. Our share count is coming down quickly as we continue to take advantage of recent share price weakness to repurchase shares. 
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 100 properties with over 14,000 rooms. At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled over 95,000 rooms worldwide, with nearly 39,000 rooms in international markets. Just as many hotel companies take different approaches to measuring REVPAR growth, you'll find different approaches to measuring development pipelines. We take a conservative approach so you can be sure we have even more deals in the works than are reflected in our 95,000 rooms. But because of our approach, our accuracy in predicting unit openings has been quite high. For example, at year end 2006, our pipeline totaled 100,000 rooms, and over the next three years, we actually added just over 100,000 new rooms. 
Looking ahead, with the growing proportion of room additions coming from conversions and last-minute new unit flaggings, we believe our actual openings over the next three years are very likely to exceed today's pipeline. Today, nearly 40% of our pipeline rooms are under construction and over 10% are awaiting conversion. We completed the purchase of a 50% interest in the AC Hotel joint venture during the first quarter, which added over 7,000 rooms to our system. We expect to add another 1,700 AC rooms in the second quarter. We plan to launch the AC Hotels by Marriott brands on all our booking channels next month. 
For 2011, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 26% over the prior-year adjusted EPS, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide systemwide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 11% to 16% compared to last year's adjusted amount. 
Now we haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is, unadjusted for pro forma changes or incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We repurchased over 13 million shares for nearly $500 million year-to-date through this week, and we expect to remain aggressive given our recent stock price and substantial excess debt capacity. So with that, I will turn over to Arne."

We made some news at the recent JPMorgan Lodging Conference when we pre-announced our first quarter REVPAR trends. At the time, we didn't have the opportunity to explain in depth what we were seeing. While in a perfect world, we would've preferred to wait until this call so that we have more time to give you a full explanation, we believe that investors deserve to know what we knew in a timely manner. We did not like the idea of participating in such a significant conference and having investors leave there expecting us to meet our REVPAR target when we believed that was unlikely. 
Unfortunately, as is often the case when full information is lacking, there were some who stepped in to speculate. Frankly, I was mystified by some of the conclusions. First, let's begin with market share. Occasionally, you'll hear someone represent recent REVPAR growth rates as a proxy for market share. It goes something like this: If brand A grows REVPAR by 8% and brand B grows REVPAR by 5%, then brand A must be taking 300 basis points of share. This is so superficial as to be meaningless. REVPAR growth statistics alone say little about market share. As Carl discussed earlier, different geographic concentrations, group concentrations and timing of renovations can have a material impact on REVPAR growth without a material impact on market share. 
Similarly, nonsensical is the statement that a brand is taking market share if its average index is higher as a result of deleting its worst-performing hotels. Such a higher average index is mapped, not a result of any movement in market share. 
So let's talk about REVPAR index. REVPAR index is compiled by Smith Travel Research and compares the absolute REVPAR of a particular hotel to the average REVPAR of its specific competitors in the same market. It's not a perfect measure as the results can vary based on the selection of the hotels on a competitive set and it doesn't identify performance of specific competitors but it's the only way we have to evaluate an individual hotel's market share. If the data shows a meaningful change in index, we look for an underlying cause. Sometimes, the property's coming out of a renovation. Sometimes new suppliers enter the market, and sometimes, it's simply the economic cycle. 
In an economic decline, stronger brands frequently increase their index as customers are able to find more than typical availability at their favorite hotel. In an economic upturn, on the other hand, weaker brands tend to take share as customers are shut out of their favorite properties as sell out nice increase. Further, hotels with greater group concentration tend to show increasing REVPAR index in weak economic climates when group business hold up better than transient. But in strengthening economies, hotels with greater group concentrations lag the market as they can't price up as quickly as transient properties. 
While REVPAR index can vary considerably from month to month and business cycle to business cycle, each of our brands has a very strong REVPAR index. Our high index reflects our strong locations, quality products, extensive distribution, popular frequent traveler program, easy-to-use reservation channels and of course, outstanding service both on and off property. While we're not the only company to do well across many of these measures, in our opinion, none of our competitors do as well as Marriott across so many programs, across so many markets and across so many brands. 
The performance of our newest brand, Autograph, is revealing. In 2010, we had a collection of a dozen beautiful mature and well-run hotels to the new Autograph collection, plugging them in to the Marriott reservation system, frequent traveler program and Back at the House system. While REVPAR index data is only available through February, for the months of December, January and February, the 12 hotels increased REVPAR by 17% and increased REVPAR index by 11 points. By the way, this significant increase is not reflected in this quarter's REVPAR growth rate because these hotels were not in our system in early 2010 and therefore, we do not view them as comp hotels even though obviously, we know how they performed a year ago. 
The bottom line performance of these hotels was even more impressive as they also paid a lot less in booking to those reservations. Our brands and systems have delivered amazing value for these new owners. So how is the Marriott brand REVPAR index doing? After adjusting for the renovation impact at just two large hotels, REVPAR index of our company-operated North America Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand hotels was flat in the three months ending in February, flat in February year-to-date and flat in February alone. This is gratifying because given our heavy mix of group business, we would not have been surprised to see our REVPAR index decline at this point in the economic cycle. 
Looking over a longer period of time to capture both sides of the economic cycle, REVPAR index for the Marriott brand rose 1.6 percentage points over the last two years and 2.8 percentage points over the last three years. After evaluating all of the data, we conclude our brands are doing very well compared to our competitors. Our customer satisfaction scores remain high, and our customers remain very loyal. 
Now speaking of our customers. Over half of the occupancy in our hotels is touched by direct sales, largely through group meeting planners, corporate travel managers and other intermediaries. Several years ago, these customers told us that they wanted to deal with sales people who understood and could sell all of our brands, meeting all of our business needs, including group business travel and extended stay. We listened and beginning in 2007, started rolling out sales transformation in the U.S., organizing our sales executives to be customer-centric rather than property-centric. By reducing the number of property sales calls made to the same customer, we are calling on many times more customers. That is, more sales calls, to corporations, to associations, to religious organizations, even to sports teams. And while our sales staff at very large properties remain on property, we are booking most medium-sized group meetings, defined as 100 to 300 room nights, in centralized off property sales offices. 
Our sales efforts are more proactive than ever before, with account managers able to sell the broad Marriott managed portfolio from Fairfield Inn to Marriott Hotels & Resorts. 
Under the industries traditional sales approach, sales executives would be assigned a particular property or market and would have little incentive to sell business at other hotels or in other markets. Now with incentives in place to sell across the system, sales executives are booking business in many different hotels, far from the sales executives' typical market area. In 2010, over $100 million of group revenue was booked outside the local market. And in 2011, we estimate this revenue will total nearly $150 million, not only to is the system more productive, our customers prefer our approach and their feedback has been very favorable. We are encouraged by the early results. We are deployed in 37 states, with the remainder to be completed this year. It's important to note that sales transformation doesn't take all sales people off property. For the largest group hotels serving the largest meetings, they continue to have a dedicated sales staff. 
While over the past few years, we have seen some start-up issues to be expected from such change, the system is working. Adjusting for renovations, REVPAR index at deployed full-service hotels increased nearly 1.5% year-over-year in the last three months, and again, this is impressive, given we would have expected REVPAR index to be lower, given where we are in the business cycle. We expect our total group market share will expand further as we bring the substantial power of this system to there. 
Sales transformation for most recent example is Marriott renovation. Years ago, we were the first lodging company to do this revenue management and the first company to offer Marriott brands. But perhaps our first innovation is our business model. It permits rapid unit growth while still yielding impressive returns on invested capital. We very much like today's opportunities in the international markets, and we are aggressively pursuing such growth. In just the last 12 months, we added over 100 hotels outside the United States, launched AC Hotels and Autograph in Europe and announced the expansion of our Fairfield brand in Brazil and India. Asia continues to be a fantastic growth opportunity for us. So far in 2011, we have signed 12 new hotel deals in China and India. But we remain selective about sites, product quality, contract terms, development partners and net present value. All additional room additions are created equal. We are building the system of international hotels in the right markets with the right economics that will provide a solid foundation for successful long-term growth. 
Our current portfolio of luxury and full-service hotels is impressive and produces tremendous cash flow. We've been in the Washington market for over 50 years and today, we have a 33% market share of the Upper Upscale and luxury rooms at our hometown. We've been in New York for over 40 years and today, we have a 21% market share at the Upper Upscale and Luxury rooms there. But our share of upper upscale and luxury rooms in other global gateway markets has reached impressive levels in much less time. As recently as 1991, we had only a single hotel in each of London, Paris and Hong Kong. Today, in a highly fragmented industry, we have a 9% share of the upper upscale and luxury market in Paris, 16% share in London, 20% share in Hong Kong, 20% share in Beijing, 21% share in Shanghai and a 40% share in Moscow, and we continue to grow our share in these valuable markets. 
We have focused our development efforts on gateway markets because they tend to command the highest room rates, provide the strongest economics and add the most value to a brand. We do not set development goals blindly based on room counts. We set our goals to create long-term shareholder value. We invite you to visit our international hotels for yourself to see the quality of our products. 
In the U.S. also, there are still plenty of good opportunity. According to Smith Travel Research, Marriott has roughly 10% of total lodging rooms in the U.S., yet added getting 14,000 rooms to its U.S. system in the last 12 months, 20% more rooms than Hilton and nearly 4x as many rooms openings at Starwood. In fact, one in five hotel rooms opened in the U.S. last year carries one of our brands. 
Only the strongest brands can grow in the U.S. today because only the strongest brands can attract capital and new owners. In fact, launched 12 months ago, our newest Autograph collection brand added nearly 4,000 rooms, far ahead of its competitors. And Autograph is just starting in Europe. 
During our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated how 5% to 9% REVPAR growth from 2010 to 2013 could generate 13% to 22% compounding annual EBITDA growth and $3.3 billion to $5.3 billion of cash flow available to shareholders. Our incentive fees are sensitive to REVPAR improvement, and our strong cash flow and strong brands also drive unit expansion. We have never been more optimistic about our business, our underlying competitive strength and our long-term growth potential. We have been committed to an asset-light strategy for over 30 years. Our decision to spin off our Timeshare business later this year will bring us closer to an ideal business structure with much higher return on investment capital. Combining an attractive ROIC, rapid EBITDA growth and very strong brands, we believe it's a winning combination no matter how you measure it. Now Melissa, we'll take any questions."

Carl, when you look at North American group revenue for the second quarter through the end of the year, versus those revenue expectations contribution from three months ago, would you say they're up, down the same? And then what we're concerned more recently is that group bookings accelerated fairly nicely over the last four or five weeks, if you can comment on that. And then my second question is Carl, how much your share buybacks, additional share buybacks are baked into the guidance and if you could help us understand what the diluted share count, the absolute diluted share count was at the end of the first quarter, that would be helpful."

So as you said, Joe, that is consistent. We have seen strong bookings for the rest of the year for group. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think what we saw in the first quarter was more of an anomaly. As it relates to share repurchase, as you know, our model is such that it generates strong cash flows. And even after our capital expenditures of $500 million to $700 million at this year, we'll have substantial excess capacity, debt capacity and cash flow that we'll use for either opportunistic investment or back into the share repurchase. As you saw, we were pretty aggressive in the first quarter and especially through today, given the current share price. As it relates to the diluted shares, do we have that comp there?"

One is could just talk about the $500 million to $700 million in investment spending that you, at one point, talked about sort of where you are in staging that for this year or whether it accelerates more next year? Then I'm interested on the Timeshare business. The $50 million fee, how did you come up with that number, especially relative to an expectation of $215 million to $220 million of Timeshare sales? And then, the last question, I think you started to address this but I just wanted to get a better sense for it, which was the North American comparable company-operated house profit margin was down 30 basis points, but then going to positive 100 to 150 for the full year. Can you just again expect sort of how that stages or set of how that rolls out over the year? What levers or what ability do you have to put it back up to much more healthier profit margin?"

I think on the capital spending, we talked about this $500 million to $700 million figure for the last couple of quarters. The best bit of guidance for you when you look longer term is to look at the information we shared with you on our last analyst conference. Obviously, with each passing year, fewer and fewer of the dollars that we would model to invest in our business have been committed. And so there's a higher level of guesswork and certainly, the actual investing activity depends on actual deals and our desire to pursue those deals. I think generally, the expectation would be that you would see a roughly flat level of investment spending and '11, '12 and '13. But that will be obviously be driven by optimism as they pop up. On the Timeshare fees, we've put in this release that it will be a $50 million fixed fee, franchise fee with an adjustment for inflation over time plus 2% of sales. And really, what we wanted to do when we structured this was to align the interest of the two companies so as to maximize their joint interest in seeing Marriott-branded Timeshare business grow. We will not be forbidding the stand-alone Timeshare company from doing business that's not branded with our brands. And so we really wanted to be careful about not charging a marginal fee on their sales volume, which would discourage them from growing with us. And so that's really why we ended up with that 2% fee on sales. And I think the $50 million was also just a way of recognizing the tremendous value that the Marriott brand and affiliation and the rewards programs and the other connection with our customer base has provided and will continue to provide for that business going forward. And of course, the branded aspects of the Timeshare business will remain exclusively dedicated to our customers and our people. And then lastly, on margins, yes, it's an interesting comparison between Q1 U.S. margins to minus 30 basis points in full year of plus 100 to 150. You've got a few things that are going on, which are going to impact how those quarters compare. Partly, it's a question of the timing of accrual of incentive comp. You'll recall a year ago at this time in the first quarter, we were really much more tentative about whether or not we would see a recovery, we set up our compensation trends across the company, this would be at both at the hotel level and the corporate level so that more modest bonuses will be paid if you want to achieve the budget which was based on REVPAR numbers, which essentially reflected the weakness, a little bit of the weaker environment that we entered 2010 from. And it was really only an upside performance, significant upside performance that would get managers back to decision where they made kind of incentive comp that they might have in normal times. And so in the first quarter, we were booking much lower levels of accruals for that incentive comp. This year, we're back to more of a normal environment. We think this will come out in as the year goes along because that ultimate potential is not higher but we're booking those incentive comps relatively earlier. Similarly, we got some stuff going on. We've talked about our calendar quarter versus our fiscal quarter. New Year's Day this year is in 2011 for us. It was not in 2010. And that has both an impact on REVPAR, which is quite needed for in the first quarter, not such heavily significant on the full year basis and an impact on margins. And then obviously, when you look at the headline REVPAR number, we would expect those REVPAR numbers to be stronger for the managed portfolio if you use, two, three and four than they were in Q1 and that will have an impact on margins too."

I think as you look at the transition to the point system, you are putting a company in a position where there's not a need to continue to do major development, new development but instead, can be much more efficient in growing the business and continuing to grow the business to the point system by either having existing inventory, which we have about $1.4 billion where the inventory, which about half is finished product on the books so you got a long runway when you come out of the box for growth. And at the same time, as there is a need for new product to add to the system, the projects don't need to be to be as large to support a whole sales infrastructure. Since you're selling points, you're selling all of the resorts at the same time, so the individual projects don't need to be as large. So I think those two things are going to work well in the favor to help with the growth story and at the same time, reduce the need for major capital investments in the system. Right now, the business is generating positive, what I would say positive cash flow, from development in the sense that the product cost right now is greater than the capital you need to put back in the business. And given the level of inventory that we have, I see that continuing in the near term."

Airline ticket has moved meaningfully, I think, particularly the marginal ticket for a leisure traveler. And generally, I think we're seeing that there has not been an impact from either the cost of the airline ticket or gas prices so far. Maybe a more precise way of saying that is that whatever impact exists there has been swamped by the fact that the consumer is feeling more confident and therefore, they're more active than they were a year ago. And so net-net, we still come out with fairly leisure business, and I suspect we'll see that continues to the height of leisure season this year. In other words, that whatever dampening under the surface makes is because of gas prices, we still got a stronger consumer net of that than we would have a year ago."

We do have some issues that we're going to wrestle with that we've long known and have been factored into our guidance. But you look at Shanghai, for example, where we've got 21%, I think, hedged down at our upper upscale and luxury supply. Increasingly in the second quarter and in the third, we'll have tough comparisons in that market because of the World Expo last year. And so those will result in lower headline numbers but still underneath that if business conditions are very good and encouraging."

But as we're looking through the numbers, with now kind of the first and second kind of the dollar numbers that you guys have provided, it actually implies, I think, expense dollars are negative in the second half. And I'm just kind of wondering since you probably have some full year investment as it relates to the building out some of the international stuff, is that realistic and is it really just the difference in kind of timing of accruals? I know you had a big one in the fourth quarter of last year that you'll lap but just wondering if we could get a little bit more clarity on that?"

The other thing that's happening is as Arne pointed out on the margins at the hotels, the G&A also has the effect of our compensation, our incentive compensation, where in the first quarter, we weren't recording the accruals as high last year as we are this year. And then we stabilized in later in the year, so those variances are in there as well."

And I think we talked about 3% to 5% growth in G&A a quarter ago. We would probably tend to today believe that the core G&A rate is probably about the same maybe towards the higher end of that range. And that's driven by the things we referred to in the script, so a bit of that is investing in international growth, which we're really excited about but we are adding people and we've got some initiatives underway to do things like the Fairfield brand in India and Brazil and elsewhere, those things are expensive. And then some other investing in the brands, which we are stepping up a bit. Those would be the primary drivers beyond the normal inflation factors in compensation and the like."

So it varies obviously by hotel and by size of the meetings. So the biggest group hotels are going to tend to have the longest lead time in terms of their group bookings, and they could easily be starting a year like 2011 with 75% of the group business that's been booked in prior years. Hotels which have group business but tend to have smaller, more corporate meetings probably would have a meaningfully smaller percentage of that but I think on average for the Marriott brand, we would say, it's in the 65% range, something like that of group bookings that would be on the books at the beginning of the year for that year. In many respects, it's not at all surprising. You look at something like association business as an example. 2011 is the time when that association business that would have been booked in the heart of the recession, when we were all sitting at our coffee pots and wondering about the financial meltdown and watching Lehman Brothers and all the rest of it, that was the time when the big association meetings, which would be held in 2011 would have been put on the books, some meaningful percentage of them. And so in this sense, we are suffering the consequences in the group space for that recession now in 2011. I think as we look at the way group bookings are coming in, we are quite gratified, and in fact, they show that the recovery is taking place in that space too. To be fair, our bookings in January and February were stronger than they were in March. We're not entirely sure that we can give an explanation for that right now, but you look at the last number of months and even look at the way things are going now, we feel really good about the way group business is coming back. That will obviously ultimately pay benefits in the balance of 2011 but also 2012 and 2013 as well."

But even with that said, we have substantial cash left, and as we've done in the past, we return that to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. And we like share repurchase given our ability to move the lever, so to speak. So I think we'll continue with that same philosophy for the rest of this year and going forward."

This is -- and to some extent, we have had above property that had booking centers and other sales efforts that we've used for a number of years. This is still a significant change in the way we're arrayed against our customers as opposed to arrayed by hotel. And so, it takes a while for these markets to stabilize and to make sure we got true comparisons. We are obviously in active conversation with our owners and franchisees about the way this program is going. You were talking about hundreds and hundreds of hotels that are impacted by it. There hasn't been a program that we've ever done that applies 100% positively for every single hotel. And so, we've been tweaking and calibrating and doing some other things, but generally, what we're seeing is encouraging in the sense that we're taking meaningful market share where we're stabilized. I didn't talk about this, but when you get to a large collection of hotels, in every given year, market share is moving up and down for many hotels in the portfolio. And so, the way we're taking share, we may be seeing 55% of the hotels going up and 45% of them going down. Every hotel's got its own story, and that story is driven by renovation activity, product quality, new supply in the market, what's happening with renovation the competitors and of course, the inherent brand strength and the like. What we're seeing with this sales transformation though is a meaningfully higher number of hotels are taking share with the stabilized markets, and again, our customers are giving us good feedback. We'll continue to be very carefully talking with our owners and working this through. And we don't want to sit here this morning and say that we're done and that victory is totally accomplished, but we're really encouraged by the way this has gone so far and feel like ultimately, this will prove to be what we anticipate, which will be a very powerful driver of market force and enhance customer loyalty and customer market share."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Security laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 21, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. So let's get started. 
In the first quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.26, an 18% increase from prior year and consistent with our $0.24 to $0.28 February guidance. For our fiscal first quarter, system-wide worldwide REVPAR rose 6.5%. In North America, system-wide REVPAR increased 5.8%, just short of our 6% to 8% guidance. If calculated on the basis of the calendar quarter, our North American system-wide REVPAR would have been up 6.8%, a full percentage point higher. 
With strong demand and limited supply growth, most markets in the U.S. reported significant REVPAR growth. In contrast, Washington D.C. was weak, reflecting a significantly shortened congressional calendar, lower government per diem and the lingering threat of a government shutdown. With the recent budget settlement, business is already improving in D.C. New supply in New York also put pressure on REVPAR, although strong demand kept REVPAR growth in positive territory. 
Across the U.S., the Marriott brand in the quarter for the quarter, Group business was weaker than expected. But at the same time, new group bookings made in the first quarter for later in 2011 were strong, up about 10% year-over-year. We believe our first quarter Group business shortfall was an anomaly rather than the start of a trend. 
After reviewing our results, one might ask why was our first quarter REVPAR growth lower than the Smith Travel? Much of the difference is due to the different calendar period as I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have a significant concentration of hotels in Washington where first quarter demand was weak. Systemwide, one in 20 of our domestic hotels are in the greater Washington market, 2.5x the industry's distribution. Our exposure to Group business is also considerably higher than the typical Smith Travel hotel. The average company-operated Marriott brand hotel in the U.S. is merely 45% larger than the average upper upscale Smith Travel hotel, about 40% larger than the typical Sheraton and 25% larger than the typical Hilton. And larger hotels have higher group mix. Since Group business tends to lag in an economic recovery, REVPAR improvement in our group hotels will likely lag as well. 
Another difference from Smith Travel and most of our competitors is that Marriott reports REVPAR results on a comparable store basis, not a same-store basis. We exclude hotels from our REVPAR statistics that are impacted for the full year by meaningful renovations. On a same-store basis, renovations can hurt REVPAR when construction is underway but can yield outside year-over-year gains when construction is complete. We choose to use comparable statistics to remove this volatility and give a more accurate measure of system performance and demand trends. Of course, sometimes renovations are too small to make a hotel non-comp for the full year but still big enough to impact REVPAR results in a given quarter. The renovation of meeting space and a small proportion of the guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott downtown reduced REVPAR growth for the North American company-operated Marriott brand by about 0.5 percentage point alone. This property remained in our comp base because the renovation will be largely complete midyear. 
Renovations of Courtyard lobbies also is still in our comp base, reduced Courtyard company-operated REVPAR by about 1 percentage point as 47 properties are under renovation this year compared to 30 hotels in the year-ago quarter. Now some has speculated that we might be overpriced. We've looked at our pricing trends in the first quarter and feel that we're right on track. We continually evaluate our pricing relative to competitors and market dynamics. Without a doubt, Marriott led the way on price increases in 2010. Today, however, competitors are raising rates as well. Based on our market reviews, we are not overpriced. 
Outside North America, constant dollar REVPAR for comparable system-wide hotels rose 11.2% in the quarter. Demand was very strong in Europe, Latin America and most of Asia, but understandably weak in the Middle East and Japan. House profit margins for our worldwide company-operated properties increased 30 basis points during the quarter, and house profit per available room rose over 6%. 
International Hotels benefited from very strong REVPAR growth, while the 30 basis point decline in North American margins was largely related to the impact of the New Year's holiday in this year's fiscal quarter when it was excluded from the year-ago quarter. U.S. margins were also hurt by higher state unemployment tax rates, higher sales and marketing costs and timing of property-level bonus accruals. 
We expect domestic house profit margins will increase 100 to 150 basis points, and international house profit margins will increase about 100 basis points for the full year. Globally, fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter, including a 5% increase in incentive fees in this seasonally slow quarter. Owned, leased corporate housing and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 67%, reflecting much stronger results from our owned and leased hotels in Germany, the U.K. and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. 
Results also benefited from the impact of converting our hotel from leased to managed. Results from our leased Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Japan declined $2 million alone in the quarter. Branding fees associated with our corporate credit card were strong in the first quarter. 
General and administrative expenses rose 15%, consistent with our guidance, reflecting expenses associated with growth in international markets, higher brand investment, higher accruals for incentive compensation and tough comparisons to favorable items in the prior year's quarter. Last year's G&A included the benefit of $6 million of guarantee reserve reversals and $2 million from collection of a receivable previously reserved. Given that much of the increase in the first quarter G&A were due to non-comparable items in the prior year, we expect the year-over-year increases in G&A to moderate later in the year. 
For our Timeshare business, first quarter contract sales were consistent with expectations. Timeshare segment earnings exceeded expectations due to favorable reportability. Our sales force continued to sign up existing owners to our new points product, and our average contract value continues to build. We launched some special promotions near the end of the quarter to accelerate sales and expect better segment earnings for the full year than previously guided in February.  
Now we are on track with our Timeshare spin-off transaction. We have forwarded our request for a private letter ruling to the IRS, and we are in the process of arranging bank financing for the new company. The Form 10 is underway and we expect to file it with the SEC in June. We currently expect the Timeshare business to pay a franchise fee to Marriott, totaling approximately 2% of developer contract sales plus a flat $50 million annually for the use of our brand. A flat fee would increase periodically by an inflation adjustment. 
At the end of the first quarter, the Timeshare segment had $3.2 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion of inventory and nearly $950 million of securitized debt. So the spin-off will have a significant favorable impact on our balance sheet. More financial information about the new company will be in the Form 10. All in all, we are on track and confident that we will be able to close this transaction later this year. 
Turning to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the first quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a tough comp for our Shanghai hotels later this year. For our 31 hotels in the Middle East and 10 hotels in Japan, we expect REVPAR to remain weak, although we also expect modest improvement over the current levels later this year. 
As a result, for the second quarter and the full year, we expect international REVPAR growth to total 5% to 7%. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, we expect international REVPAR will increase by 8% to 10% in the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full year. 
Today, we have significant Group business on the books for 2011 and special corporate rate negotiations are complete, with rates increasing consistent with our expectation. We see strength in Transient business demand and continue to estimate 6% to 8% REVPAR growth for our North American system-wide hotels for the second quarter and the full year. 
Now let's take a look at the P&L. Compared to our full year guidance in February, today, we expect our fees in Asia will be better than earlier anticipated but will be more than offset by weakness in the Middle East. On the owned, leased and other line, we expect to benefit from stronger performance among our European owned and leased hotels, as well as a higher termination fee, while we also expect a $10 million decline in profits from Japan. 
Our full year outlook for G&A expense is up a bit, reflecting higher legal expenses, some prior year bonus true-ups and a delay in the favorable recognition of a completion guarantee. In the second quarter, we expect G&A will be impacted by higher costs in the international markets, as well as higher workouts and legal costs. 
Interest income for the full year is likely to be a bit lower than we anticipated as we expect we will be repaid early on an outstanding loan. Our share count is coming down quickly as we continue to take advantage of recent share price weakness to repurchase shares. 
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 100 properties with over 14,000 rooms. At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled over 95,000 rooms worldwide, with nearly 39,000 rooms in international markets. Just as many hotel companies take different approaches to measuring REVPAR growth, you'll find different approaches to measuring development pipelines. We take a conservative approach so you can be sure we have even more deals in the works than are reflected in our 95,000 rooms. But because of our approach, our accuracy in predicting unit openings has been quite high. For example, at year-end 2006, our pipeline totaled 100,000 rooms and over the next three years, we actually added just over 100,000 new rooms. 
Looking ahead, with the growing proportion of room additions coming from conversions and last-minute new unit flaggings, we believe our actual openings over the next 3 years are very likely to exceed today's pipeline. Today, nearly 40% of our pipeline rooms are under construction and over 10% are awaiting conversion. We completed the purchase of a 50% interest in the AC Hotel joint venture during the first quarter, which added over 7,000 rooms to our system. We expect to add another 1,700 AC rooms in the second quarter. We plan to launch the AC Hotels by Marriott brand on all our booking channels next month. 
For 2011, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 26% over the prior-year adjusted EPS, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 11% to 16% compared to last year's adjusted amount. 
Now we haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is, unadjusted for pro forma changes or incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We repurchased over 13 million shares for nearly $500 million year-to-date through this week, and we expect to remain aggressive given our recent stock price and substantial excess debt capacity. So with that, I will turn over to Arne."

We made some news at the recent JPMorgan Lodging Conference when we pre-announced our first quarter REVPAR trends. At the time, we didn't have the opportunity to explain in depth what we were seeing. While in a perfect world, we would've preferred to wait until this call so that we have more time to give you a full explanation, we believe that investors deserve to know what we knew in a timely manner. We did not like the idea of participating in such a significant conference and having investors leave there expecting us to meet our REVPAR target when we believed that was unlikely. 
Unfortunately, as is often the case when full information is lacking, there were some who stepped in to speculate. Frankly, I was mystified by some of the conclusions. First, let's begin with market share. Occasionally, you'll hear someone represent recent REVPAR growth rates as a proxy for market share. It goes something like this: If brand A grows REVPAR by 8% and brand B grows REVPAR by 5%, then brand A must be taking 300 basis points of share. This is so superficial as to be meaningless. REVPAR growth statistics alone say little about market share. As Carl discussed earlier, different geographic concentrations, group concentrations and timing of renovations can have a material impact on REVPAR growth without a material impact on market share. 
Similarly, nonsensical is the statement that a brand is taking market share if its average index is higher as a result of deleting its worst-performing hotels. Such a higher average index is mapped, not a result of any movement in market share. 
So let's talk about REVPAR index. REVPAR index is compiled by Smith Travel Research and compares the absolute REVPAR of a particular hotel to the average REVPAR of its specific competitors in the same market. It's not a perfect measure as results can vary based on the selection of the hotels in the competitive set and it doesn't identify performance of specific competitors. But it's the only way we have to evaluate an individual hotel's market share. If the data shows a meaningful change in index, we look for an underlying cause. Sometimes, the property is coming out of a renovation. Sometimes new suppliers enter the market and sometimes, it's simply the economic cycle. 
In an economic decline, stronger brands frequently increase their index as customers are able to find more than typical availability at their favorite hotel. In an economic upturn, on the other hand, weaker brands tend to take share as customers are shut out of their favorite properties as sell out nice increase. Further, hotels with greater group concentration tend to show increasing REVPAR index in weak economic climates when Group business hold up better than Transient. But in strengthening economies, hotels with greater group concentration lag the market as they can't price up as quickly as transient properties. 
While REVPAR index can vary considerably from month to month and business cycle to business cycle, each of our brands has a very strong REVPAR index. Our high index reflects our strong locations, quality products, extensive distribution, popular frequent traveler program, easy-to-use reservation channels and of course, outstanding service both on and off property. While we're not the only company to do well across many of these measures, in our opinion, none of our competitors do as well as Marriott across so many programs, across so many markets and across so many brands. 
The performance of our newest brand, Autograph, is revealing. In 2010, we added a collection of a dozen beautiful, mature and well-run hotels to the new Autograph collection, plugging them in to the Marriott reservation system, frequent traveler program and Back-of-the-House system. While REVPAR index data is only available through February, for the months of December, January and February, the 12 hotels increased REVPAR by 17% and increased REVPAR index by 11 points. By the way, this significant increase is not reflected in this quarter's REVPAR growth rate because these hotels were not in our system in early 2010 and therefore, we do not view them as comp hotels even though obviously, we know how they performed a year ago. 
The bottom line performance of these hotels was even more impressive as they also paid a lot less in booking to those reservations. Our brands and systems have delivered amazing value for these new owners. So how is the Marriott brand REVPAR index doing? After adjusting for the renovation impact at just 2 large hotels, REVPAR index of our company-operated North America Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand hotels was flat in the 3 months ending in February, flat in February year-to-date and flat in February alone. This is gratifying because given our heavy mix of Group business, we would not have been surprised to see our REVPAR index decline at this point in the economic cycle. 
Looking over a longer period of time to capture both sides of the economic cycle, REVPAR index for the Marriott brand rose 1.6 percentage points over the last 2 years and 2.8 percentage points over the last 3 years. After evaluating all of the data, we conclude our brands are doing very well compared to our competitors. Our customer satisfaction scores remain high and our customers remain very loyal. 
Now speaking of our customers. Over half of the occupancy in our hotels is touched by direct sales, largely through group meeting planners, corporate travel managers and other intermediaries. Several years ago, these customers told us that they wanted to deal with sales people who understood and could sell all of our brands, meeting all of their business needs including group business travel and extended stay. We listened and beginning in 2007, started rolling out sales transformation in the U.S., organizing our sales executives to be customer-centric rather than property-centric. By reducing the number of property sales calls made to the same customer, we are calling on many times more customers. That is more sales calls, to corporations, to associations, to religious organizations, even to sports teams. And while our sales staff at very large properties remain on property, we are booking most medium-sized group meetings defined as 100 to 300 room nights, in centralized off property sales offices. 
Our sales efforts are more proactive than ever before, with account managers able to sell the broad Marriott managed portfolio from Fairfield Inn to Marriott Hotels & Resorts. Under the industry of traditional sales approach, sales executives would be assigned a particular property or market and would have little incentive to sell business at other hotels or in other markets. Now with incentives in place to sell across the system, sales executives are booking business in many different hotels, far from the sales executives' typical market area. 
In 2010, over $100 million of group revenue was booked outside the local market. And in 2011, we estimate this revenue will total nearly $150 million. Not only is the system more productive, our customers prefer our approach and their feedback has been very favorable. We are encouraged by the early results. We are deployed in 37 states, with the remainder to be completed this year. It's important to note that sales transformation doesn't take all sales people off property. For the largest group hotels serving the largest meetings, they continue to have a dedicated sales staff.
While over the past few years, we have seen some start-up issues to be expected from such change, this system is working. Adjusting for renovations, REVPAR index at deployed full-service hotels increased nearly 1.5% year-over-year in the last 3 months. And again, this is impressive given we would have expected REVPAR index to be lower, given where we are in the business cycle. We expect our total group market share will expand further as we bring the substantial power of this system to bear. 
Sales transformation is the most recent example of Marriott innovation. Years ago, we were the first lodging company to introduce revenue management and the first hotel company to offer Marriott brands. But perhaps our first innovation is our business model. It permits rapid unit growth while still yielding impressive returns on invested capital. 
We very much like today's opportunities in the international markets, and we are aggressively pursuing such growth. In just the last 12 months, we added over 100 hotels outside the United States, launched AC Hotels and Autograph in Europe and announced the expansion of our Fairfield brand in Brazil and India. Asia continues to be a fantastic growth opportunity for us. So far in 2011, we have signed 12 new hotel deals in China and India. But we remain selective about sites, product quality, contract terms, development partners and net present value. All additional room additions are not created equal. We are building the system of international hotels in the right markets with the right economics that will provide a solid foundation for successful long-term growth. 
Our current portfolio of luxury and full-service hotels is impressive and produces tremendous cash flow. We've been in the Washington market for over 50 years and today, we have a 33% market share of upper-upscale and luxury rooms at our hometown. We've been in New York for over 40 years and today, we have a 21% market share of the upper-upscale and luxury rooms there. But our share of upper-upscale and luxury rooms in other global gateway markets has reached impressive levels in much less time. As recently as 1991, we had only a single hotel in each of London, Paris and Hong Kong. Today, in a highly fragmented industry, we have a 9% share of the upper-upscale and luxury market in Paris, 16% share in London, 20% share in Hong Kong, 20% share in Beijing, 21% share in Shanghai and a 40% share in Moscow. And we continue to grow our share in these valuable markets. 
We have focused our development efforts on gateway markets because they tend to command the highest room rates, provide the strongest economics and add the most value to a brand. We do not set development goals blindly based on room counts. We set our goals to create long-term shareholder value. We invite you to visit our international hotels for yourself to see the quality of our products. 
In the U.S. also, there is still plenty of growth opportunity. According to Smith Travel Research, Marriott has roughly 10% of total lodging rooms in the U.S. yet added nearly 14,000 rooms to its U.S. system in the last 12 months; 20% more rooms than Hilton and nearly 4x as many room openings at Starwood. In fact, 1 in 5 hotel rooms opened in the U.S. last year carries one of our brands. 
Only the strongest brands can grow in the U.S. today because only the strongest brands can attract capital and new owners. In fact, since its launch 12 months ago, our newest Autograph collection brand added nearly 4,000 rooms, far ahead of its competitors. And Autograph is just starting in Europe. 
During our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated how 5% to 9% REVPAR growth from 2010 to 2013 could generate 13% to 22% compounding annual EBITDA growth and $3.3 billion to $5.3 billion of cash flow available to shareholders. Our incentive fees are sensitive to REVPAR improvement, and our strong cash flow and strong brands also drive unit expansion. We have never been more optimistic about our business, our underlying competitive strength and our long-term growth potential. We have been committed to an asset-light strategy for over 30 years. Our decision to spin off our Timeshare business later this year will bring us closer to an ideal business structure with much higher return on invested capital. Combining an attractive ROIC, rapid EBITDA growth and very strong brands, we believe it's a winning combination no matter how you measure it. 
Now Melissa, we'll take any questions."

As it relates to share repurchase, as you know, our model is such that it generates strong cash flows. And even after our capital expenditures of $500 million to $700 million this year, we'll have substantial excess capacity, debt capacity and cash flow that we'll use for either opportunistic investment or back into the share repurchase.

I think you started to address this but I just wanted to get a better sense for it, which was the North American comparable company-operated house profit margin was down 30 basis points but then going to positive 100 to 150 for the full year.

I think on the capital spending, we talked about this $500 million to $700 million figure for the last couple of quarters. It's still probably the best bit of guidance for you when you look longer term is to look at the information we shared with you at our last analyst conference. Obviously, with each passing year, fewer and fewer of the dollars that we would model to invest in our business have been committed. And so there's a higher level of guesswork. And certainly, the actual investing activity depends on actual deals and our desire to pursue those deals. I think generally, the expectation would be that you would see a roughly flat level of investment spending in '11, '12 and '13. But that will be obviously be driven by optimism as they pop up. On the Timeshare fees, we've put in this release that it'll be a $50 million fixed fee, franchise fee with an adjustment for inflation over time plus 2% of sales. And really, what we wanted to do when we structured this was to align the interest of the 2 companies so as to maximize their joint interest in seeing Marriott-branded Timeshare business grow. We will not be forbidding the stand-alone Timeshare company from doing business that's not branded with our brands. And so we really wanted to be careful about not charging a marginal fee on their sales volume, which would discourage them from growing with us. And so that's really why we ended up with that 2% fee on sales. And I think the $50 million was also just a way of recognizing the tremendous value that the Marriott brand and affiliation and the rewards programs and the other connection with our customer base has provided and will continue to provide for that business going forward. And of course, the branded aspects of the Timeshare business will remain exclusively dedicated to our customers and our people. And then lastly, on margins. Yes, it's an interesting comparison between Q1 U.S. margins to minus 30 basis points in the full year of plus 100 to 150. You've got a few things that are going on, which are going to impact how those quarters compare. Partly, it's a question of the timing of the accrual of incentive comp. You'll recall a year ago at this time in the first quarter, we were really much more tentative about whether or not we would see a recovery. We set up our compensation plans across the company. This would be at both the hotel level and the corporate level so that more modest bonuses would be paid if we only achieve the budget, which was based on REVPAR numbers which essentially reflected the weakness, a little bit of the weaker environment that we entered 2010 from. And it was really only an upside performance, significant upside performance that would get managers back to decision where they made kind of incentive comp that they might have in normal times. And so in the first quarter, we were booking much lower levels of accruals for that incentive comp. This year, we're back to more of a normal environment. We think this will come out as the year goes along because that ultimate potential is not higher, but we're booking those incentive comps relatively earlier. Similarly, we got some squirrelly stuff going on. We talked about our calendar quarter versus our fiscal quarter. New Year's Day this year is in 2011 for us, it was not in 2010. And that has both an impact on REVPAR, which is quite needed for in the first quarter, not so terribly significant on a full year basis and an impact on margins. And then obviously, when you look at the headline REVPAR number, we would expect those REVPAR numbers to be stronger for the managed portfolio in Qs 2, 3 and 4 than they were in Q1 then they will have an impact on margins, too."

I think as you look at the transition to the point system, you are putting a company in a position where there's not a need to continue to do major development, new development. But instead, it can be much more efficient in growing the business and continuing to grow the business to the point system by either having the existing inventory, which we have about $1.4 billion worth of inventory, which about half is finished product on the books so you got a long runway when you come out of the box for growth. And at the same time, as there is a need for new product to add to the system, the projects don't need to be to be as large to support our whole sales infrastructure. Since you're selling points, you're selling all of the resorts at the same time, so the individual projects don't need to be as large. So I think those 2 things are going to work well in the favor to help with the growth story and at the same time, reduce the need for major capital investments in the system. Right now, the business is generating positive, what I would say positive cash flow from development in the sense that the product cost right now is greater than the capital you need to put back in the business.

Also, whether or not they will be in an acquisition mode or a merger mode with other brands, again, I think as it first spins off, it will tend to deal with what it has right now. Like I said, we have plenty of inventory, about $1.4 billion on the books. But it will not be precluded from doing any type of mergers or acquisitions going down the road."

We obviously have seen gas prices move, approaching $4 a gallon in most markets, some over. And I think are watching both gasoline or what that does to the drive market, but also a little bit what that does to cost of the airline ticket. Airline ticket has moved meaningfully, I think, particularly the marginal ticket for a leisure traveler. And generally, I think we're seeing that there has not been an impact from either the cost of the airline ticket or gas prices so far. Maybe a more precise way of saying that is that whatever impact exists there has been swamped by the fact that the consumer is feeling more confident and therefore, they're more active than they were a year ago. And so net-net, we still come out with growing Leisure business and I suspect we'll see that, that continues through the height of leisure season this year. In other words, that whatever dampening under the surface makes just because of gas prices, we've still got a stronger consumer net of that than we would have had a year ago."

And Middle East, of course, the most targeted markets will be Egypt and Bahrain. Japan obviously has been devastated by what hits them for about a month ago or 6 weeks ago and we anticipated none of that. There was a little bit of impact in Q1 from those things but really not very significant. To some extent, we would see a relatively greater strength in Europe and Asia as mostly offsetting those, which is why we're more or less at the same place on sort of earnings for the full year and mostly in the same place as far as it relates to REVPAR guidance. We do have some issues that we're going to wrestle with that we've long known and have been factored into our guidance. But you look at Shanghai, for example, where we've got 21%, I think hedged at our upper-upscale and luxury supply. Increasingly in the second quarter and in the third, we'll have tough comparisons in that market because of the World Expo last year. And so those will result in lower headline numbers.

And that's driven by the things we referred to in the script. So a bit of that is investing in international growth, which we're really excited about. That we are adding people and we've got some initiatives underway to do things like the Fairfield brand in India and Brazil and elsewhere and those things are expensive.

So the biggest group hotels are going to tend to have the longest lead time in terms of their group bookings. And they could easily be starting a year like 2011 with 75% of the Group business that's been booked in prior years. Hotels which have Group business but tend to have smaller, more corporate meetings probably would have a meaningfully smaller percentage of that. But I think on an average for the Marriott brand, we would say, it's in the 65% range, something like that of group bookings that would be on the books at the beginning of the year for that year. In many respects, it's not at all surprising. You look at something like Association business as an example. 2011 is the time when that Association business that would have been booked in the heart of the recession, when we were all sitting at our coffee pots and wondering about the financial meltdown and watching Lehman Brothers and all the rest of it, that was the time when the big association meetings, which would be held in 2011 would have been put on the books. Some meaningful percentage of them. And so in a sense, we are suffering the consequences in the group space for that recession now in 2011. I think as we look at the way group bookings are coming in, we are quite gratified. And in fact, they show that the recovery is taking place in that space, too. To be fair, our bookings in January and February were stronger than they were in March. We're not entirely sure that we can give you an explanation for that right now. But you look at the last number of months and you even look at the way things are going now, we feel really good about the way Group business is coming back.

Can you repeat for us like where you are in the rollout? When do you think the remainder of the rollout happens this year? I'm just curious from a timing standpoint. And I guess how do you respond to the concerns that some segments of the business had been disproportionately impacted or benefited? Is that a fair statement?"

We are, I think I said in the prepared remarks, 37 states have been rolled out. The balance of the U.S. will be rolled out by midyear 2011. And while for the biggest hotels, there are still sales people are on property, this is -- and to some extent, we have had above property, that booking centers and other sales efforts that we've used for a number of years. This is still a significant change in the way we're arrayed against our customers as opposed to arrayed by hotel. And so it takes a while for these markets to stabilize and to make sure that we've got true comparisons. We are obviously in active conversation with our owners and franchisees about the way this program is going. You were talking about hundreds and hundreds of hotels that are impacted by it. There hasn't been a program that we've ever done that applies 100% positively for every single hotel. And so we've been tweaking and calibrating and doing some other things. But generally, what we're seeing is encouraging in the sense that we're taking meaningful market share where we're stabilized. I didn't talk about this, but when you get to a large collection of hotels, in every given year, market share is moving up and down for many hotels in the portfolio. And so when we're taking share, we may be seeing 55% of the hotels going up and 45% of them going down. Every hotel has got its own story, and that story is driven by renovation activity, product quality, new supply in the market, what's happening with renovations with competitors and of course, the inherent brand strength and the like. What we're seeing with this sales transformation though is a meaningfully higher number of hotels are taking share with the stabilized markets. And again, our customers are giving us good feedback. We'll continue to be very carefully talking with our owners and working this through. And we don't want to sit here this morning and say that we're done and that victory is totally accomplished. But we're really encouraged by the way this has gone so far and feel like ultimately, this will prove to be what we anticipate, which will be a very powerful driver of market force and enhance customer loyalty and customer market share."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Seni",2088,"Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal security laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 21, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. So let's get started. 
In the first quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.26, an 18% increase from prior year and consistent with our $0.24 to $0.28 February guidance. For our fiscal first quarter, system-wide worldwide REVPAR rose 6.5%. In North America, system-wide REVPAR increased 5.8%, just short of our 6% to 8% guidance. If calculated on the basis of the calendar quarter, our North American system-wide REVPAR would have been up 6.8%, a full percentage point higher. 
With strong demand and limited supply growth, most markets in the U.S. reported significant REVPAR growth. In contrast, Washington D.C. was weak, reflecting a significantly shortened congressional calendar, lower government per diems and the lingering threat of a government shutdown. With the recent budget settlement, business is already improving in D.C. New supply in New York also put pressure on REVPAR, although strong demand kept REVPAR growth in positive territory. 
Across the U.S., the Marriott brand in the quarter for the quarter, group business was weaker than expected. But at the same time, new group bookings made in the first quarter for later in 2011 were strong, up about 10% year-over-year. We believe our first quarter group business shortfall was an anomaly rather than the start of a trend. 
After reviewing our results, one might ask why was our first quarter REVPAR growth lower than the Smith Travel? Much of the difference is due to the different calendar period as I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have a significant concentration of hotels in Washington where first quarter demand was weak. System wide, 1 in 20 of our domestic hotels are in the greater Washington market, 2.5x the industry's distribution. Our exposure to group business is also considerably higher than the typical Smith Travel hotel. The average company-operated Marriott brand hotel in the U.S. is merely 45% larger than the average upper upscale Smith Travel hotel, about 40% larger than the typical Sheraton and 25% larger than the typical Hilton. And larger hotels have higher group mix. Since group business tends to lag in an economic recovery, REVPAR improvement in our group hotels will likely lag as well. 
Another difference from Smith Travel and most of our competitors is that Marriott reports REVPAR results on a comparable store basis, not a same-store basis. We exclude hotels from our REVPAR statistics that are impacted for the full year by meaningful renovations. On a same-store basis, renovations can hurt REVPAR when construction is underway but can yield outside year-over-year gains when construction is complete. We choose to use comparable statistics to remove this volatility and give a more accurate measure of system performance and demand trends. Of course, sometimes renovations are too small to make a hotel non-comp for the full year but still big enough to impact REVPAR results in a given quarter. The renovation of meeting space and a small proportion of the guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott downtown reduced REVPAR growth for the North American company-operated Marriott brand by about 0.5 percentage point alone. This property remained in our comp base because the renovation will be largely complete midyear. 
Renovations of Courtyard lobbies also is still in our comp base, reduced Courtyard company-operated REVPAR by about 1 percentage point as 47 properties are under renovation this year compared to 30 hotels in the year-ago quarter. Now some has speculated that we might be overpriced. We've looked at our pricing trends in the first quarter and feel that we're right on track. We continually evaluate our pricing relative to competitors and market dynamics. Without a doubt, Marriott led the way on price increases in 2010. Today, however, competitors are raising rates as well. Based on our market reviews, we are not overpriced. 
Outside North America, constant dollar REVPAR for comparable system-wide hotels rose 11.2% in the quarter. Demand was very strong in Europe, Latin America and most of Asia, but understandably weak in the Middle East and Japan. House profit margins for our worldwide company-operated properties increased 30 basis points during the quarter, and house profit per available room rose over 6%. 
International Hotels benefited from very strong REVPAR growth, while the 30 basis point decline in North American margins was largely related to the impact of the New Year's holiday in this year's fiscal quarter when it was excluded from the year-ago quarter. U.S. margins were also hurt by higher state unemployment tax rates, higher sales and marketing costs and timing of property-level bonus accruals. 
We expect domestic house profit margins will increase 100 to 150 basis points, and international house profit margins will increase about 100 basis points for the full year. Globally, fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter, including a 5% increase in incentive fees in this seasonally slow quarter. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 67%, reflecting much stronger results from our owned and leased hotels in Germany, the U.K. and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. 
Results also benefited from the impact of converting a hotel from leased to managed. Results from our leased Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Japan declined $2 million alone in the quarter. Branding fees associated with our corporate credit card were strong in the first quarter. 
General and administrative expenses rose 15%, consistent with our guidance, reflecting expenses associated with growth in international markets, higher brand investment, higher accruals for incentive compensation and tough comparisons to favorable items in the prior year's quarter. Last year's G&A included the benefit of $6 million of guarantee reserve reversals and $2 million from collection of a receivable previously reserved. Given that much of the increase in the first quarter G&A were due to non-comparable items in the prior year, we expect the year-over-year increases in G&A to moderate later in the year. 
For our Timeshare business, first quarter contract sales were consistent with expectations. Timeshare segment earnings exceeded expectations due to favorable reportability. Our sales force continued to sign up existing owners to our new points product, and our average contract value continues to build. We launched some special promotions near the end of the quarter to accelerate sales and expect better segment earnings for the full year than previously guided in February.  
Now we are on track with our Timeshare spin-off transaction. We have forwarded our request for a private letter ruling to the IRS, and we are in the process of arranging bank financing for the new company. The Form 10 is underway and we expect to file it with the SEC in June. We currently expect the Timeshare business to pay a franchise fee to Marriott, totaling approximately 2% of developer contract sales plus a flat $50 million annually for the use of our brand. A flat fee would increase periodically by an inflation adjustment. 
At the end of the first quarter, the Timeshare segment had $3.2 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion of inventory and nearly $950 million of securitized debt. So the spin-off will have a significant favorable impact on our balance sheet. More financial information about the new company will be in the Form 10. All in all, we are on track and confident that we will be able to close this transaction later this year. 
Turning to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the first quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a tough comp for our Shanghai hotels later this year. For our 31 hotels in the Middle East and 10 hotels in Japan, we expect REVPAR to remain weak, although we also expect modest improvement over the current levels later this year. 
As a result, for the second quarter and the full year, we expect international REVPAR growth to total 5% to 7%. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, we expect international REVPAR will increase by 8% to 10% in the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full year. 
Today, we have significant group business on the books for 2011 and special corporate rate negotiations are complete, with rates increasing consistent with our expectation. We see strength in transient business demand and continue to estimate 6% to 8% REVPAR growth for our North American system-wide hotels for the second quarter and the full year. 
Now let's take a look at the P&L. Compared to our full year guidance in February, today, we expect our fees in Asia will be better than earlier anticipated but will be more than offset by weakness in the Middle East. On the owned, leased and other line, we expect to benefit from stronger performance among our European owned and leased hotels, as well as a higher termination fee, while we also expect a $10 million decline in profits from Japan. 
Our full year outlook for G&A expense is up a bit, reflecting higher legal expenses, some prior year bonus true-ups and a delay in the favorable recognition of a completion guarantee. In the second quarter, we expect G&A will be impacted by higher costs in the international markets, as well as higher workouts and legal costs. 
Interest income for the full year is likely to be a bit lower than we anticipated as we expect we will be repaid early on an outstanding loan. Our share count is coming down quickly as we continue to take advantage of recent share price weakness to repurchase shares. 
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 100 properties with over 14,000 rooms. At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled over 95,000 rooms worldwide, with nearly 39,000 rooms in international markets. Just as many hotel companies take different approaches to measuring REVPAR growth, you'll find different approaches to measuring development pipelines. We take a conservative approach so you can be sure we have even more deals in the works than are reflected in our 95,000 rooms. But because of our approach, our accuracy in predicting unit openings has been quite high. For example, at year-end 2006, our pipeline totaled 100,000 rooms and over the next three years, we actually added just over 100,000 new rooms. 
Looking ahead, with the growing proportion of room additions coming from conversions and last-minute new unit flaggings, we believe our actual openings over the next 3 years are very likely to exceed today's pipeline. Today, nearly 40% of our pipeline rooms are under construction and over 10% are awaiting conversion. We completed the purchase of a 50% interest in the AC Hotel joint venture during the first quarter, which added over 7,000 rooms to our system. We expect to add another 1,700 AC rooms in the second quarter. We plan to launch the AC Hotels by Marriott brand on all our booking channels next month. 
For 2011, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 26% over the prior-year adjusted EPS, assuming 6% to 8% worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth and roughly 35,000 gross room additions. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 11% to 16% compared to last year's adjusted amount. 
Now we haven't adjusted our earnings guidance for the pending Timeshare transaction and are providing an earnings outlook, assuming the businesses remain as is, unadjusted for pro forma changes or incremental expenses associated with the split of the company. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We repurchased over 13 million shares for nearly $500 million year-to-date through this week, and we expect to remain aggressive given our recent stock price and substantial excess debt capacity. So with that, I will turn over to Arne."

We made some news at the recent JPMorgan Lodging Conference when we pre-announced our first quarter REVPAR trends. At the time, we didn't have the opportunity to explain in depth what we were seeing. While in a perfect world, we would've preferred to wait until this call so that we have more time to give you a full explanation, we believe that investors deserve to know what we knew in a timely manner. We did not like the idea of participating in such a significant conference and having investors leave there expecting us to meet our REVPAR target when we believed that was unlikely. 
Unfortunately, as is often the case when full information is lacking, there were some who stepped in to speculate. Frankly, I was mystified by some of the conclusions. First, let's begin with market share. Occasionally, you'll hear someone represent recent REVPAR growth rates as a proxy for market share. It goes something like this: If brand A grows REVPAR by 8% and brand B grows REVPAR by 5%, then brand A must be taking 300 basis points of share. This is so superficial as to be meaningless. REVPAR growth statistics alone say little about market share. As Carl discussed earlier, different geographic concentrations, group concentrations and timing of renovations can have a material impact on REVPAR growth without a material impact on market share. 
Similarly, nonsensical is the statement that a brand is taking market share if its average index is higher as a result of deleting its worst-performing hotels. Such a higher average index is mapped, not a result of any movement in market share. 
So let's talk about REVPAR index. REVPAR index is compiled by Smith Travel Research and compares the absolute REVPAR of a particular hotel to the average REVPAR of its specific competitors in the same market. It's not a perfect measure as results can vary based on the selection of the hotels in the competitive set and it doesn't identify performance of specific competitors. But it's the only way we have to evaluate an individual hotel's market share. If the data shows a meaningful change in index, we look for an underlying cause. Sometimes, the property is coming out of a renovation. Sometimes new supply has entered the market and sometimes, it's simply the economic cycle. 
In an economic decline, stronger brands frequently increase their index as customers are able to find more than typical availability at their favorite hotel. In an economic upturn, on the other hand, weaker brands tend to take share as customers are shut out of their favorite properties as sell out nights increase. Further, hotels with greater group concentration tend to show increasing REVPAR index in weak economic climates when group business hold up better than transient. But in strengthening economies, hotels with greater group concentration lag the market as they can't price up as quickly as transient properties. 
While REVPAR index can vary considerably from month to month and business cycle to business cycle, each of our brands has a very strong REVPAR index. Our high index reflects our strong locations, quality products, extensive distribution, popular frequent traveler program, easy-to-use reservation channels and of course, outstanding service both on and off property. While we're not the only company to do well across many of these measures, in our opinion, none of our competitors do as well as Marriott across so many programs, across so many markets and across so many brands. 
The performance of our newest brand, Autograph, is revealing. In 2010, we added a collection of a dozen beautiful, mature and well-run hotels to the new Autograph collection, plugging them in to the Marriott reservation system, frequent traveler program and Back-of-the-House system. While REVPAR index data is only available through February, for the months of December, January and February, the 12 hotels increased REVPAR by 17% and increased REVPAR index by 11 points. By the way, this significant increase is not reflected in this quarter's REVPAR growth rate because these hotels were not in our system in early 2010 and therefore, we do not view them as comp hotels even though obviously, we know how they performed a year ago. 
The bottom line performance of these hotels was even more impressive as they also paid a lot less to book each of those reservations. Our brands and systems have delivered amazing value for these new owners. So how is the Marriott brand REVPAR index doing? After adjusting for the renovation impact at just 2 large hotels, REVPAR index of our company-operated North America Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand hotels was flat in the 3 months ending in February, flat in February year-to-date and flat in February alone. This is gratifying because given our heavy mix of group business, we would not have been surprised to see our REVPAR index decline at this point in the economic cycle. 
Looking over a longer period of time to capture both sides of the economic cycle, REVPAR index for the Marriott brand rose 1.6 percentage points over the last 2 years and 2.8 percentage points over the last 3 years. After evaluating all of the data, we conclude our brands are doing very well compared to our competitors. Our customer satisfaction scores remain high and our customers remain very loyal. 
Now speaking of our customers. Over half of the occupancy in our hotels is touched by direct sales, largely through group meeting planners, corporate travel managers and other intermediaries. Several years ago, these customers told us that they wanted to deal with sales people who understood and could sell all of our brands, meeting all of their business needs including group, business travel, and extended stay. We listened and beginning in 2007, started rolling out sales transformation in the U.S., organizing our sales executives to be customer-centric rather than property-centric. By reducing the number of property sales calls made to the same customer, we are calling on many times more customers. That is more sales calls, to corporations, to associations, to religious organizations, even to sports teams. And while our sales staff at very large properties remain on property, we are booking most medium-sized group meetings defined as 100 to 300 room nights, in centralized off property sales offices. 
Our sales efforts are more proactive than ever before, with account managers able to sell the broad Marriott managed portfolio from Fairfield Inn to Marriott Hotels & Resorts. Under the industry’s traditional sales approach, sales executives would be assigned a particular property or market and would have little incentive to sell business at other hotels or in other markets. Now with incentives in place to sell across the system, sales executives are booking business in many different hotels, far from the sales executives' typical market area. 
In 2010, over $100 million of group revenue was booked outside the local market. And in 2011, we estimate this revenue will total nearly $150 million. Not only is the system more productive, our customers prefer our approach and their feedback has been very favorable. We are encouraged by the early results. We are deployed in 37 states, with the remainder to be completed this year. It's important to note that sales transformation doesn't take all sales people off property. For the largest group hotels serving the largest meetings, they continue to have a dedicated sales staff.
While over the past few years, we have seen some start-up issues to be expected from such a change, this system is working. Adjusting for renovations, REVPAR index at deployed full-service hotels increased nearly 1.5% year-over-year in the last 3 months. And again, this is impressive given we would have expected REVPAR index to be lower, given where we are in the business cycle. We expect our total group market share will expand further as we bring the substantial power of this system to bear. 
Sales transformation is the most recent example of Marriott innovation. Years ago, we were the first lodging company to introduce revenue management and the first hotel company to offer Marriott brands. But perhaps our first innovation is our business model. It permits rapid unit growth while still yielding impressive returns on invested capital. 
We very much like today's opportunities in the international markets, and we are aggressively pursuing such growth. In just the last 12 months, we added over 100 hotels outside the United States, launched AC Hotels and Autograph in Europe and announced the expansion of our Fairfield brand in Brazil and India. Asia continues to be a fantastic growth opportunity for us. So far in 2011, we have signed 12 new hotel deals in China and India. But we remain selective about sites, product quality, contract terms, development partners and net present value. All additional room additions are not created equal. We are building the system of international hotels in the right markets with the right economics that will provide a solid foundation for successful long-term growth. 
Our current portfolio of luxury and full-service hotels is impressive and produces tremendous cash flow. We've been in the Washington market for over 50 years and today, we have a 33% market share of upper-upscale and luxury rooms at our hometown. We've been in New York for over 40 years and today, we have a 21% market share of the upper-upscale and luxury rooms there. But our share of upper-upscale and luxury rooms in other global gateway markets has reached impressive levels in much less time. As recently as 1991, we had only a single hotel in each of London, Paris and Hong Kong. Today, in a highly fragmented industry, we have a 9% share of the upper-upscale and luxury market in Paris, 16% share in London, 20% share in Hong Kong, 20% share in Beijing, 21% share in Shanghai and a 40% share in Moscow. And we continue to grow our share in these valuable markets. 
We have focused our development efforts on gateway markets because they tend to command the highest room rates, provide the strongest economics and add the most value to a brand. We do not set development goals blindly based on room counts. We set our goals to create long-term shareholder value. We invite you to visit our international hotels for yourself to see the quality of our products. 
In the U.S. also, there is still plenty of growth opportunity. According to Smith Travel Research, Marriott has roughly 10% of total lodging rooms in the U.S. yet added nearly 14,000 rooms to its U.S. system in the last 12 months, 20% more rooms than Hilton and nearly 4x as many room openings at Starwood. In fact, 1 in 5 hotel rooms opened in the U.S. last year carries one of our brands. 
Only the strongest brands can grow in the U.S. today because only the strongest brands can attract capital and new owners. In fact, since its launch 12 months ago, our newest Autograph collection brand added nearly 4,000 rooms, far ahead of its competitors. And Autograph is just starting in Europe. 
During our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated how 5% to 9% REVPAR growth from 2010 to 2013 could generate 13% to 22% compounding annual EBITDA growth and $3.3 billion to $5.3 billion of cash flow available to shareholders. Our incentive fees are sensitive to REVPAR improvement, and our strong cash flow and strong brands also drive unit expansion. We have never been more optimistic about our business, our underlying competitive strength and our long-term growth potential. We have been committed to an asset-light strategy for over 30 years. Our decision to spin off our Timeshare business later this year will bring us closer to an ideal business structure with much higher return on invested capital. Combining an attractive ROIC, rapid EBITDA growth and very strong brands, we believe it's a winning combination no matter how you measure it. 
Now Melissa, we'll take any questions."

And if you could help us understand what the diluted share count was -- the absolute diluted share count was at the end of the first quarter, that would be helpful."

In fact, in the first quarter, our group bookings for the rest of 2011 were up 10%. And March was 1 of, I think, the second best months for group bookings that we've seen in the last couple of years. So as you said, Joe, that is consistent. We have seen strong bookings for the rest of the year for the group. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think what we saw in the first quarter was more of an anomaly. As it relates to share repurchase, as you know, our model is such that it generates strong cash flows. And even after our capital expenditures of $500 million to $700 million this year, we'll have substantial excess capacity, debt capacity and cash flow that we'll use for either opportunistic investment or back into the share repurchase. As you saw, we were pretty aggressive in the first quarter and especially through today, given the current share price. As it relates to the diluted shares, do we have that count there?"

One is, could just talk about the $500 million to $700 million in investment spending that you, at one point, talked about? Sort of where you are on staging that for this year and whether it accelerates more next year? Then I'm interested on the Timeshare business. The $50 million fee, how did you come up with that number, especially relative to an expectation of $215 million to $220 million of Timeshare sales? And then the last question. I think you started to address this but I just wanted to get a better sense for it, which was the North American comparable company-operated house profit margin was down 30 basis points but then going to positive 100 to 150 basis points for the full year. Can you just again explain sort of how that stages or sort of how that rolls out over the year? What levers or what ability do you have to move it back up to a much more healthier profit margin?"

I think on the capital spending, we talked about this $500 million to $700 million figure for the last couple of quarters. It's still probably the best bit of guidance for you when you look longer term is to look at the information we shared with you at our last analyst conference. Obviously, with each passing year, fewer and fewer of the dollars that we would model to invest in our business have been committed. And so there's a higher level of guesswork. And certainly, the actual investing activity depends on actual deals and our desire to pursue those deals. I think generally, the expectation would be that you would see a roughly flat level of investment spending in '11, '12 and '13. But that will be obviously be driven by optimism as they pop up. On the Timeshare fees, we've put in this release that it'll be a $50 million fixed fee, franchise fee with an adjustment for inflation over time plus 2% of sales. And really, what we wanted to do when we structured this was to align the interest of the 2 companies so as to maximize their joint interest in seeing Marriott-branded Timeshare business grow. We will not be forbidding the stand-alone Timeshare company from doing business that's not branded with our brands. And so we really wanted to be careful about not charging a marginal fee on their sales volume, which would discourage them from growing with us. And so that's really why we ended up with that 2% fee on sales. And I think the $50 million was also just a way of recognizing the tremendous value that the Marriott brand and affiliation and the rewards programs and the other connection with our customer base has provided and will continue to provide for that business going forward. And of course, the branded aspects of the Timeshare business will remain exclusively dedicated to our customers and our people. And then lastly, on margins. Yes, it's an interesting comparison between Q1 U.S. margins to minus 30 basis points in the full year of plus 100 to 150 basis points. You've got a few things that are going on, which are going to impact how those quarters compare. Partly, it's a question of the timing of the accrual of incentive comp. You'll recall a year ago at this time in the first quarter, we were really much more tentative about whether or not we would see a recovery. We set up our compensation plans across the company. This would be at both the hotel level and the corporate level so that more modest bonuses would be paid if we only achieve the budget, which was based on REVPAR numbers which essentially reflected the weakness, a little bit of the weaker environment that we entered 2010 from. And it was really only an upside performance, significant upside performance that would get managers back to position where they made kind of incentive comp that they might have in normal times. And so in the first quarter, we were booking much lower levels of accruals for that incentive comp. This year, we're back to more of a normal environment. We think this will come out in the wash as the year goes along because that ultimate potential is not higher, but we're booking those incentive comps relatively earlier. Similarly, we got some squirrelly stuff going on. We talked about our calendar quarter versus our fiscal quarter. New Year's Day this year is in 2011 for us, it was not in 2010. And that has both an impact on REVPAR, which is quite needed for in the first quarter, not so terribly significant on a full year basis and an impact on margins. And then obviously, when you look at the headline REVPAR number, we would expect those REVPAR numbers to be stronger for the managed portfolio in Qs 2, 3 and 4 than they were in Q1 then they will have an impact on margins, too."

I think as you look at the transition to the point system, you are putting a company in a position where there's not a need to continue to do major development, new development. But instead, it can be much more efficient in growing the business and continuing to grow the business to the point system by either having the existing inventory, which we have about $1.4 billion worth of inventory, which about 1/2 is finished product on the books so you got a long runway when you come out of the box for growth. And at the same time, as there is a need for new product to add to the system, the projects don't need to be to be as large to support a whole sales infrastructure. Since you're selling points, you're selling all of the resorts at the same time, so the individual projects don't need to be as large. So I think those 2 things are going to work well in the favor to help with the growth story and at the same time, reduce the need for major capital investments in the system. Right now, the business is generating positive, what I would say positive cash flow from development in the sense that the product cost right now is greater than the capital you need to put back in the business. And given the level of inventory that we have, I see that continuing in the near term."

Airline ticket has moved meaningfully, I think, particularly the marginal ticket for a leisure traveler. And generally, I think we're seeing that there has not been an impact from either the cost of the airline ticket or gas prices so far. Maybe a more precise way of saying that is that whatever impact exists there has been swamped by the fact that the consumer is feeling more confident and therefore, they're more active than they were a year ago. And so net-net, we still come out with growing leisure business and I suspect we'll see that, that continues through the height of leisure season this year. In other words, that whatever dampening under the surface makes just because of gas prices, we've still got a stronger consumer net of that than we would have had a year ago."

There was a little bit of impact in Q1 from those things but really not very significant. To some extent, we would see a relatively greater strength in Europe and Asia as mostly offsetting those, which is why we're more or less at the same place on sort of earnings for the full year and mostly in the same place as far as it relates to REVPAR guidance. We do have some issues that we're going to wrestle with that we've long known and have been factored into our guidance.

But if you look at core G&A this year compared to last year and adjust for whatever reserves worked out with last year or whatever else is coming through the model, I think in getting directly to your question, G&A will be up year-over-year. And I think we talked about 3% to 5% growth in G&A a quarter ago. We would probably tend to today believe that the core G&A rate is probably about the same maybe towards the higher end of that range. And that's driven by the things we referred to in the script. So a bit of that is investing in international growth, which we're really excited about. That we are adding people and we've got some initiatives underway to do things like the Fairfield brand in India and Brazil and elsewhere and those things are expensive. And then some other investing in the brands, which we are stepping up a bit. Those will be the primary drivers beyond the normal inflation factors in compensation and the like."

So the biggest group hotels are going to tend to have the longest lead time in terms of their group bookings. And they could easily be starting a year like 2011 with 75% of the group business that's been booked in prior years. Hotels which have group business but tend to have smaller, more corporate meetings probably would have a meaningfully smaller percentage of that. But I think on an average for the Marriott brand, we would say, it's in the 65% range, something like that of group bookings that would be on the books at the beginning of the year for that year. In many respects, it's not at all surprising. You look at something like association business as an example. 2011 is the time when that association business that would have been booked in the heart of the recession, when we were all sitting at our coffee pots and wondering about the financial meltdown and watching Lehman Brothers and all the rest of it, that was the time when the big association meetings, which would be held in 2011 would have been put on the books. Some meaningful percentage of them. And so in a sense, we are suffering the consequences in the group space for that recession now in 2011. I think as we look at the way group bookings are coming in, we are quite gratified. And in fact, they show that the recovery is taking place in that space, too. To be fair, our bookings in January and February were stronger than they were in March. We're not entirely sure that we can give you an explanation for that right now. But you look at the last number of months and you even look at the way things are going now, we feel really good about the way group business is coming back. That will obviously ultimately pay benefits in the balance of 2011 but also 2012 and 2013 as well."

But even with that said, we have substantial cash left. And as we've done in the past, we return that to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. And we like share repurchase given our ability to move the lever, so to speak. So I think we'll continue with that same philosophy for the rest of this year and going forward."

This is still a significant change in the way we're arrayed against our customers as opposed to arrayed by hotel. And so it takes a while for these markets to stabilize and to make sure that we've got true comparisons. We are obviously in active conversation with our owners and franchisees about the way this program is going. You were talking about hundreds and hundreds of hotels that are impacted by it. There hasn't been a program that we've ever done that applies 100% positively for every single hotel. And so we've been tweaking and calibrating and doing some other things. But generally, what we're seeing is encouraging in the sense that we're taking meaningful market share where we're stabilized. I didn't talk about this, but when you get to a large collection of hotels, in every given year, market share is moving up and down for many hotels in the portfolio. And so when we're taking share, we may be seeing 55% of the hotels going up and 45% of them going down. Every hotel has got its own story, and that story is driven by renovation activity, product quality, new supply in the market, what's happening with renovations with competitors and of course, the inherent brand strength and the like. What we're seeing with this sales transformation though is a meaningfully higher number of hotels are taking share with the stabilized markets. And again, our customers are giving us good feedback. We'll continue to be very carefully talking with our owners and working this through. And we don't want to sit here this morning and say that we're done and that victory is totally accomplished. But we're really encouraged by the way this has gone so far and feel like ultimately, this will prove to be what we anticipate, which will be a very powerful driver of market force and enhance customer loyalty and customer market share."

Special guests today are Steve Weisz, who will be President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott Vacations Worldwide; and John Geller, who will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Marriott Vacations Worldwide.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 14, 2011 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. 
One special clarification as we start the call this morning. Unfortunately, we have 2 press releases that are out there this morning. The correct press release went out on PR Newswire and by fax and was filed with the SEC late yesterday. An earlier draft of the press release was posted on our corporate website. That has since been taken down and replaced with the accurate and current press release. For those of you who pulled the press release off our corporate website last night, you should presume you've got the wrong one and make sure that you get the right one, and of course, we are standing by today to take your calls and to make sure that you got the correct press release. We apologize for any confusion with the posting of that earlier draft may have caused. 
One year ago, at the NYU Hospitality Conference, I was asked about the prospect for the U.S. lodging industry. I responded that I was wildly optimistic. At the time, there was considerable uncertainty about the pace of the recovery but the long-term opportunity was obvious. More recently, I was asked by an investor if I was still wildly optimistic. While uncertainty is still very much in the picture, given recent mixed economic news and ongoing world events, I remain very bullish about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry in general and for Marriott in particular. With strong demand and a prospect for low-supply growth, we are marching steadily towards a return to peak 2007 REVPAR. 
Returns to 2007  peak profitability per room for our owners and for Marriott will take a bit longer, but as profitability improves and we consider the contribution of the roughly 100,000 net additional rooms we have added to our systems since 2007, to say nothing of the 30,000-plus rooms we opened each year going forward, the earnings potential of Marriott is ample cause for significant optimism. 
We've come a long way over that last year. Transient business is back in a big way. The 2011 transient occupancy rate for the Marriott brand increased 3.5 percentage points, reaching 2007 peak Transient occupancy levels this quarter. Overall, Transient REVPAR rose 7% for company-operated Marriotts in North America. Systemwide REVPAR for our limited service hotels in North America increased about 7%, on top of a roughly 5% improvement in 2010. 
Second quarter results in international markets reflected a combination of economic recovery in developed countries and extraordinary economic growth in emerging markets. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, international REVPAR increased over 12% or nearly 18%, including the currency impact. 
We opened over 32,000 rooms in the last 12 months, roughly a 4.5% net unit growth rate. Our development pipeline increased to more than 100,000 rooms, with nearly 40% of our rooms in the full service pipeline in China and India. Our development pipeline in China grew by over 25% in the last 3 months alone. Later this year, we expect to introduce a newly-designed Courtyard prototype specifically tailored for the Chinese market, which should further accelerate our development in that country. 
Our Autograph brand is breaking records. Autograph REVPAR, not included in our comparable REVPAR statistics, rose an amazing 19% for the 3 months ending in May, with REVPAR index up 8 points, our fastest launch ever in just 16 months, we've added 20 hotels to the collection, including 4 Autographs in Europe, and we expect to have about 40 properties opened or signed by year end 2011. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the second quarter, and Marriott International's adjusted pretax margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, also improved, reaching close to 24% in the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year.  
And finally, we are returning cash to our shareholders, a lot of cash. Year-to-date, we have returned over $700 million in share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, and we remain committed to do more. 
We're very proud of our second quarter accomplishments. The foundations of these successes were laid long ago. We began our journey to the asset light in 1973 when we signed our first hotel management agreement. Since then, we've grown our system from 11,000 rooms to over 630,000 rooms and increased net income twenty-fold. 
Several key strategies contributed to our success. First, our brands are outstanding. We ensure our brand stay current and deliver value to our guests by frequent renovations and repositions. We tailor new brands and designs to local customers around the world, most recently in India, China, Brazil and Spain. 
Second, high-quality contracts support high-quality brands. Our management franchise agreements are long and stable, typically with initial terms of 20 to 30 years. Brand standards are an important element of every contract. In this industry, poorly-positioned hotels and short-term or terminable contracts can have a lingering negative impact. We want to ensure that each hotel and each relationship enhances the value of our system and bring strong value to us, to our customers and to our owners. 
Third, successful lodging brands need to grow. Guest preference for our brand can't be maintained if the guests cannot find their favorite hotel in the markets where they travel. We've averaged about 4.5% net rooms growth annually for the past 10 years, and we continue to add hotels even in the U.S. where supply growth is very low. 
Fourth and related to number 3, tied-up capital and permanent real estate investment slows growth and depresses ROIC. So we are selective in our use of Marriott capital, and we recycle our investments as a regular practice. As a result, we generated considerable amount of our cash over time. In the nearly 40 years since we signed our first management agreement, we have returned over $12 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, not to mention the value we have delivered to our shareholders through spinoffs and substantial capital appreciation. 
Fundamentally, the foundation of our company is based on our people: service culture, brand commitment, innovation and our long-term focus on owner and shareholder returns. Ultimately, these are why we and our owners have greater opportunities for growth ahead. To say more about the second quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist. Carl?"

We're about $0.01 favorable to the midpoint of our $0.34 to $0.38 paper guidance. Fee revenue was about $0.01 shy, largely related to weaker-than-expected REVPAR in the D.C. market. Timeshare sales and services net was about $0.02 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. We expect about half of this shortfall will turn around later this year and the remainder next year. 
On the plus side, G&A was about $0.02 better than expected due to several nonroutine items, including a reversal of an earlier loan loss provision. Our tax line contributed about $0.01 favorable, associated with some discrete tax items, and our ongoing share repurchases contributed about $0.01. 
North American Transient demand was very strong in the second quarter. Systemwide North American REVPAR rose 6.6%, with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in Southern Florida, Houston, San Francisco and the California Desert. 
In the past 2 years, one of the strongest markets had been Washington D.C. Even in the second quarter, REVPAR was ahead of the 2007 peak levels. At the same time, second quarter D.C. systemwide REVPAR rose only 1%, reflecting the short and congressional calendar, ongoing budget battle and hesitant federal agencies reluctant to book near-term group business. 
And Washington is an important market to us. Approximately 5% of our domestic systemwide room are located in the greater Washington D.C. market, considerably higher than the industry's contemplation. And the market is more important to us than even the room's distribution implies.  In 2010, approximately 6% of our worldwide fee revenue came from this market and 13% of our incentive fees. Based on our long experience in this market though, Washington is also very resilient, and we remain very optimistic about its long-term prospects. 
Across North America, second quarter group REVPAR at the Marriott brand increased 2% year-over-year. Our sales executives are doing a great job. Group bookings made in the second quarter for later in 2011 increased 18%, and long-term group bookings are returning. In the second quarter, we booked business for 2012 that was 19% higher than the prior year, and booked business for 2013 was 13% higher. In fact, nearly 1/4 of the group business booked in our second quarter were for the years 2014 and beyond. 
I'll stop at margins in the second quarter where domestic company-operated properties rose 100 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy and room rates. In international markets, gross profit margins benefited from strong REVPAR in most markets, increasing 160 basis points, excluding the Middle East and Japan markets. With good cost controls, we expect domestic cost profit margins increased 100 to 125 basis points, and international margins to increase roughly 150 basis points for the full year, and that's excluding the impact of the Middle East and Japan. 
Fee revenue rose 11% in the second quarter, with incentive fees up 9%. Incentive fee growth year-over-year was constrained by modestly lower incentive fees in the D.C. market and declines in incentive fees at hotels in the Middle East. Our owned and leased profits declined $2 million during -- due to lower hotel termination fees year-over-year and lower results at our leased hotels in Tokyo. Elsewhere, owned and leased hotels reported stronger results. 
For our Timeshare business, second quarter contract sales were a bit ahead of expectations. Compared to the prior year, Timeshare sales and services net declined due to lower interest income, and to a lesser extent, higher product costs. Compared to our expectations, lower Timeshare sales and services net reflected higher sales and marketing costs, as well as delays in revenue recognition associated with certain special promotions. 
G&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting higher nonroutine workout costs, legal costs and approximately $3 million in expenses associated with the spinoff transaction. G&A also reflected higher costs associated with our international growth and routine compensation. 
Compared to our guidance, G&A was about $5 million to $10 million better than expected in the second quarter, largely due to our $5 million reversal of a loan loss provision and lower-than-expected workout costs, which we now believe will occur later in the year. 
Let's turn to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth, even excluding the Middle East, is likely to slow a bit in the third quarter from the second quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a top comp for our Shanghai hotel later this year. REVPAR growth in Europe is expected to moderate in the second half due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany as well as tougher comparables. As a result, for the third quarter, we expect international systemwide REVPAR growth to total 6% to 8%, and that's excluding the Middle East and Japan. 
Given these trends for the full year, we expect international REVPAR to increase 7% to 9%, excluding the Middle East and Japan, a bit higher than last quarter's guidance due to the strong first half performance. 
With relatively more leisure in the third quarter, we expect North American systemwide REVPAR growth up 5% to 7%. We expect the fourth quarter to be modestly stronger, and therefore on a full year basis, still expect 6% to 8% REVPAR growth. 
For our Timeshare business in the third quarter, we expect contract sales to run slightly ahead of last year's adjusted levels. We assume Timeshare sales and services net to total $40 million to $45 million, with continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. We expect Timeshare segment results to total $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect contract sales to be slightly lower than the prior year adjusted amount. We assume Timeshare sales and services net to total about $205 million to $215 million. This is about $10 million lower than our prior full year expectations. About $5 million of this profit decline is related to lower revenue reportability, which we expect will be offset by higher reportability in '12. The other $5 million of the profit decline is mainly related to start-up costs for our banking and borrowing points and the Marriott Vacation Club points program. We expect Timeshare segments results to total about $140 million to $150 million for 2011. 
We expect our G&A expense for the full year to increase about 6% to 8% over adjusted levels in the prior year. This forecast reflects the -- reflects the nonroutine costs we talked about earlier, as well as higher spending for brand initiatives and the costs of our international growth market. 
Our full year G&A guidance is modestly higher than our forecast from last quarter, largely due to nearly $5 million in transaction expenses associated with the Timeshare spinoff recognized through the second quarter. We expect additional spinoff transactions in the second half, which could be material and which have not been included in our guidance. 
On this basis, for the full year, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 24% over the prior year adjusted EPS. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 9% to 13% compared to last year's adjusted amount. For simplicity, this guidance assumes the split will not occur until year end 2011 and again excludes future spinoff transaction costs. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We recently negotiated a 5-year extension to our bank revolver, which now has $1.75 billion of total capacity and doesn't mature until 2016. We repurchased over 18 million shares for over $675 million through the second quarter. We expect to remain aggressive, given our recent stock price and substantial investment capacity. 
Now to provide more details about the Vacation Ownership business and the pending transaction, I'd like to turn things over to Steve Weisz. Steve?"

As we prepare to be an independent company, we've put a lot of thought into our future strategy. In our view, no one does vacation ownership better. We market our products by leveraging the strongest lodging brands and a world-class sales force. We execute against high customer expectations with outstanding products and services that encourages customers to buy yet more product.  And as a result, our more than 400,000 customers are very loyal and highly satisfied. 
We believe an independent Marriott Vacations worldwide will be attractive to shareholders for several reasons. First, we will be the largest public pure-play vacation ownership business. We have a highly skilled management team with an outstanding track record focused on this attractive business and an early stage of a recovery. 
Second, we see upside in the business. We are still in the early stages of the rollout of our Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Program. We continue to sign up existing owners, and our average contract sale continues to increase so there is still considerable upside as the program continues to gain traction with new owners. 
Third, we have strong liquidity and modest nonsecuritized debt. We recently demonstrated our resiliency in the deepest recessions with good cost control and strong cash flow, and further, we are well positioned to thrive regardless of the economic climate. 
Fourth, while we recognize the vacation ownership has historically been a capital-intensive business, our cash needs in the near term are quite modest. We have $1.3 billion of inventory, including $600 million of finished goods inventory. This will minimize our capital needs for the next few years. 
We also believe we can generate cash flow over time from the sale of excess assets, including some very attractive beachfront real estate. In fact, we expect to generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow for the foreseeable future. As our inventory declines over time, we intend to pursue asset-light expansion opportunities. We expect to leverage our management know-how to manage Timeshare operations for other brands and/or develop ancillary businesses to drive high margin recurring and stable revenues. We also expect to be able to develop new resorts by distressed inventory or enter into turnkey projects with third-party developers. Ours will be a resourceful and nimble company. It will quickly seize opportunities presented to us. 
We know there are many questions about the appropriate valuation for this new company. We're working on pro forma numbers for our new Timeshare company and expect to have forecast available when we do our roadshow this fall. For valuation, we recommend a sum of the parts approach given that we expect to have a material portion of our cash flow coming from strong and sustainable management fees and net financing income, as well as our development business. 
We look forward to meeting with as many of you as possible early this fall. With that, I'll turn things back to Arne."

But I think the guidance we're giving you is essentially a constant dollar guidance.  And so by and large, we're not trying to get into the currency forecasting business and give you currency-adjusted REVPAR numbers. With respect to the Middle East and D.C., Middle East, Japan and D.C. Let's start with D.C., which is more material to us than the Middle East and Japan are. D.C., as we mentioned a quarter ago, our distribution in D.C. is a bit over 2x the industry's distribution in D.C. So it moves a bit larger for our average statistics. We have been a bit disappointed so far the balance of the year to see D.C. essentially performing flat to last year. Carl mentioned the good news in D.C., which is that it's one of the market which is at about at peak REVPAR and not surprisingly, that's because the business of government and security and national defense and all that has been a relatively robust part of our economy for the last number of years and was not hit nearly as bad in the recession as many other aspects of the U.S. economy. I think now we would say that we expect D.C. to continue to bump along at kind of flat levels through the balance of the year, and that's implicit in our guidance. We have not really talked about 2012 yet, and we don't have any budgets or anything else that gives us tremendous insight into 2012. So without the benefit of a careful look at group business on the books and some of those things, it's hard to give you a real clear number. But I would guess that the budget conversations and threats to the federal budget, as well as the presidential election, which will increasingly take center stage next year, neither of those are great fins for business in D.C. for 2012.  And so we would get the D.C. is going to continue to be a fairly modest market, at least in terms of year-over-year performance. Middle East and Japan are obviously very different markets. Japan is -- we've got the leading hotel from a REVPAR perspective in Tokyo, which is the Ritz-Carlton. And it has suffered as many hotels in Japan have, both because of less inbound travel by the intercontinental traveler, and beyond that, by a sense of reduced economic activity and maybe a even a little sense of mourning in Japan. We're starting to see some of those trends reverse. So the F&B business, for example, essentially disappeared early after the earthquake and tsunami. We're starting to see some signs of life in that and see that come back. We're seeing occupancy build. But we expect that even in the fourth quarter, we will be -- oh I suspect on average 20% to 30% REVPAR down from the fourth quarter of 2010. Now that's a lot better than where we've been since the early months of the post-disaster over there but still a long way to where we were before. Middle East, very different markets. I think Egypt, I was there a few weeks ago, that's to see our team, you get a sense for what's going on in the ground there. Egypt is a fabulous destination, and there's every reason to believe that it will come back. Many markets in D.C. though are -- excuse me, in Egypt are driven by wholesalers, often coming out of Europe. That Wholesale business is not likely to come back with significance, and so there has been sustained stability in that market. We haven't seen that yet, and so we would both expect in the guidance that we've given and as a predictive matter, that Egypt is probably a 12- to 18-month recovery story. It's not a 3- to 6-month recovery story. Other markets in the Middle East are very different so you look at Dubai. Dubai has net benefited in some respects from this. Bahrain is obviously quite weak. We're not in Syria but we are in Jordan. Jordan is not as bad as Egypt and in many respects is more stable. But generally, I think implicit in our guidance is a pretty slow recovery for the region as a whole."

So a year or 18 months or 2 years, probably worse case from now, we're looking at most markets in the United States being to peak REVPAR. But that's not enough to get us back to peak profitability, either for hotel owners or for Marriott.  And obviously, our models differ a little bit. We're going to be fee-driven. They're going to be driven by the profit margins in those hotels.  And that's what's going to take a little bit longer. I don't have a date for you on that but we would have a reasonably high level of confidence as we would have in prior cycles that within a couple of years or so after peak REVPAR, we should be approaching in many markets peak profitability.

If anything, we've been very heartened by the strength of leisure business. Now let's back up and state the obvious. Leisure travel is more price-sensitive than business travel, surprise, surprise. Notwithstanding that, I think most of the leisure business, which is driven in our hotels, is probably coming out of the higher wealth demographic as a consequence that a persistent high unemployment, the weakness in the construction trades and the like is probably less relevant currently than what we're seeing in leisure demand. But leisure demand is going to be more influenced by pricing and by consumer sentiment and those sorts of things. And as a consequence, we see it be a little bit weaker but still pretty healthy on a year-over-year basis and are quite gratified by what we've seen so far. I think all things considered, what we're communicating today is a steady as she goes report. What we see is a broad recovery that's underway. It is playing out in many respects the way exactly we would expect it to play out. So business trends in travel is the strongest, showing great performance year-over-year both in terms of pricing and in terms of volume. We're seeing group bookings build steadily, and Carl gave you some of the statistics. We're up -- bookings in Q2 were up anywhere from up roughly 15% to roughly 20% depending on whether you're looking at bookings for Q3 or Q4 in 2012 or 2013, et cetera. Good healthy year-over-year growth and good leisure performance.  And so we made very much to be reiterating the high-single-digits 6% to 8% REVPAR growth that we've talked about a quarter ago. And we'd really not add any caution with the exception of the stories we've talked about in Middle East, Japan and D.C. And to state the obvious, we are reading the same newspapers that you all are reading, and if some of these newspapers lead to slower GDP growth than any of us anticipated, that will have an impact ultimately on business travel and the rest of it but we're not seeing that show up in our business today."

When we look at the Q2 stayed and paid, and that's what that roughly 2% growth is looking at. Again, it's not looking at bookings in Q2 but it's looking at bookings that came in the books. It shouldn't surprise you to know that the weakest business was the business that was booked 2 and 3 years ago. So when we look at business booked 2 years ago stayed in our second quarter, it was down almost 10%. It shouldn't surprise you because 2 years ago, we were really wrestling with fairly dark days in the economy. 3 years ago wasn't quite as bad, even though actually, if you look at the stock market, the stock market was probably worse 3 years ago than it was 2 years ago, and that's probably a little bit that folks making decisions about group business are not responding necessarily to what they see on the Dow that day, but a little bit it take some time for them to react. And so when we look instead at business booked more recently, it is meaningfully better than those weak numbers. But again fundamentally, and this is in the prepared comments, we talked about it a couple of quarters ago, it takes a while to build the book of group business. And as a consequence, we're not surprised to see it, the stayed and paid REVPAR group numbers lower than the Transient numbers, and we do expect that those will build over time as we get the benefit of that plus 15% to 20% group revenue booked in Q2 as it ultimately shows up in our hotels."

And for GAAP reporting, you also need to cover your first aid benefits or some sales incentives that we get to customers at the closing table. In the second quarter, for example, we ran some sales incentives and offered some higher first aid benefits.  And as a result, we didn't have that 10% down for GAAP. So some of those sales, even though our sales for the second quarter, at least for Timeshare were flat year-over-year, our deferred revenue was slightly higher for the quarter because of some of that.

And the short answer is we're not losing share to our competitors. So when you look at the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, and we'll focus -- I'll focus my comments on that brand, which is obviously, substantial for us and bellwether brand for us. We build our REVPAR index by hotel, with each hotel looking at typically 5 or 6 hotels, which would be within its competitive set. Overwhelmingly, those hotels are in the same market. Occasionally, you'll find a resort hotel which might have a hotel that's outside of it, same geographic market, but 98%, I suppose,  of the MHR hotels, their competitive sets will be entirely located within the same geography. Every period or every month, we report, as do most of our competitors in the United States, this is less the case outside the United States to Smith Travel.  And Smith Travel spits back the result of all of that data and tells us whether we are taking or losing share. Since the recession began in late 2007 or early 2008, the Marriott brand has taken about 4 points of index which is massive. Why did it take index? Well hopefully, a part of it is because of great things we're doing around customer-focused things, around product-focused things, about brand innovation, about renovations and the like. But clearly, we were also helped by the cyclicality of group business where we had group business on the books more than our competitors did because we're bigger shops and benefited from some of those bookings that were done before the recession hit.  And as a consequence, our REVPAR did not decline as much as the average Smith Travel did. Now as we look at 2011 year-to-date and we adjust for renovations, we see that the MHR brand is down a few tenths of one percentage point. We think that, that is actually pretty encouraging because of this cyclicality in group business that we know to occur at this state of the recovery. In many respects, we would expect to be losing -- losing share that could be measurable and a few tenths of one point, there's not volatility in these numbers that it's effectively nearly 0. And so as we sit here today, we have tremendous confidence, not only that we have taken massive share over the last 3 or 4 years, but that we are competing very well.  And what's driving the difference in these headline numbers is, by and large, a function of geographic distribution of these hotels and not a function of any share index performance."

And you'd have to go and look at data to see about how those markets perform exactly and how they perform to the first couple of quarters this year. The suburban piece though, I think, is going to be significant. So a quarter ago, we've talked about D.C. hotels, and I think one of our competitors came out and said, ""Well, we own a hotel in D.C. and it didn't do so badly."" We've got 100 hotels in D.C. and the JW Marriott Downtown at 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue owned by Host, great hotel. I don't have the performance of every hotel right here in front of me but the Downtown hotel in Washington, which is trading at a higher end performed better in the second quarter than the average across the market because you look at Crystal City, which is going to be dominated by government business, it's going to have big competing hotels in Crystal City, and that's going to be a much more hard hit area than the JW Marriott hotel or the Ritz-Carlton on the west side of Washington D.C.  And unless you look at this competitive set data, the REVPAR index data, you're not getting anything meaningful by looking at the performance of MHR against Smith Travel's upper upscale because you're going to be comparing apples and oranges."

First of all, on the contract sales side, if you look at our Timeshare, let's leave the fractional and the whole ownership residential piece out. In the second quarter, we did exactly what we did in 2010. So the deferred piece that John referred to is not the fact that we had sales in the second quarter that won't be reportable until the first quarter of 2012. It's the fact that the second quarter sales might be reportable in Q3 or Q4. But if you continue doing the kinds of promotions which we believe we will be doing at least in the near term, that some of the sales that will happen in Q3 or Q4 will spill over into Q1 of next year. So it's just kind of the cascading effect of that. And so I think that's the first answer to your question. The second answer to your question is 39% of our sales year-to-date are to first-time buyers, which implies a 61% are obviously to our existing customers. That's been very deliberate on our part. We have -- we made it a focus, we made it a strategic decision that when we launched the points business in June of 2010, that we really wanted to get in front of every single one of our existing owners to try to help them understand the relative merits of them joining Marriott Vacation Club Destinations. So as we have allocated to our flow and trying to, in fact, take advantage of talking to people while they're on vacation at our resorts, we have squeezed out towards the first-time buyers. That was very deliberate, and we said we would do that. As we start to move further into this year, now having a year behind us, we will have talked to a lot of those customers. We would expect that over time, that we will start to see the percentage of first-time buyers come back to a more normalized percentage. You may recall that roughly 50% of our business over the years has been to first-time buyers, and roughly 50% of our business has been to existing owners and their referrals. So I think it's -- what we've seen is playing out exactly what we wanted to do. We're very pleased with the receptiveness that our existing owners have had to joining Marriott Vacation Club Destinations, our Points Program. And we're not at all concerned about the long-term implications of that."

Special guests today are Steve Weisz, who will be President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott Vacations Worldwide; and John Geller, who will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Marriott Vacations Worldwide.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 14, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. 
One special clarification as we start the call this morning. Unfortunately, we have 2 press releases that are out there this morning. The correct press release went out on PR Newswire and by fax and was filed with the SEC late yesterday. An earlier draft of the press release was posted on our corporate website. That has since been taken down and replaced with the accurate and current press release. For those of you who pulled the press release off our corporate website last night, you should presume you've got the wrong one and make sure that you get the right one. And of course, we are standing by today to take your calls and to make sure that you've got the correct press release. We apologize for any confusion that the posting of that earlier draft may have caused. 
One year ago, at the NYU Hospitality Conference, I was asked about the prospects for the U.S. lodging industry. I responded that I was wildly optimistic. At the time, there was considerable uncertainty about the pace of the recovery but the long-term opportunity was obvious. More recently, I was asked by an investor if I was still wildly optimistic. While uncertainty is still very much in the picture, given recent mixed economic news and ongoing world events, I remain very bullish about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry in general and for Marriott in particular. With strong demand and a prospect for low-supply growth, we are marching steadily towards a return to peak 2007 REVPAR. 
Returns to 2007 peak profitability per room for our owners and for Marriott will take a bit longer, but as profitability improves and we consider the contribution of the roughly 100,000 net additional rooms we have added to our systems since 2007, to say nothing of the 30,000-plus rooms we opened each year going forward, the earnings potential of Marriott is ample cause for significant optimism. 
We've come a long way over the last year. Transient business is back in a big way. The 2011 transient occupancy rate for the Marriott brand increased 3.5 percentage points, reaching 2007 peak transient occupancy levels this quarter. Overall, transient REVPAR rose 7% for company-operated Marriotts in North America. Systemwide REVPAR for our limited service hotels in North America increased about 7%, on top of a roughly 5% improvement in 2010. 
Second quarter results in international markets reflected a combination of economic recovery in developed countries and extraordinary economic growth in emerging markets. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, international REVPAR increased over 12% or nearly 18%, including the currency impact. 
We opened over 32,000 rooms in the last 12 months, roughly a 4.5% net unit growth rate. Our development pipeline increased to more than 100,000 rooms, with nearly 40% of our rooms in the full-service pipeline in China and India. Our development pipeline in China grew by over 25% in the last 3 months alone. Later this year, we expect to introduce a newly designed Courtyard prototype specifically tailored for the Chinese market, which should further accelerate our development in that country. 
Our Autograph brand is breaking records. Autograph REVPAR, not included in our comparable REVPAR statistics, rose an amazing 19% for the 3 months ending in May, with REVPAR index up 8 points, our fastest launch ever in just 16 months. We've added 20 hotels to the collection, including 4 Autographs in Europe, and we expect to have about 40 properties opened or signed by year end 2011. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the second quarter, and Marriott International's adjusted pretax margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, also improved, reaching close to 24% in the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year. 
 
And finally, we are returning cash to our shareholders, a lot of cash. Year-to-date, we have returned over $700 million in share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, and we remain committed to do more. 
We're very proud of our second quarter accomplishments. The foundations of these successes were laid long ago. We began our journey to the asset light in 1973 when we signed our first hotel management agreement. Since then, we've grown our system from 11,000 rooms to over 630,000 rooms and increased net income twentyfold. 
Several key strategies contributed to our success. First, our brands are outstanding. We ensure our brands stay current and deliver value to our guests by frequent renovations and repositionings. We tailor new brands and designs to local customers around the world, most recently in India, China, Brazil and Spain. 
Second, high-quality contracts support high-quality brands. Our management franchise agreements are long and stable, typically with initial terms of 20 to 30 years. Brand standards are an important element of every contract. In this industry, poorly positioned hotels and short-term or terminable contracts can have a lingering negative impact. We want to ensure that each hotel and each relationship enhances the value of our system and bring strong value to us, to our customers and to our owners. 
Third, successful lodging brands need to grow. Guest preference for our brand can't be maintained if the guests cannot find their favorite hotel in the markets where they travel. We've averaged about 4.5% net rooms growth annually for the past 10 years, and we continue to add hotels even in the U.S. where supply growth is very low. 
Fourth and related to number three, tied-up capital and permanent real estate investment slows growth and depresses ROIC. So we are selective in our use of Marriott capital, and we recycle our investments as a regular practice. As a result, we generated considerable amount of cash over time. In the nearly 40 years since we signed our first management agreement, we have returned over $12 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, not to mention the value we have delivered to our shareholders through spinoffs and substantial capital appreciation. 
Fundamentally, the foundation of our company is based on our people, service culture, brand commitment, innovation and our long-term focus on owner and shareholder returns. Ultimately, these are why we and our owners have greater opportunities for growth ahead. To say more about the second quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist. Carl?"

We're about $0.01 favorable to the midpoint of our $0.34 to $0.38 favorable guidance. Fee revenue was about $0.01 shy, largely related to weaker-than-expected REVPAR in the D.C. market. Timeshare sales and services net was about $0.02 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. We expect about half of this shortfall will turn around later this year and the remainder next year. 
On the plus side, G&A was about $0.02 better than expected due to several nonroutine items, including a reversal of an earlier loan loss provision. Our tax line contributed about $0.01 favorable, associated with some discrete tax items, and our ongoing share repurchases contributed about $0.01. 
North American Transient demand was very strong in the second quarter. Systemwide North American REVPAR rose 6.6%, with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in Southern Florida, Houston, San Francisco and the California Desert. 
In the past 2 years, one of the strongest markets had been Washington, D.C. Even in the second quarter, REVPAR was ahead of the 2007 peak levels. At the same time, second quarter D.C. systemwide REVPAR rose only 1%, reflecting the short and congressional calendar, ongoing budget battle and hesitant federal agencies reluctant to book near-term group business. 
And Washington is an important market to us. Approximately 5% of our domestic systemwide rooms are located in the greater Washington, D.C. market, considerably higher than the industry's concentration. And the market is more important to us than even the room's distribution implies.  In 2010, approximately 6% of our worldwide fee revenue came from this market and 13% of our incentive fees. Based on our long experience in this market though, Washington is also very resilient, and we remain very optimistic about its long-term prospects. 
Across North America, second quarter group REVPAR at the Marriott brand increased 2% year-over-year. Our sales executives are doing a great job. Group bookings made in the second quarter for later in 2011 increased 18%, and long-term group bookings are returning. In the second quarter, we booked business for 2012 that was 19% higher than the prior year and booked business for 2013 that was 13% higher. In fact, nearly 1/4 of the group business booked in our second quarter were for the years 2014 and beyond. 
I'll stop at margins in the second quarter where domestic company-operated properties rose 100 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy and room rates. In international markets, gross profit margins benefited from strong REVPAR in most markets, increasing 160 basis points, excluding the Middle East and Japan markets. With good cost controls, we expect domestic cost profit margins to increase 100 to 125 basis points and international margins to increase roughly 150 basis points for the full year, and that's excluding the impact of the Middle East and Japan. 
Fee revenue rose 11% in the second quarter, with incentive fees up 9%. Incentive fee growth year-over-year was constrained by modestly lower incentive fees in the D.C. market and declines in incentive fees at the hotels in the Middle East. Our owned and leased profits declined $2 million during -- due to lower hotel termination fees year-over-year and lower results at our leased hotels in Tokyo. Elsewhere, owned and leased hotels reported stronger results. 
For our Timeshare business, second quarter contract sales were a bit ahead of expectations. Compared to the prior year, Timeshare sales and services, net, declined due to lower interest income, and to a lesser extent, higher product costs. Compared to our expectations, lower Timeshare sales and services, net, reflected higher sales and marketing costs, as well as delays in revenue recognition associated with certain special promotions. 
G&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting higher nonroutine workout costs, legal costs and approximately $3 million in expenses associated with the spinoff transaction. G&A also reflected higher costs associated with our international growth and routine compensation. Compared to our guidance, G&A was about $5 million to $10 million better than expected in the second quarter, largely due to our $5 million reversal of a loan loss provision and lower-than-expected workout costs, which we now believe will occur later in the year. 
Let's turn to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth, even excluding the Middle East, is likely to slow a bit in the third quarter from the second quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a top comp for our Shanghai hotel later this year. REVPAR growth in Europe is expected to moderate in the second half due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany, as well as tougher comparables. As a result, for the third quarter, we expect international systemwide REVPAR growth to total 6% to 8%, and that's excluding the Middle East and Japan. Given these trends for the full year, we expect international REVPAR to increase 7% to 9%, excluding the Middle East and Japan, a bit higher than last quarter's guidance due to the strong first half performance. 
With relatively more leisure in the third quarter, we expect North American systemwide REVPAR growth up 5% to 7%. We expect the fourth quarter to be modestly stronger and therefore on a full year basis, still expect 6% to 8% REVPAR growth. 
For our Timeshare business in the third quarter, we expect contract sales to run slightly ahead of last year's adjusted levels. We assume Timeshare sales and services, net, to total $40 million to $45 million, with continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. We expect Timeshare segment results to total $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect contract sales to be slightly lower than the prior year adjusted amount. We assume Timeshare sales and services net to total about $205 million to $215 million. This is about $10 million lower than our prior full year expectations. About $5 million of this profit decline is related to lower revenue reportability, which we expect will be offset by higher reportability in '12. The other $5 million of the profit decline is mainly related to start-up costs for our banking and borrowing points in the Marriott Vacation Club Points Program. We expect Timeshare segment results to total about $140 million to $150 million for 2011. 
We expect our G&A expense for the full year to increase about 6% to 8% over adjusted levels in the prior year. This forecast reflects the -- reflects the nonroutine costs we talked about earlier, as well as higher spending for brand initiatives and the costs of our international growth market. 
Our full year G&A guidance is modestly higher than our forecast from last quarter, largely due to nearly $5 million in transaction expenses associated with the Timeshare spinoff recognized through the second quarter. We expect additional spinoff transactions in the second half, which could be material and which have not been included in our guidance. 
On this basis, for the full year, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 24% over the prior year adjusted EPS. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 9% to 13% compared to last year's adjusted amount. For simplicity, this guidance assumes the split will not occur until year end 2011 and again excludes future spinoff transaction costs. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We recently negotiated a 5-year extension to our bank revolver, which now has $1.75 billion of total capacity and doesn't mature until 2016. We repurchased over 18 million shares for over $675 million through the second quarter. We expect to remain aggressive, given our recent stock price and substantial investment capacity. 
Now to provide more details about the vacation ownership business and the pending transaction, I'd like to turn things over to Steve Weisz. Steve?"

As we prepare to be an independent company, we've put a lot of thought into our future strategy. In our view, no one does vacation ownership better. We market our products by leveraging the strongest lodging brands and a world-class sales force. We execute against high customer expectations with outstanding products and services that encourages customers to buy yet more product.  And as a result, our more than 400,000 customers are very loyal and highly satisfied. 
We believe an independent Marriott Vacations worldwide will be attractive to shareholders for several reasons. First, we will be the largest public pure-play vacation ownership business. We have a highly skilled management team with an outstanding track record focused on this attractive business and an early stage of a recovery. 
Second, we see upside in the business. We are still in the early stages of the rollout of our Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Program. We continue to sign up existing owners, and our average contract sale continues to increase. So there is still considerable upside as the program continues to gain traction with new owners. 
Third, we have strong liquidity and modest nonsecuritized debt. We recently demonstrated our resiliency in the deepest recessions with good cost control and strong cash flow and feel that we are well positioned to thrive regardless of the economic climate. 
Fourth, while we recognize the vacation ownership has historically been a capital-intensive business, our cash needs in the near term are quite modest. We have $1.3 billion of inventory, including $600 million of finished goods inventory. This will minimize our capital needs for the next few years. 
We also believe we can generate cash flow over time from the sale of excess assets, including some very attractive beachfront real estate. In fact, we expect to generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow for the foreseeable future. As our inventory declines over time, we intend to pursue asset-light expansion opportunities. We expect to leverage our management know-how to manage Timeshare operations for other brands and/or develop ancillary businesses to drive high margin recurring and stable revenues. We also expect to be able to develop new resorts by distressed inventory or enter into turnkey projects with third-party developers. Ours will be a resourceful and nimble company. It will quickly seize opportunities presented to us. 
We know there are many questions about the appropriate valuation for this new company. We're working on pro forma numbers for our new Timeshare company and expect to have forecast available when we do our roadshow this fall. For valuation, we recommend a ""sum of the parts"" approach given that we expect to have a material portion of our cash flow coming from strong and sustainable management fees and net financing income, as well as our development business. 
We look forward to meeting with as many of you as possible early this fall. With that, I'll turn things back to Arne."

But I think the guidance we're giving you is essentially a constant dollar guidance.  And so by and large, we're not trying to get into the currency forecasting business and give you currency-adjusted REVPAR numbers. With respect to the Middle East and D.C -- Middle East, Japan and D.C., let's start with D.C., which is more material to us than the Middle East and Japan are. D.C., as we mentioned a quarter ago, our distribution in D.C. is a bit over 2x the industry's distribution in D.C. So it moves a bit larger for our average statistics. We have been a bit disappointed so far the balance of the year to see D.C. essentially performing flat to last year. Carl mentioned the good news in D.C., which is that it's one of the markets which is about at peak REVPAR, and not surprisingly. That's because the business of government and security and national defense and all that has been a relatively robust part of our economy for the last number of years and was not hit nearly as bad in the recession as many other aspects of the U.S. economy. I think now we would say that we expect D.C. to continue to bump along at kind of flat levels through the balance of the year, and that's implicit in our guidance. We have not really talked about 2012 yet, and we don't have any budgets or anything else that gives us tremendous insight into 2012. So without the benefit of a careful look at group business on the books and some of those things, it's hard to give you a real clear number. But I would guess that the budget conversations and threats to the federal budget, as well as the presidential election, which will increasingly take center stage next year, neither of those are great fins for business in D.C. for 2012. And so we would guess the D.C. is going to continue to be a fairly modest market, at least in terms of year-over-year performance. Middle East and Japan are obviously very different markets. Japan is -- we've got the leading hotel from a REVPAR perspective in Tokyo, which is the Ritz-Carlton. And it has suffered as many hotels in Japan have, both because of less inbound travel by the intercontinental traveler, and beyond that, by a sense of reduced economic activity and maybe a even a little sense of mourning in Japan. We're starting to see some of those trends reverse. So the F&B business, for example, essentially disappeared early after the earthquake and tsunami. We're starting to see some signs of life in that and see that come back. We're seeing occupancy build. But we expect that even in the fourth quarter, we will be -- oh, I suspect, on average, 20% to 30% REVPAR down from the fourth quarter of 2010. Now that's a lot better than where we've been since the early months of the post-disaster over there but still a long way to where we were before. Middle East, very different markets. I think Egypt -- I was there a few weeks ago. That's to see our team and get a sense for what's going on in the ground there. Egypt is a fabulous destination and there's every reason to believe that it will come back. Many markets in D.C., though, are -- excuse me, in Egypt are driven by wholesalers often coming out of Europe. That wholesale business is not likely to come back with significance, and so there has been sustained stability in that market. We haven't seen that yet, and so we would both expect in the guidance that we've given and as a predictive matter that Egypt is probably a 12- to 18-month recovery story. It's not a 3- to 6-month recovery story. Other markets in the Middle East are very different. So you look at Dubai. Dubai has net benefited in some respects from this. Bahrain is obviously quite weak. We're not in Syria but we are in Jordan. Jordan is not as bad as Egypt and in many respects is more stable. But generally, I think implicit in our guidance is a pretty slow recovery for the region as a whole."

And longer refers only to in comparison to REVPAR. So when you look at the REVPAR numbers, and we've talked about D.C. a little bit in this call, obviously, D.C. is roughly at peak REVPAR already. You look at the U.S. as a whole, and clearly the U.S. as a whole is not back to peak REVPAR, but we can see it.  And it's not far out. So a year or 18 months or 2 years, probably worse case from now, we're looking at most markets in the United States being to peak REVPAR. But that's not enough to get us back to peak profitability, either for hotel owners or for Marriott.  And obviously, our models differ a little bit. We're going to be fee-driven. They're going to be driven by the profit margins in those hotels.  And that's what's going to take a little bit longer. I don't have a date for you on that but we would have a reasonably high level of confidence, as we would have in prior cycles, that within a couple of years or so after peak REVPAR, we should be approaching in many markets peak profitability.  And we look forward to seeing how that works its way through. And obviously, in the context of that, I also talked about the tremendous unit growth, which we'll also be adding certainly to our system and our profitability as we go forward."

If anything, we've been very heartened by the strength of leisure business. Now let's back up and state the obvious. Leisure travel is more price-sensitive than business travel, surprise, surprise. Notwithstanding that, I think most of the leisure business, which is driven in our hotels, is probably coming out of the higher wealth demographic as a consequence that a persistent high unemployment, the weakness in the construction trades and the like is probably less relevant currently than what we're seeing in leisure demand. But leisure demand is going to be more influenced by pricing and by consumer sentiment and those sorts of things. And as a consequence, we see it be a little bit weaker but still pretty healthy on a year-over-year basis and are quite gratified by what we've seen so far. I think all things considered, what we're communicating today is a ""steady as she goes"" report. What we see is a broad recovery that's underway. It is playing out in many respects the way exactly we would expect it to play out. So business trends in travel is the strongest, showing great performance year-over-year, both in terms of pricing and in terms of volume. We're seeing group bookings build steadily. And Carl gave you some of the statistics. We're up -- bookings in Q2 were up anywhere from up roughly 15% to roughly 20%, depending on whether you're looking at bookings for Q3 or Q4 in 2012 or 2013, et cetera. Good healthy year-over-year growth and good leisure performance.  And so we mean very much to be reiterating the high single-digit 6% to 8% REVPAR growth that we've talked about a quarter ago. And we'd really not add any caution with the exception of the stories we've talked about in Middle East, Japan and D.C. And to state the obvious, we are reading the same newspapers that you all are reading. And if some of these newspapers lead to slower GDP growth than any of us anticipated, that will have an impact ultimately on business travel and the rest of it. But we're not seeing that show up in our business today."

And that's probably a little bit that folks making decisions about group business are not responding necessarily to what they see on the Dow that day, but a little bit it takes some time for them to react. And so when we look instead at business booked more recently, it is meaningfully better than those weak numbers. But again, fundamentally, and this is in the prepared comments, we talked about it a quarter ago, it takes a while to build the book of group business. And as a consequence, we're not surprised to see it, the stayed and paid REVPAR group numbers in Q2, lower than the transient numbers. And we would expect that those will build over time as we get the benefit of that plus 15% to 20% group revenue booked in Q2 as it ultimately shows up in our hotels."

So in the past, we would have deferred revenue as we completed projects that would come in. So that's the piece that virtually is gone. From a timing perspective, quarter-to-quarter, there is still some deferred revenue and it really relates primarily to our finance sales where you're required to have 10% down. And for GAAP reporting, you also need to cover your first aid benefits or some sales incentives that we give to customers at the closing table. In the second quarter, for example, we ran some sales incentives and offered some higher first aid benefits.  And as a result, we didn't have that 10% down for GAAP. So some of those sales, even though our sales for the second quarter, at least for Timeshare, were flat year-over-year. Our deferred revenue was slightly higher for the quarter because of some of that. And we'll see that flip around here in the third and fourth quarter.

And the short answer is we're not losing share to our competitors. So when you look at the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, and we'll focus -- I'll focus my comments on that brand, which is obviously substantial for us and the bellwether brand for us. We build our REVPAR index by hotel, with each hotel looking at typically 5 or 6 hotels, which would be within its competitive set. Overwhelmingly, those hotels are in the same market. Occasionally, you'll find a resort hotel which might have a hotel that's outside of it, same geographic market. But 98%, I suppose, of the MHR hotels, their competitive sets will be entirely located within the same geography. Every period or every month, we report, as do most of our competitors in the United States, this is less the case outside the United States, to Smith Travel. And Smith Travel spits back the result of all of that data and tells us whether we are taking or losing share. Since the recession began in late 2007 or early 2008, the Marriott brand has taken about 4 points of index, which is massive. Why did it take index? Well, hopefully, a part of it is because of great things we've been doing around customer-focused things, around product-focused things, around brand innovation, about renovations and the like. But clearly, we were also helped by the cyclicality of group business where we had group business on the books more than our competitors did because we're bigger shops and benefited from some of those bookings that were done before the recession hit.  And as a consequence, our REVPAR did not decline as much as the average Smith Travel did. Now as we look at 2011 year-to-date and we adjust for renovations, we see that the MHR brand is down a few tenths of one percentage point. We think that, that is actually pretty encouraging because of this cyclicality in group business that we know to occur at this state of the recovery. In many respects, we would expect to be losing share that could be measurable and a few tenths of one point is -- there's no volatility in these numbers that it's effectively nearly 0. And so as we sit here today, we have tremendous confidence, not only that we have taken massive share over the last 3 or 4 years, but that we are competing very well.  And what's driving the difference in these headline numbers is, by and large, a function of geographic distribution of these hotels and not a function of any share index performance."

And you'd have to go and look at the data to see about how those markets perform exactly and how they perform in the first couple of quarters this year. The suburban piece though, I think, is going to be significant. So a quarter ago, we've talked about D.C. hotels, and I think one of our competitors came out and said, ""Well, we own a hotel in D.C. and it didn't do so badly."" Well, we've got 100 hotels in D.C. And the JW Marriott Downtown at 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue owned by Host, great hotel. I don't have the performance of every hotel right here in front of me but the Downtown hotel in Washington, which is trading at a higher end, performed better in the second quarter than the average across the market. Because when you look at Crystal City, which is going to be dominated by government business, it's going to have big competing hotels in Crystal City, and that's going to be a much more hard hit area than the JW Marriott hotel or the Ritz-Carlton on the west side of Washington, D.C. And unless you look at this competitive set data, the REVPAR index data, you're not getting anything meaningful by looking at the performance of MHR against Smith Travel's upper upscale because you're going to be comparing apples and oranges."

Again, I think that is a much too rough measure to look at and is essentially meaningless. The measure to look at is how are we performing against the hotels we compete against by market. And there, we're performing exceedingly well."

First of all, on the contract sales side, if you look at our Timeshare, let's leave the fractional and the whole ownership residential piece out, in the second quarter, we did exactly what we did",421,"Steve, this is Steve Weisz. Let me try to answer question. First of all, on the contract sales side, if you look at our Timeshare, let's leave the fractional and the whole ownership residential piece out, in the second quarter, we did exactly what we did in 2010. So the deferred piece that John referred to is not the fact that we had sales in the second quarter that won't be reportable until the first quarter of 2012. It's the fact that the second quarter sales might be reportable in Q3 or Q4. But if you continue doing the kinds of promotions which we believe we will be doing at least in the near term, that some of the sales that will happen in Q3 or Q4 will spill over into Q1 of next year. So it's just kind of the cascading effect of that. And so I think that's the first answer to your question. The second answer to your question is 39% of our sales year-to-date are to first-time buyers, which implies that 61% are obviously to our existing customers. That's been very deliberate on our part. We have -- we made it a focus. We made it a strategic decision that when we launched the points business in June of 2010, that we really wanted to get in front of every single one of our existing owners to try to help them understand the relative merits of them joining Marriott Vacation Club Destinations. So as we have allocated to our flow and trying to, in fact, take advantage of talking to people while they're on vacation at our resorts, we have squeezed out towards the first-time buyers. That was very deliberate, and we said we would do that. As we start to move further into this year, now having a year behind us, we will have talked to a lot of those customers. We would expect that over time, that we will start to see the percentage of first-time buyers come back to a more normalized percentage. You may recall that roughly 50% of our business over the years has been to first-time buyers and roughly 50% of our business has been to existing owners and their referrals. So I think it's -- what we've seen is playing out exactly what we wanted to do. We're very pleased with the receptiveness that our existing owners have had to joining Marriott Vacation Club Destinations, our Points Program. And we're not at all concerned about the long-term implications of that."

But I think one of the other things that as a response to your question, Steve Kent, is that a year ago and 1.5 year ago, Steve Weisz and his team were doing more with peer discounting of the pricing of the Timeshare mix. We've not only eliminated that discounting, but in many respects pound for pound, we have increased pricing.  And there is some promotional activity, which is a way of addressing a piece of that to make sure that we've still got a value proposition and a pitch for the customer that is an attractive one.  And we think that the decisions they've made in that space are good. You are not hearing Steve Weisz say or any of us say that consumer confidence is back to a level which gives us the confidence to believe that we can sell as much weekly Timeshare as we were selling in 2006 and 2007. And to get back to those levels is going to require a continuing recovery in the economy and a continuing recovery in consumer confidence. And as those things happen, we'll see that this business continues to grow. But none of us is sitting here saying we feel so good about this product that we don't have to do promotional activity and we can sort of sit back and play hard to get and the customer's going to come in and buy more of this stuff than we can produce, because that's not where we are yet in this economic recovery.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2011 earnings conference call.

Special guests today are Steve Weisz, who will be President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott Vacations Worldwide; and John Geller, who will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Marriott Vacations Worldwide.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 14, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor. 
One special clarification as we start the call this morning. Unfortunately, we have 2 press releases that are out there this morning. The correct press release went out on PR Newswire and by fax and was filed with the SEC late yesterday. An earlier draft of the press release was posted on our corporate website. That has since been taken down and replaced with the accurate and current press release. For those of you who pulled the press release off our corporate website last night, you should presume you've got the wrong one and make sure that you get the right one. And of course, we are standing by today to take your calls and to make sure that you've got the correct press release. We apologize for any confusion that the posting of that earlier draft may have caused. 
One year ago, at the NYU Hospitality Conference, I was asked about the prospects for the U.S. lodging industry. I responded that I was wildly optimistic. At the time, there was considerable uncertainty about the pace of the recovery but the long-term opportunity was obvious. More recently, I was asked by an investor if I was still wildly optimistic. While uncertainty is still very much in the picture given recent mixed economic news and ongoing world events, I remain very bullish about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry in general and for Marriott in particular. With strong demand and a prospect for low-supply growth, we are marching steadily towards a return to peak 2007 REVPAR. 
Returns to 2007 peak profitability per room for our owners and for Marriott will take a bit longer, but as profitability improves and we consider the contribution of the roughly 100,000 net additional rooms we have added to our systems since 2007, to say nothing of the 30,000-plus rooms we opened each year going forward, the earnings potential of Marriott is ample cause for significant optimism. 
We've come a long way over the last year. Transient business is back in a big way. The 2011 transient occupancy rate for the Marriott brand increased 3.5 percentage points, reaching 2007 peak transient occupancy levels this quarter. Overall, transient REVPAR rose 7% for company-operated Marriotts in North America. Systemwide REVPAR for our limited service hotels in North America increased about 7%, on top of a roughly 5% improvement in 2010. 
Second quarter results in international markets reflected a combination of economic recovery in developed countries and extraordinary economic growth in emerging markets. Excluding the Middle East and Japan, international REVPAR increased over 12% or nearly 18%, including the currency impact. 
We opened over 32,000 rooms in the last 12 months, roughly a 4.5% net unit growth rate. Our development pipeline increased to more than 100,000 rooms, with nearly 40% of our rooms in the full-service pipeline in China and India. Our development pipeline in China grew by over 25% in the last 3 months alone. Later this year, we expect to introduce a newly designed Courtyard prototype specifically tailored for the Chinese market, which should further accelerate our development in that country. 
Our Autograph brand is breaking records. Autograph REVPAR, not included in our comparable REVPAR statistics, rose an amazing 19% for the 3 months ending in May, with REVPAR index up 8 points, our fastest launch ever in just 16 months. We've added 20 hotels to the collection, including 4 Autographs in Europe, and we expect to have about 40 properties opened or signed by year-end 2011. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the second quarter, and Marriott International's adjusted pretax margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs also improved, reaching close to 24% in the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year. 
 
And finally, we are returning cash to our shareholders, a lot of cash. Year-to-date, we have returned over $700 million in share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, and we remain committed to do more. 
We're very proud of our second quarter accomplishments. The foundations of these successes were laid long ago. We began our journey to the asset light in 1973 when we signed our first hotel management agreement. Since then, we've grown our system from 11,000 rooms to over 630,000 rooms and increased net income twentyfold. 
Several key strategies contributed to our success. First, our brands are outstanding. We ensure our brands stay current and deliver value to our guests by frequent renovations and repositionings. We tailor new brands and designs to local customers around the world, most recently in India, China, Brazil and Spain. 
Second, high-quality contracts support high-quality brands. Our management franchise agreements are long and stable, typically with initial terms of 20 to 30 years. Brand standards are an important element of every contract. In this industry, poorly positioned hotels and short-term or terminable contracts can have a lingering negative impact. We want to ensure that each hotel and each relationship enhances the value of our system and bring strong value to us, to our customers and to our owners. 
Third, successful lodging brands need to grow. Guest preference for our brand can't be maintained if the guests cannot find their favorite hotel in the markets where they travel. We've averaged about 4.5% net room's growth annually for the past 10 years, and we continue to add hotels even in the U.S., where supply growth is very low. 
Fourth and related to number three, tied-up capital and permanent real estate investment slows growth and depresses ROIC. So we are selective in our use of Marriott capital, and we recycle our investments as a regular practice. As a result, we generated considerable amount of cash over time. In the nearly 40 years since we signed our first management agreement, we have returned over $12 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, not to mention the value we have delivered to our shareholders through spinoffs and substantial capital appreciation. 
Fundamentally, the foundation of our company is based on our people, service culture, brand commitment, innovation and our long-term focus on owner and shareholder returns. Ultimately, these are why we and our owners have greater opportunities for growth ahead. To say more about the second quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Berquist. Carl?"

We're about $0.01 favorable to the midpoint of our $0.34 to $0.38 favorable guidance. Fee revenue was about $0.01 shy, largely related to weaker-than-expected REVPAR in the D.C. market. Timeshare sales and services net was about $0.02 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. We expect about half of this shortfall will turn around later this year and the remainder next year. 
On the plus side, G&A was about $0.02 better than expected due to several non-routine items, including a reversal of an earlier loan loss provision. Our tax line contributed about $0.01 favorable associated with some discrete tax items, and our ongoing share repurchases contributed about $0.01. 
North American Transient demand was very strong in the second quarter. Systemwide North American REVPAR rose 6.6%, with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in Southern Florida, Houston, San Francisco and the California Desert. 
In the past 2 years, one of the strongest markets has been Washington, D.C. Even in the second quarter, REVPAR was ahead of the 2007 peak levels. At the same time, second quarter D.C. systemwide REVPAR rose only 1%, reflecting the short and congressional calendar, ongoing budget battle and hesitant federal agencies reluctant to book near-term group business. 
And Washington is an important market to us. Approximately 5% of our domestic systemwide rooms are located in the greater Washington, D.C. market, considerably higher than the industry's concentration. And the market is more important to us than even the room's distribution implies.  In 2010, approximately 6% of our worldwide fee revenue came from this market and 13% of our incentive fees. Based on our long experience in this market though, Washington is also very resilient and we remain very optimistic about its long-term prospects. 
Across North America, second quarter group REVPAR at the Marriott brand increased 2% year-over-year. Our sales executives are doing a great job. Group bookings made in the second quarter for later in 2011 increased 18%, and long-term group bookings are returning. In the second quarter, we booked business for 2012 that was 19% higher than the prior year and booked business for 2013 that was 13% higher. In fact, nearly 1/4 of the group business booked in our second quarter were for the years 2014 and beyond. 
Gross profit margins in the second quarter for domestic company-operated properties rose 100 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy and room rates. In international markets, gross profit margins benefited from strong REVPAR in most markets, increasing 160 basis points, excluding the Middle East and Japan markets. With good cost controls, we expect domestic cost profit margins to increase 100 to 125 basis points and international margins to increase roughly 150 basis points for the full year, and that's excluding the impact to the Middle East and Japan. 
Fee revenue rose 11% in the second quarter, with incentive fees up 9%. Incentive fee growth year-over-year was constrained by modestly lower incentive fees in the D.C. market and declines in incentive fees at the hotels in the Middle East. Our owned and leased profits declined $2 million during -- due to lower hotel termination fees year-over-year and lower results at our leased hotels in Tokyo. Elsewhere, owned and leased hotels reported stronger results. 
For our Timeshare business, second quarter contract sales were a bit ahead of expectations. Compared to the prior year, Timeshare sales and services net declined due to lower interest income and to a lesser extent, higher product costs. Compared to our expectations, lower Timeshare sales and services net reflected higher sales and marketing costs, as well as delays in revenue recognition associated with certain special promotions. 
G&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting higher non-routine workout costs, legal costs and approximately $3 million in expenses associated with the spinoff transaction. G&A also reflected higher costs associated with our international growth and routine compensation. Compared to our guidance, G&A was about $5 million to $10 million better than expected in the second quarter, largely due to our $5 million reversal of a loan loss provision and lower-than-expected workout costs, which we now believe will occur later in the year. 
Let's turn to guidance for the rest of the year. Our international REVPAR growth, even excluding the Middle East, is likely to slow a bit in the third quarter from the second quarter pace. The 2010 World Expo will be a top comp for our Shanghai hotel later this year. REVPAR growth in Europe is expected to moderate in the second half due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany, as well as tougher comparables. As a result, for the third quarter, we expect international systemwide REVPAR growth to total 6% to 8%, and that's excluding the Middle East and Japan. Given these trends for the full year, we expect international REVPAR to increase 7% to 9%, excluding the Middle East and Japan, a bit higher than last quarter's guidance due to the strong first half performance. 
With relatively more leisure in the third quarter, we expect North American systemwide REVPAR growth up 5% to 7%. We expect the fourth quarter to be modestly stronger and therefore on a full year basis, still expect 6% to 8% REVPAR growth. 
For our Timeshare business in the third quarter, we expect contract sales to run slightly ahead of last year's adjusted levels. We assume Timeshare sales and services net to total $40 million to $45 million, with continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. We expect Timeshare segment results to total $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect contract sales to be slightly lower than the prior year adjusted amount. We assume Timeshare sales and services net to total about $205 million to $215 million. This is about $10 million lower than our prior full year expectations. About $5 million of this profit decline is related to lower revenue reportability, which we expect will be offset by higher reportability in '12. The other $5 million of the profit decline is mainly related to start-up costs for our banking and borrowing points in the Marriott Vacation Club Points Program. We expect Timeshare segment results to total about $140 million to $150 million for 2011. 
We expect our G&A expense for the full year to increase about 6% to 8% over adjusted levels in the prior year. This forecast reflects the -- reflects the non-routine costs we talked about earlier, as well as higher spending for brand initiatives and the costs of our international growth market. 
Our full year G&A guidance is modestly higher than our forecast from last quarter, largely due to nearly $5 million in transaction expenses associated with the Timeshare spinoff recognized through the second quarter. We expect additional spinoff transactions in the second half, which could be material and which have not been included in our guidance. 
On this basis, for the full year, we expect earnings per share will increase 17% to 24% over the prior year adjusted EPS. We anticipate EBITDA will climb 9% to 13% compared to last year's adjusted amount. For simplicity, this guidance assumes the split will not occur until year-end 2011 and again excludes future spinoff transaction costs. 
We assume about $500 million to $700 million in investment spending in 2011, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. We recently negotiated a 5-year extension to our bank revolver, which now has $1.75 billion of total capacity and doesn't mature until 2016. We repurchased over 18 million shares for over $675 million through the second quarter. We expect to remain aggressive, given our recent stock price and substantial investment capacity. 
Now to provide more details about the vacation ownership business and the pending transaction, I'd like to turn things over to Steve Weisz. Steve?"

As we prepare to be an independent company, we've put a lot of thought into our future strategy. In our view, no one does vacation ownership better. We market our products by leveraging the strongest lodging brands and a world-class sales force. We execute against high customer expectations with outstanding products and services that encourages customers to buy yet more product.  And as a result, our more than 400,000 customers are very loyal and highly satisfied. 
We believe an independent Marriott Vacations worldwide will be attractive to shareholders for several reasons. First, we will be the largest public pure-play vacation ownership business. We have a highly skilled management team with an outstanding track record focused on this attractive business and an early stage of a recovery. 
Second, we see upside in the business. We are still in the early stages of the rollout of our Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Program. We continue to sign up existing owners, and our average contract sale continues to increase. So there is still considerable upside as the program continues to gain traction with new owners. 
Third, we have strong liquidity and modest non-securitized debt. We recently demonstrated our resiliency in the deepest recessions with good cost control and strong cash flow and feel that we are well positioned to thrive regardless of the economic climate. 
Fourth, while we recognize the vacation ownership has historically been a capital-intensive business, our cash needs in the near term are quite modest. We have $1.3 billion of inventory, including $600 million of finished goods inventory. This will minimize our capital needs for the next few years. 
We also believe we can generate cash flow over time from the sale of excess assets, including some very attractive beachfront real estate. In fact, we expect to generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow for the foreseeable future. As our inventory declines over time, we intend to pursue asset-light expansion opportunities. We expect to leverage our management know-how to manage Timeshare operations for other brands and/or develop ancillary businesses to drive high margin recurring and stable revenues. We also expect to be able to develop new resorts by distressed inventory or enter into turnkey projects with third-party developers. Ours will be a resourceful and nimble company. It will quickly seize opportunities presented to us. 
We know there are many questions about the appropriate valuation for this new company. We're working on pro forma numbers for our new Timeshare company and expect to have forecasts available when we do our roadshow this fall. For valuation, we recommend a ""sum of the parts"" approach given that we expect to have a material portion of our cash flow coming from strong and sustainable management fees and net financing income, as well as our development business. 
We look forward to meeting with as many of you as possible early this fall. With that, I'll turn things back to Arne."

Obviously, we'd have to see how Q4 gets developed, and we're giving you our best sense at this point, but there's no guarantees on this.

But I think the guidance we're giving you is essentially constant dollar guidance.  And so by and large, we're not trying to get into the currency forecasting business and give you currency-adjusted REVPAR numbers. With respect to the Middle East and D.C. -- Middle East, Japan and D.C., let's start with D.C., which is more material to us than the Middle East and Japan are. D.C., as we mentioned a quarter ago, our distribution in D.C. is a bit over 2x the industry's distribution in D.C., so it moves a bit larger for our average statistics. We have been a bit disappointed so far the balance of the year to see D.C. essentially perform at flat to last year. Carl mentioned the good news in D.C., which is that it's one of the markets which is about at peak REVPAR, and not surprisingly that's because the business of government and security and national defense and all that has been a relatively robust part of our economy for the last number of years and was not hit nearly as bad in the recession as many other aspects of the U.S. economy. I think now we would say that we expect D.C. to continue to bump along at kind of flat levels through the balance of the year, and that's implicit in our guidance. We have not really talked about 2012 yet, and we don't have any budgets or anything else that gives us tremendous insight into 2012. So without the benefit of a careful look at group business on the books and some of those things, it's hard to give you a real clear number, but I would guess that the budget conversations and threats to the federal budget, as well as the presidential election which will increasingly take center stage next year, neither of those are great fins for business in D.C. for 2012. And so we would guess that D.C. is going to continue to be a fairly modest market, at least in terms of year-over-year performance. Middle East and Japan are obviously very different markets. Japan is -- got the leading hotel from a REVPAR perspective in Tokyo, which is the Ritz-Carlton. And it has suffered as many hotels in Japan have, both because of less inbound travel by the intercontinental traveler, and beyond that by a sense of reduced economic activity and maybe a even a little sense of mourning in Japan. We're starting to see some of those trends reverse. So the F&B business, for example, essentially disappeared early after the earthquake and tsunami. We're starting to see some signs of life in that and see that come back. We're seeing occupancy build. But we expect that even in the fourth quarter, we will be -- oh, I suspect on average 20% to 30% REVPAR down from the fourth quarter of 2010. Now that's a lot better than where we've been since the early months of the post-disaster over there, but still a long way from where it was before. Middle East, very different markets. I think Egypt -- I was there a few weeks ago. Got to see our team and get a sense for what's going on in the ground there. Egypt is a fabulous destination and there's every reason to believe that it will come back. Many markets in D.C., though, are -- excuse me, in Egypt are driven by wholesalers often coming out of Europe. That wholesale business is not likely to come back with significance until there has been sustained stability in that market. We haven't seen that yet, and so we would both expect in the guidance that we've given and as a predictive matter that Egypt is probably a 12- to 18-month recovery story. It's not a 3- to 6-month recovery story. Other markets in the Middle East are very different. So you look at Dubai. Dubai has net benefited in some respects from this. Bahrain is obviously quite weak. We're not in Syria, but we are in Jordan. Jordan is not as bad as Egypt and in many respects is more stable. But generally, I think implicit in our guidance is a pretty slow recovery for the region as a whole."

And longer refers only to in comparison to REVPAR. So when you look at the REVPAR numbers, and we've talked about D.C. a little bit in this call, obviously D.C. is roughly at peak REVPAR already. You look at the U.S. as a whole, and clearly the U.S. as a whole is not back to peak REVPAR, but we can see it.  And it's not far out. So a year or 18 months or 2 years, probably worse case from now, we're looking at most markets in the United States being to peak REVPAR. But that's not enough to get us back to peak profitability, either for hotel owners or for Marriott.  And obviously, our models differ a little bit. We're going to be fee-driven. They're going to be driven by the profit margins in those hotels.  And that's what's going to take a little bit longer. I don't have a date for you on that, but we would have a reasonably high level of confidence, as we would have in prior cycles that within a couple of years or so after peak REVPAR, we should be approaching in many markets peak profitability.  And we look forward to seeing how that works its way through. And obviously, in the context of that, I also talked about the tremendous unit growth, which will also be adding certainly to our system and our profitability as we go forward."

If anything, we've been very heartened by the strength of leisure business. Now let's back up and state the obvious. Leisure travel is more price-sensitive than business travel, surprise, surprise. Notwithstanding that, I think most of the leisure business which is driven in our hotels is probably coming out of the higher wealth demographic as a consequence that a persistent high unemployment, the weakness in the construction trades and the like is probably less relevant currently than what we're seeing in leisure demand. But leisure demand is going to be more influenced by pricing and by consumer sentiment and those sorts of things. And as a consequence we see it be a little bit weaker, but still pretty healthy on a year-over-year basis and are quite gratified by what we've seen so far. I think all things considered, what we're communicating today is a ""steady as she goes"" report. What we see is a broad recovery that's underway. It is playing out in many respects the way exactly we would expect it to play out. So business transient travel is the strongest, showing great performance year-over-year, both in terms of pricing and in terms of volume. We're seeing group bookings build steadily. And Carl gave you some of the statistics. We're up -- bookings in Q2 were up anywhere from up roughly 15% to roughly 20%, depending on whether you're looking at bookings for Q3 or Q4 in 2012 or 2013, et cetera. Good healthy year-over-year growth and good leisure performance.  And so we mean very much to be reiterating the high single-digit 6% to 8% REVPAR growth that we've talked about a quarter ago. And we'd really not add any caution with the exception of the stories we've talked about in Middle East, Japan and D.C. And to state the obvious, we are reading the same newspapers that you all are reading. And if some of these newspapers lead to slower GDP growth than any of us anticipated, that will have an impact ultimately on business travel and the rest of it. But we're not seeing that show up in our business today."

But when we look at the Q2 stayed and paid, and that's what that roughly 2% growth is looking at again, it's not looking at bookings in Q2, but it's looking at the business that came out of the books, it shouldn't surprise you to know that the weakest business was the business that was booked 2 and 3 years ago. So when we look at business booked 2 years ago, stayed in our second quarter, it was down almost 10%. It shouldn't surprise you because 2 years ago, we were really wrestling with fairly dark days in the economy. Three years ago wasn't quite as bad even though actually if you look at the stock market, the stock market was probably worse 3 years ago than it was 2 years ago. And that's probably a little bit that folks making decisions about group business are not responding necessarily to what they see on the Dow that day, but a little bit it takes some time for them to react. And so when we look instead at business booked more recently, it is meaningfully better than those weak numbers. But again fundamentally, and this is in the prepared comments we talked about it a quarter ago, it takes a while to build the book of group business. And as a consequence, we're not surprised to see the stayed and paid REVPAR group numbers in Q2 lower than the transient numbers. And we would expect that those will build over time as we get the benefit of that plus 15% to 20% group revenue booked in Q2 as it ultimately shows up in our hotels."

I think where you're not going to see the deferred revenue anymore is around percentage complete. We're putting completed inventory in. So in the past, we would have deferred revenue as we completed projects that would come in. So that's the piece that virtually is gone. From a timing perspective, quarter-to-quarter, there is still some deferred revenue and it really relates primarily to our finance sales where you're required to have 10% down. And for GAAP reporting, you also need to cover your first aid benefits or some sales incentives that we give to customers at the closing table. In the second quarter, for example, we ran some sales incentives and offered some higher first aid benefits.  And as a result, we didn't have that 10% down for GAAP. So some of those sales, even though our sales for the second quarter, at least for Timeshare, were flat year-over-year. Our deferred revenue was slightly higher for the quarter because of some of that. And we'll see that flip around here in the third and fourth quarter.

And the short answer is we're not losing share to our competitors. So when you look at the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, and we'll focus -- I'll focus my comments on that brand, which is obviously substantial for us and the bellwether brand for us. We build our REVPAR index by hotel, with each hotel looking at typically 5 or 6 hotels which would be within its competitive set. Overwhelmingly, those hotels are in the same market. Occasionally, you'll find a resort hotel which might have a hotel that's outside of it, same geographic market. But 98%, I suppose, of the MHR hotels, their competitive sets will be entirely located within the same geography. Every period or every month we report, as do most of our competitors in the United States, this is less the case outside the United States, to Smith Travel. And Smith Travel spits back the result of all of that data and tells us whether we are taking or losing share. Since the recession began in late 2007 or early 2008, the Marriott brand has taken about 4 points of index, which is massive. Why did it take index? Well, hopefully, a part of it is because of great things we've been doing around customer-focused things, around product-focused things, around brand innovation, about renovations and the like. But clearly, we were also helped by the cyclicality of group business where we had group business on the books more than our competitors did because we're bigger shops and benefited from some of those bookings that were done before the recession hit.  And as a consequence, our REVPAR did not decline as much as the average Smith Travel did. Now as we look at 2011 year-to-date and we adjust for renovations, we see that the MHR brand is down a few tenths of one percentage point. We think that, that is actually pretty encouraging because of this cyclicality in group business that we know to occur at this state of the recovery. In many respects, we would expect to be losing share that could be measurable and at a few tenths of 1 point, there's no volatility in these numbers. It's effectively nearly 0. And so as we sit here today, we have tremendous confidence not only that we have taken massive share over the last 3 or 4 years, but that we are competing very well.  And what's driving the difference in these headline numbers is, by and large, a function of geographic distribution of these hotels and not a function of any share index performance."

Marriott brand is bigger than most of the full-service brands, so we're going to tend to have more suburban hotels. We're probably going tend to have more secondary market hotels. I know among our markets where we have disproportionate market share, we've got Detroit, we've got Atlanta, we've got Washington, D.C. And you'd have to go and look at the data to see about how those markets perform exactly and how they perform in the first couple of quarters this year. The suburban piece though, I think, is going to be significant. So a quarter ago, we've talked about D.C. hotels, and I think one of our competitors came out and said, ""Well, we own a hotel in D.C. and it didn't do so badly."" Well, we've got 100 hotels in D.C. And the JW Marriott Downtown at 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue owned by Host, great hotel. I don't have the performance of every hotel right here in front of me, but the Downtown hotel in Washington which is trading at a higher end performed better in the second quarter than the average across the market. Because when you look at Crystal City, which is going to be dominated by government business, it's going to have big competing hotels in Crystal City, and that's going to be a much more hard hit area than the JW Marriott hotel or the Ritz-Carlton on the west side of Washington, D.C. And unless you look at this competitive set data, the REVPAR index data, you're not getting anything meaningful by looking at the performance of MHR against Smith Travel's upper upscale, because you're going to be comparing apples and oranges."

Let me try to answer your question. First of all, on the contract sales side, if you look at our Timeshare, let's leave the fractional and the whole ownership residential piece out, in the second quarter, we did exactly what we did in 2010. So the deferred piece that John referred to is not the fact that we had sales in the second quarter that won't be reportable until the first quarter of 2012, it's the fact that the second quarter sales might be reportable in Q3 or Q4. But if you continue doing the kinds of promotions which we believe we will be doing at least in the near term, that some of the sales that will happen in Q3 or Q4 will spill over into Q1 of next year. So it's just kind of the cascading effect of that. And so I think that's the first answer to your question. The second answer to your question is 39% of our sales year-to-date are to first-time buyers, which implies that 61% are obviously to our existing customers. That's been very deliberate on our part. We have -- we made it a focus. We made it a strategic decision that when we launched the points business in June of 2010, that we really wanted to get in front of every single one of our existing owners to try to help them understand the relative merits of them joining Marriott Vacation Club Destinations. So as we have allocated tour flow and trying to, in fact, take advantage of talking to people while they're on vacation at our resorts, we have squeezed out tours to first-time buyers, that was very deliberate. And we said we would do that. As we start to move further into this year, now having a year behind us, we will have talked to a lot of those customers. We would expect that over time that we will start to see the percentage of first-time buyers come back to a more normalized percentage. You may recall that roughly 50% of our business over the years has been to first-time buyers and roughly 50% of our business has been to existing owners and their referrals. So I think it's -- what we've seen is playing out exactly what we wanted to do.

But I think one of the other things that as a response to your question, Steve Kent, is that a year ago and 1.5 year ago, Steve Weisz and his team were doing more with peer discounting of the pricing of the Timeshare mix. We've not only eliminated that discounting, but in many respects pound for pound, we have increased pricing.  And there is some promotional activity, which is a way of addressing a piece of that to make sure that we've still got a value proposition and a pitch for the customer that is an attractive one.  And we think that the decisions they've made in that space are good. You are not hearing Steve Weisz say or any of us say that consumer confidence is back to a level which gives us the confidence to believe that we can sell as much weekly Timeshare as we were selling in 2006 and 2007. And to get back to those levels is going to require a continuing recovery in the economy and a continuing recovery in consumer confidence. And as those things happen, we'll see that this business continues to grow. But none of us are sitting here saying we feel so good about this product that we don't have to do promotional activity and we can sort of sit back and play hard to get and the customer's going to come in and buy more of this stuff than we can produce, because that's not where we are yet in this economic recovery.

Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, October 6, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriot.com/investor.
For the third quarter, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29, a 32% increase from our prior year. On an adjusted basis, we were at the upper end of our $0.25 to $0.29 July guidance. Our adjusted operating income was also at the upper end of our guidance, excluding spinoff transaction costs. Timeshare sales and services net was about $0.01 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. On the plus side, stronger-than-expected REVPAR increased results in our leased hotels, particularly in London and Tokyo, which give us about a penny upside. We also picked up about $0.01 each from termination fees, tax rate and share count. 
North American transient demand remained very strong in the third quarter. Systemwide North American REVPAR rose 7%, at the high end of our expectation, with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. 
In the greater Washington D.C. market, systemwide REVPAR declined 2%. Demand continues to be constrained by the shortened congressional calendar, ongoing budget battles, weak government group demand, and in this quarter, Hurricane Irene. Fortunately, better group bookings in D.C. and an increase in the government per diem should help the fourth quarter. 
North American systemwide Courtyard REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. We are seeing meaningful impact from the Courtyard refreshing business lobby renovations. Over 370 hotels have been renovated today, with another 77 properties planned for 2012. We expect to have substantially all our Courtyard properties offering the new product by year end 2013. 
Ritz-Carlton had a terrific third quarter. North American Ritz-Carlton REVPAR rose nearly 14%. Sales at club level and suites are up, and worldwide luxury incentive fees almost doubled in the quarter. We launched Ritz-Carlton Rewards last year, and we've already signed up more than 150,000 members. Today, Ritz-Carlton's worldwide hotel development pipeline stands at nearly 6,000 rooms, largely in international markets. These rooms represent a more than 40% decrease on the existing Ritz-Carlton International room base. 
Company-operated REVPAR for the domestic Marriott brand increased 4% in the quarter, with group business up 2%. Catering sales also rose 2% in the quarter. Group business was impacted by weak government group demand in D.C. and the slow return of association group business. 
Our sales executives continue to do a great job. For 2012, total revenue bookings for the Marriott brand are running up 7% year-over-year compared to only 3% pace in February. Bookings made in the third quarter for 2 years out, in this case 2013, are up 31% year-over-year. One of the key benefit of our new sales organization in the U.S. is the pitching and catching of meeting prospects between regions. This is possible because we now have the systems, the training and the incentives for sales executives to sell our system rather than a single hotel. For group business booked in the first 3 quarters of 2011, nearly 900,000 room by obtained by sales executives selling business going to hotels outside their regions, which represented roughly 7% of all group revenue booked. We believe this is largely incremental business that is significantly ahead of our expectations. 
The new sales organization is also doing well when we examine more intangible measures. Our customer response time, sales quality and follow-up performance are closely monitored and continue to improve. In fact, Marriott sales response time is industry-leading in the third quarter according to a third-party survey. 
Our customers are delighted. In mid-August, we surveyed 4,500 industry group meeting planners. 2/3 said that no other lodging company is easier to do business with than Marriott and 80% said they are more likely to do business with Marriott brand in 2012 than in 2011. 
Our U.S. sales organization is calling on 7x more U.S. accounts than in the past. With our unique organization structure, we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of business from key international markets such as China, India and Europe. While we continue to the organization, we are gratified by these excellent results. 
We just signed a global distribution agreement with bookings.com, the largest online travel agency in Europe, which is expanding its presence within the U.S. market. In contrast to the merchant model, the booking.com commission model arranges for a benefiting hotel to pay a commission after the stay. While OTAs will continue to represent a very small portion of our overall business, we expect this agreement will improve our efficiency and revenue over time. 
Incidentally, we are also negotiating our Expedia contract, which is scheduled for renewal later this year. 
Performance outside North America was unprecedented. Comparable systemwide REVPAR was strong throughout Asia, rising 9% on a constant dollar basis and 17% reflecting actual exchange rates. Comparable REVPAR in Europe increased 6% on a constant dollar basis and 18% including currency, with particular strength in London and Paris. 
Middle East remains a challenging market but REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased 12%. Finally, REVPAR in Japan is bouncing back ahead of expectations. Local Japanese demand is strengthening, and Japanese travel to Korea has resumed. Our profit margin in the third quarter for domestic company-operated properties increased 130 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy, improved room rates and good cost control. House profit margin for international hotels increased 40 basis points constrained by weak REVPAR in the Middle East. 
Worldwide base and franchise fee revenue rose 12% in the third quarter, and incentive fees were up 38% in the seasonally slow period. Incentive fees were particularly strong in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. 
Our owned and leased properties increased dramatically year-over-year, in part due to $8 million in higher termination fees, $13 million improvement -- $13 million improvement in branding fees from our credit card and residential sales and $7 million from stronger results at our leased hotels, particularly in Anaheim and London. 
For our Timeshare business, third quarter contract sales were ahead of expectations due to stronger sales at a joint venture project, while North America Vacation Ownership sales were right in line. Timeshare sales and services net was lower than we expected, largely due to lower revenue reportability, some ADA compliance costs and costs associated with Hurricane Irene in the Bahamas. 
Adjusted general and administrative expenses rose 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff transaction, higher costs associated with our international expansion and higher incentive compensation. Workout costs were a bit lower than expected, largely due to timing. Adjusting out the $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff, G&A came in at $162 million, a bit better than the $165 million to $170 million guidance. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the third quarter pace. Many of our newer comparable hotels in Asia have benefited from ramp up in recent quarters, and the fourth quarter will reflect tougher comps. REVPAR in Europe will likely moderate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany, as well as tougher comparables. REVPAR in London is expected to remain strong, but we anticipate weak performance in the British provinces as a result of government austerity efforts. 
So for the fourth quarter, we are assuming international systemwide REVPAR growth to increase 3% to 5% on a constant dollar basis or 5% to 7% excluding the Middle East and Japan. 
In North America, we expect systemwide REVPAR growth of 6% to 8%. Across North America, we see little evidence of economic slowdown in our Lodging business. Group cancellations and attrition levels are running at normal levels. In fact, group attendance is running a bit higher and meeting the expectations in many hotels. 
For our Timeshare business, our guidance assumes the business will spin off at Marriott at year end 2011. On this basis, we expect fourth quarter contract sales to total $200 million to $210 million, and Timeshare sales and services net to total $68 million to $73 million. Similarly, we would expect Timeshare segment results would total $45 million to $50 million, reflecting continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. This places full year 2011 Adjusted Timeshare segment results at $131 million to $136 million. These full year segment results are roughly $10 million below our product guidance, largely due to deferred revenue reportability and the timing impact of the banking and borrowing option under our points-based program. As we mentioned last quarter, more owners are choosing to bank their points for more expensive vacations in 2012. 
On this basis, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.45 or $0.50 per share, a 15% to 28% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. For the full year 2011, we expect adjusted EPS will increase 19% to 23% to $1.37 to $1.42. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA will climb 7% to 8% compared to last year's adjusted amount. Our guidance assumes the spinoff will not occur until year end 2011, and again, includes the $13 million we spent on year-to-date spinoff costs but excludes future spinoff costs. 
On a cash basis, we estimate the total cash transaction costs related to the spin at $40 million to $50 million for the full year 2011. We have already expensed about $13 million of this through the income statement year-to-date. Not all of the $40 million to $50 million will be expensed in 2011 as some will be capitalized. 
While our guidance assumes Timeshare will remain with Marriott through the fourth quarter, it is actually more likely the business will spin off prior to year end 2011. An updated Form 10 was filed last week. Commitments on the new revolver have been obtained, and the agreement is on track to be executed this month. 
S&P has rated MVW Credit at BB-. In coming days, we expect to receive an IRS private letter ruling confirming that the distribution of MVW shares will be tax-free to Marriott and its shareholders. MVW's new receivables warehouse facility has closed and funded. The MVW team will hold their first Analyst Meeting at the New York Marriott Marquis on October 28, 2011. Invitations will go out soon. Management looks forward to meeting with you and discussing their prospects, including their outlook for 2012. 
They expect the conduct a roadshow with Deutsche Bank in November, and we still need to finish some intercompany agreements, complete the Form 10 and receive final board approval. We expect to complete this necessary work and present the transaction to our board by the end of October, distributing shares to shareholders around the end of November. 
With this transaction, Marriott expects to receive approximately $325 million to $350 million in cash tax benefits through 2015, including $70 million to $80 million in cash tax benefits in 2011 and $120 million to $130 million in 2012. 
Through the third quarter, we've already realized roughly $55 million in cash tax benefits. To be clear, this transaction does not materially change our booked tax rate. These are only cash tax benefits equivalent to about $1 per share in value. 
While we aren't completing our typical notes securitization this year, we've already received most of the $110 million we expect under the MVW warehouse facility. Combined with the roughly $40 million in proceeds from the sale of preferred stock of MVW's U.S. holding company, Marriott International should receive approximately $150 million in a cash distribution in the fourth quarter prior to completion of the transaction. This will have no impact on Marriott's earnings. 
With regard to earnings, we estimate the Timeshare business net of the transaction costs will contribute roughly $0.10 to $0.11 to our estimated full year 2011 EPS. The calculation is on Page A-18 in the earnings release we put out last night. 
Once the spinoff is complete, Marriott International will not account for the Timeshare business as a discontinued operation. We expect to provide detailed and more precise pro forma income statements for the new Marriott for 2010 and 2011 shortly after the spinoff. 
By the way, we expect Marriott Vacations Worldwide will file their own 10-Q for the third quarter as a stand-alone company once this spin is complete. 
For 2011, we assume $500 million to $600 million in Marriott investment spending, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance pending. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 36 million shares for over $1.2 billion through the end of the quarter, and given our current debt levels, we expect to slow our repurchase pace in the fourth quarter. 
Now to provide more details about Marriott International's 2012 outlook, I'd like to turn things over to Arne Sorenson. Arne?"

As Carl mentioned, we are not seeing weakening demand in our business as",1297,"Thanks, Carl. This the a time of year where we typically provide our initial view of the upcoming year. The question of greatest interest is what should we model for REVPAR in 2012? As Carl mentioned, we are not seeing weakening demand in our business as we speak. At the same time, we read the same newspapers you do and we can't ignore the risks. 
As you know, all other things being equal, weaker economic growth results in weaker lodging demand. So today, we are presenting a broad range of REVPAR growth assumptions. 3% REVPAR growth correlates with modest GDP growth, perhaps 1% or so and it's hopefully too conservative. 7% REVPAR growth correlates to 2.5% to 3% GDP growth and is probably too aggressive to count on. But we present these bookends to allow investors to independently model the business as we all have different views of the future. 
We further estimate that a one-point change in worldwide REVPAR in 2012 should equate to roughly $80 million pretax of full year fees plus about $5 million pretax of owned and leased profits. These are only rules, of course. Interestingly, even with no GDP growth, we would still expect some modest REVPAR growth in North America. This is largely because of the very favorable supply environment. According to Smith Travel, supply growth is expected to increase a mere 0.5% in 2012, on top of only a 0.7% growth in 2011. Given the supply environment, we believe it is very unlikely we'll see North American REVPAR decline in the absence of a pronounced downturn in the economy. 
In fact, in a recent report, Raymond James noted that since January 1988, the earliest data they've looked at, there has not been a single month of negative REVPAR when supply growth has been less than 1%. 
Now whilst the supply growth is modest, our unit growth continues. 12 months ago, we had a 95,000-room pipeline. Since then, 33,000 rooms have opened into our system, and the pipeline has risen to 105,000 rooms. Measured by newly-signed rooms, 2011 will be one of our largest development years ever. Our pipeline continues to build and is becoming increasingly international. 10 years ago, our international development pipeline totaled 14,000 rooms. Today, we have over 47,000 rooms in our development pipeline outside the U.S. 
In Asia, today, we have roughly 100 hotels in our pipeline compared to only 60 12 months ago. With just the completion of these hotels, we'll have over 230 hotels in our Asia Pacific region. 
We're very bullish about the long-term opportunities in the Middle East and Africa too. As you saw in Monday, we named a new President and Managing Director of our Middle East and Africa division, Alex is currently head of Deloitte's Travel Tourism and Lodging business in Dubai and London. Alex brings a wealth of context and insights into the region and will join us on the first of the year. We are excited about the addition of Alex to our team, although we will miss Ed Fuller who is retiring after 40 years at Marriott, including over 20 years running our international operations. 
In the U.S., ground-up development is very challenging today. In the last 12 months, Smith Travel reports that only 47,000 rooms were added to the U.S. industry supply. In this same time period, Marriott opened roughly 3,000 conversion rooms and 12,000 newly-constructed rooms, representing 1/4 of all new hotel supply growth in the U.S. Only strong brands are getting new development deals done in the U.S. today. 
Our Autograph brand continues to show strong results and considerable franchise interest. While not included in comparable hotel statistics, REVPAR for our first 14 converted Autograph Hotels rose 12% for the 3 months ended in August, with REVPAR index up over 5%. With 24 hotels worldwide today, we expect roughly 40 properties opened or signed by year end 2011 and 60 to 70 properties by year end 2012. Autograph is off to a sunny start. 
We remain very bullish both about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry and near-term prospects for Marriott. With strong demand and low supply growth, a return to peak 2007 REVPAR is on the horizon. More importantly, our return to peak fee revenue from Marriott is very near. Our model implies the revenue in 2012 of $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion, which is quite comparable to our fee revenue performance in 2007. Our base and franchise fees hold up well because they are much less susceptible to the economy and they benefit from unit growth. 
Since the third quarter of 2007, our rooms have increased from over 525,000 rooms to nearly 640,000 rooms. We expect to open roughly 5,000 rooms in the fourth quarter of this year, 30,000 rooms for the full year of 2011 and another 30,000 rooms in 2012. 
We expect to achieve growth in rooms with modest net invested capital. We also expect to generate meaningful amounts of some free cash flow. In the past 4 years, we have reduced fully diluted shares outstanding by nearly 10% as we applied excess cash flow to repurchase 62 million shares. In 2012, we expect to have another $500 million to $1 billion of cash available for share repurchase for opportunistic investing. 
In fact, even if we only see a 3% REVPAR growth, we will expect some level of share repurchase activity in 2012. 
While we announced the Timeshare spinoff in February, we now analyst models included in consensus for 2012 largely do not account for that transaction. So while we've provided a 2012 model today, we've also provided an estimate of 2011 Timeshare impact for comparability. 
Our prior peak earnings occurred in 2007. Adjusting the entire 2007 income statement for the Timeshare spinoff, our EPS in 2007 would've totaled about $1.51 per share. Assuming REVPAR rose 3% to 7% year-over-year in 2012 and further assuming we complete our spinoff by year end 2011, diluted EPS for 2012 for Marriott International, excluding Timeshare, could total $1.48 to $1.68. This means we should exceed 2007 EPS levels even if we see a modest REVPAR growth environment. 
Our outlook is also substantially ahead of our modeled 2011 adjusted full year earnings of $1.27 to $1.31, which excludes Timeshare and the Timeshare transaction costs. While there's a great deal of uncertainty around the economy, there is much we do know. Group revenue on the books is up 7% for 2012, and U.S. government per diems are up 4% to 7%, depending on the market. We'll have to see how special negotiated corporate rates turn out, but our strong book of group business gives us some negotiating leverage. 
In the August customer survey that Carl mentioned earlier, we also asked meeting planners about their plans for 2012. 2/3 of respondents indicated that their organization will have the same or greater lodging spend next year. As importantly, we see no sign of resurgence in supply growth in the U.S. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the third quarter, and Marriott International has adjusted pretax margin excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased from 17% in the 2010 third quarter to nearly 19% in the 2011 quarter. We are excited about the near-term launch of Marriott Vacations Worldwide as the leading pure-play Timeshare company in the world with the finest brands that will have tremendous opportunity for growth going forward. 
We are excited about being a focused hotel management and franchise company, and we are excited about our continued unit growth and the substantial worldwide growth opportunities for our brands. We're pleased to take your questions at this time. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that we may include as many of you as possible. Melissa?"

This is for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts managed comp hotels is up 7% in revenue compared to the same time last year. And that reflects really continued strong bookings. We thought it was very interesting that in period 9, which is largely the matter month of August for us, group bookings that were made for the next 12 months were up 14% for the same period last year. As we all know, August was the month where probably the anxiety in the marketplace turned most intense.  And so we're quite comforted by that activity.  And even as we closed that period 9 and closed our third quarter, when we look at the bookings that we're working on that have not yet been made, so we're really talking about the funnel there, the funnel was up over say 17% from the same period last year. So all of that gives us at least the basis to say that there's no sign of the weakness have shown up yet. And the way the companies are acting today, they still seem to be prepared to make commitments for their business going forward. Carl had some statistics about transformation and the pitching and catching with, we'll do $150 million to $200 million this year easily in business that is pitched from one sales office to a very different market across the country. That's the kind of activity that's made possible by the sales transformation program that we've got. We obviously have just completed in roughly July 1 the rollout of this program to all of the markets in the United States. There's nothing dramatic that we can report to you other than we feel like we're continuing to make progress.

So Europe, Carl's comments talked about the U.K. provinces, which I think is the one meaningful market for us where we've seen some slowdown, and we think that's by and large driven by the U.K. government belt-tightening. We have only one hotel in Greece, and so that hotel in Athens is not very material to our results and to tell you the truth, I can't tell you exactly what's happening in Greece in terms of demand trends in that market. But when we look across the rest of Europe, we actually see a surprisingly strong performance, notwithstanding the incredible newspaper stories we seem to read everyday in the rounds of crisis that we've got really coming out of the Greece and Spain and Italy at this point. I think we'll continue to watch Europe carefully as we go forward. I think implicit in the numbers we've got within that 3% to 7% range next year is relatively more modest growth in Europe than in other parts of the world. And I think a bit of that is their fare schedule which is relevant, a bit more relevant to the way their -- our business reports there than maybe is in other parts of the world. I think part of that is just a bit more modest expectations for those economies generally. China and Asia continue to move spectacularly well. Obviously, they're looking at a residential bubble particularly in the property space and trying to discern whether they have one, and if they do, what to do with it. If by and large it's not impacting the pace by which we're taking new hotels into our pipeline in China. The hotels there in our pipeline of 105,000 rooms are 90% under construction in China, some number like that and will represent the bulk of what we open into mid-2012. It is the case though that often resign as with contracts for our customers have been put under construction before we sign that contract. And we are working on dozens of hotels in China alone that we're still optimistic we'll be able to sign here over the next few quarters. So at this point, it's all systems go for us. And I think one of the really positive things about China is notwithstanding the difficulty of the World Expo comparisons, which started to hit in Q3, the demand trends in China and much of the rest of Asia are surprising to the upside and don't show any signs of losing momentum."

We have obviously been really active in the market year-to-date, with about 36 million shares purchased.

In the quarter, for the quarter, you only get, for a certain amount of it, on a year-to-date basis, you don't really get that much impact. So the EPS numbers are really not driven for 2012 by share repurchase activity that has not been done today. Our model tends to assume that we're going to buy stock at valuations which would be significantly above where the market values today and in part because of that, because you don't get the full year benefit of that, there really isn't much EPS contribution from future purchases."

But what's happening under that grand total is a dramatic increase in the stability of that fee bucket. So if you look back at 2007, I'll have to go check the records to be sure, but I think it was like $369 million of incentive fees, which were majority in the United States, which obviously have a risk profile which is different from incentive fees outside the United States, and incentive fees have a risk profile which is natively different from base and franchise fees. When I look at 2007, we'll see total fees by the company much higher, not much higher, excuse me, but roughly the same level as 2007. We'll see the total incentive fee bucket lower in nominal dollars, therefore you've got more stability in the base and franchise fees.  And a much higher portion of the incentive fees that we do have being internationally driven, which are also lower risk. I think you can come up with some assumptions here which shouldn't put you too far off if you look at base -- rooms revenue growth and unit growth. You can make some assumptions about what's happening in the incentive fee line based on those 3% to 7% scenarios."

But I think among all of the things that had been interesting, I had look made at September occupancies. I think basically, what we're seeing is that for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand as an example, September occupancies in 2011 were essentially exactly the same as September occupancies in 2007. That's domestic, yes, not global. And I think you can see when you look at Smith Travel data and some of the other data which is out there in the marketplace, in many recent months, the U.S. lodging industry has seen record demand. What do we mean by that? We mean that our customers, for the industry as a whole, are buying more total rooms than they purchased in 2007. And I think that occupancy is one of the positive attributes of this round of negotiations with our special corporate accounts. Obviously, pricing will vary a little bit by market to market. Where occupancy is higher, we'll have a bit more leverage. To some extent, that will allow us to drive rates within the accounts, and at the same time beyond that, it will allow us to yield some accounts where we're bringing in higher rate and special corporate accounts and probably, in effect, yielding away some special corporate accounts which are not quite as strong. In terms of dynamic pricing, I think generally, that is not material for us. I wouldn't pretend to be an expert in that. There are a number of different tools obviously that are used in special corporate negotiations, that include such powerful things as last room availability and to what extent that's being provided to accounts. And that's probably a bigger factor in what we're doing now than dynamic pricings."

So I think it would just take a little while for those incentive fees to come back into the money. In addition, some of the bases were adjusted as a result of the Courtyard refreshing businesses, and therefore, the priority would be increased as a result of that. But probably, the bigger effect is the fact that they're pooled in large groups of them. So that's why as you look at the number of hotels paying incentive fees, you have to kind of adjust for these big pools because one portfolio can start paying and that could represent 25, 50 hotels or more."

And so when that happens, we'll, of course, issue a press release. I think as we go forward, Carl's talked about this, we will be mindful of the risks that we sent out there. But generally, we'll use the capacity that we have either to invest in our business or if we haven't done that, to return it to our shareholders. And I suspect we'll see that continue. Our expectation will be we will not buy as much in the fourth quarter as we bought in the third quarter. A bit of that is because we're a little bit more levered now at the end of the third quarter than we were at the end of the second quarter. But we'll continue to watch it several times, and we think even at GDP levels, which are roughly flat in the United States, we could be posting positive REVPAR growth and positive cash flow and enough cash flow that probably, we'll have the ability to do some share repurchase even in that environment."

          Thanks, Melissa. Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, October 6, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
On the third quarter, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29, a 32% increase from our prior year. On an adjusted basis, we were at the upper end of our $0.25 to $0.29 July guidance. Our adjusted operating income was also at the upper end of our guidance, excluding spinoff transaction costs. Timeshare sales and services net was at about $0.01 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. On the plus side, stronger-than-expected REVPAR increased results in our leased hotels, particularly in London and Tokyo, which gave us about $0.01 upside. We also picked up about $0.01 each from termination fees, tax rate and share count. 
North American transient demand remained very strong in the third quarter. Systemwide North American REVPAR rose 7%, at the high end of our expectation, with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. 
In the greater Washington D.C. market, systemwide REVPAR declined 2%. Demand continues to be constrained by the shortened congressional calendar, ongoing budget battles, weak government group demand and, in this quarter, Hurricane Irene. Fortunately, better group bookings in D.C. and an increase in the government per diem should help the fourth quarter. 
North American systemwide Courtyard REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. We are seeing meaningful impact from the Courtyard Refreshing Business lobby renovations. Over 370 hotels have been renovated today, with another 77 properties planned for 2012. We expect to have substantially all our Courtyard properties offering the new product by year-end 2013. 
Ritz-Carlton had a terrific third quarter. North American Ritz-Carlton REVPAR rose nearly 14%. Sales at club level and suites are up, and worldwide luxury incentive fees almost doubled in the quarter. We launched Ritz-Carlton Rewards last year, and we've already signed up more than 150,000 members. Today, Ritz-Carlton's worldwide hotel development pipeline stands at nearly 6,000 rooms, largely in international markets. These rooms represent a more than 40% increase on the existing Ritz-Carlton International room base. 
Company-operated REVPAR for the domestic Marriott brand increased 4% in the quarter, with group business up 2%. Catering sales also rose 2% in the quarter. Group business was impacted by weak government group demand in D.C. and the slow return of association group business. 
Our sales executives continue to do a great job. For 2012, total revenue bookings for the Marriott brand are running up 7% year-over-year compared to only 3% pace in February. Bookings made in the third quarter for 2 years out, in this case, 2013, are up 31% year-over-year. One of the key benefits of our new sales organization in the U.S. is the pitching and catching of meeting prospects between regions. This is possible because we now have the systems, the training and the incentives for sales executives to sell our system rather than a single hotel. For group business booked in the first 3 quarters of 2011, nearly 900,000 room nights were obtained by sales executives selling business going to hotels outside their regions, which represented roughly 7% of all group revenue booked. We believe this is largely incremental business that is significantly ahead of our expectations. 
The new sales organization is also doing well when we examine more intangible measures. Our customer response time, sales quality and follow-up performance are closely monitored and continue to improve. In fact, Marriott sales office response time is industry-leading in the third quarter according to a third-party survey.  Our customers are delighted. In mid-August, we surveyed 4,500 industry group meeting planners. 2/3 said that no other lodging company is easier to do business with than Marriott, and 80% said they are more likely to do business with Marriott brands in 2012 than in 2011. 
Our U.S. sales organization is calling on 7x more U.S. accounts than in the past. With our unique organization structure, we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of business from key international markets such as China, India and Europe. While we continue to tweak the organization, we are gratified by these excellent results. 
We just signed a global distribution agreement with bookings.com, the largest online travel agency in Europe, which is expanding its presence within the U.S. market. In contrast to the merchant model, the booking.com commissionable model arranges for a benefiting hotel to pay a commission after the stay. While OTAs will continue to represent a very small portion of our overall business, we expect this agreement will improve our efficiency and revenue over time.  Incidentally, we are also negotiating our Expedia contract, which is scheduled for renewal later this year. 
Performance outside North America was impressive. Comparable systemwide REVPAR was strong throughout Asia, rising 9% on a constant dollar basis and 17% reflecting actual exchange rates. Comparable REVPAR in Europe increased 6% on a constant dollar basis and 18% including currency, with particular strength in London and Paris.  The Middle East remains a challenging market, but REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased 12%. Finally, REVPAR in Japan is bouncing back ahead of expectations. Local Japanese demand is strengthening, and Japanese travel to Korea has resumed. Our profit margin in the third quarter for domestic company-operated properties increased 130 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy, improved room rates and good cost control. House profit margins for international hotels increased 40 basis points, constrained by weak REVPAR in the Middle East. 
Worldwide base and franchise fee revenue rose 12% in the third quarter, and incentive fees were up 38% in the seasonally slow period. Incentive fees were particularly strong in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. 
Our owned and leased profits increased dramatically year-over-year in part due to $8 million in higher termination fees, $13 million improvement in branding fees from our credit card and residential sales and $7 million from stronger results at our leased hotels, particularly in Anaheim and London. 
For our Timeshare business, third quarter contract sales were ahead of expectations due to stronger sales at a joint venture project, while North America vacation ownership sales were right in line. Timeshare sales and services net was lower than we expected largely due to lower revenue reportability, some ADA compliance costs and costs associated with Hurricane Irene in the Bahamas. 
Adjusted general and administrative expenses rose 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff transaction, higher costs associated with our international expansion and higher incentive compensation. Workout costs were a bit lower than expected largely due to timing. Adjusting out the $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff, G&A came in at $162 million, a bit better than the $165 million to $170 million guidance. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the third quarter pace. Many of our newer comparable hotels in Asia have benefited from ramp-up in recent quarters, and the fourth quarter will reflect tougher comps. REVPAR in Europe will likely moderate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany, as well as tougher comparables. REVPAR in London is expected to remain strong, but we anticipate weak performance in the British provinces as a result of government austerity efforts. 
So for the fourth quarter, we are assuming international systemwide REVPAR growth to increase 3% to 5% on a constant dollar basis or 5% to 7% excluding the Middle East and Japan. 
In North America, we expect systemwide REVPAR growth of 6% to 8%. Across North America, we see little evidence of economic slowdown in our lodging business. Group cancellations and attrition levels are running at normal levels. In fact, group attendance is running a bit higher and meeting plan or expectations at many hotels. 
For our Timeshare business, our guidance assumes the business will spin off at Marriott at year-end 2011. On this basis, we expect fourth quarter contract sales to total $200 million to $210 million, and Timeshare sales and services net to total $68 million to $73 million. Similarly, we would expect Timeshare segment results would total $45 million to $50 million, reflecting continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. This places full year 2011 adjusted Timeshare segment results at $131 million to $136 million. These full year segment results are roughly $10 million below our prior guidance largely due to deferred revenue reportability and the timing impact of the banking and borrowing option under our points-based program. As we mentioned last quarter, more owners are choosing to bank their points for a more expensive vacation in 2012. 
On this basis, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.45 to $0.50 per share, a 15% to 28% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. For the full year 2011, we expect adjusted EPS will increase 19% to 23% to $1.37 to $1.42. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA will climb 7% to 8% compared to last year's adjusted amount. Our guidance assumes the spinoff will not occur until year-end 2011 and, again, includes the $13 million pretax we spent on year-to-date spinoff costs but excludes future spinoff costs. 
On a cash basis, we estimate the total cash transaction costs related to the spin at $40 million to $50 million for the full year 2011. We have already expensed about $13 million of this through the income statement year-to-date. Not all of the $40 million to $50 million will be expensed in 2011 as some will be capitalized. 
While our guidance assumes Timeshare will remain with Marriott through the fourth quarter, it is actually more likely the business will spin off prior to year-end 2011. An updated Form 10 was filed last week. Commitments on the new revolver have been obtained, and the agreement is on track to be executed this month. 
S&P has rated MVW Credit at BB-. In coming days, we expect to receive an IRS private letter ruling confirming that the distribution of MVW shares will be tax-free to Marriott and its shareholders. MVW's new receivables warehouse facility has closed and funded. The MVW team will hold their first Analyst Meeting at the New York Marriott Marquis on October 28, 2011. Invitations will go out soon. Management looks forward to meeting with you and discussing their prospects, including their outlook for 2012. 
They expect to conduct a roadshow with Deutsche Bank in November, and we still need to finish some intercompany agreements, complete the Form 10 and receive final board approval. We expect to complete this necessary work and present the transaction to our board by the end of October, distributing shares to shareholders around the end of November. 
With this transaction, Marriott expects to receive approximately $325 million to $350 million in cash tax benefits through 2015, including $70 million to $80 million in cash tax benefits in 2011 and $120 million to $130 million in 2012. 
Through the third quarter, we've already realized roughly $55 million in cash tax benefits. To be clear, this transaction does not materially change our book tax rate. These are only cash tax benefits equivalent to about $1 per share in value. 
While we aren't completing our typical note securitization this year, we've already received most of the $110 million we expect under the MVW warehouse facility. Combined with the roughly $40 million in proceeds from the sale of preferred stock of MVW's U.S. holding company, Marriott International should receive approximately $150 million in a cash distribution in the fourth quarter prior to completion of the transaction. This will have no impact on Marriott's earnings. 
With regard to earnings, we estimate the Timeshare business, net of the transaction costs, will contribute roughly $0.10 to $0.11 to our estimated full year 2011 EPS. The calculation is on Page A-18 in the earnings release we put out last night. 
Once the spinoff is complete, Marriott International will not account for the Timeshare business as a discontinued operations. We expect to provide detailed and more precise pro forma income statements for the new Marriott for 2010 and 2011 shortly after the spinoff. 
By the way, we expect Marriott Vacations Worldwide will file their own 10-Q for the third quarter as a standalone company once the spin is complete. 
For 2011, we assume $500 million to $600 million in Marriott investment spending, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 36 million shares for over $1.2 billion through the end of the quarter, and given our current debt levels, we expect to slow our repurchase pace in the fourth quarter. 
Now to provide more details about Marriott International's 2012 outlook, I'd like to turn things over to Arne Sorenson. Arne?"

          Thanks, Carl. This the time of year where we typically provide our initial view of the upcoming year. The question of greatest interest is what should we model for REVPAR in 2012? As Carl mentioned, we are not seeing weakening demand in our business as we speak. At the same time, we read the same newspapers you do, and we can't ignore the risks. 
As you know, all other things being equal, weaker economic growth results in weaker lodging demand. So today, we are presenting a broad range of REVPAR growth assumptions. 3% REVPAR growth correlates with modest GDP growth, perhaps 1% or so, and it's hopefully too conservative. 7% REVPAR growth correlates to 2.5% to 3% GDP growth and is probably too aggressive to count on. But we present these bookends to allow investors to independently model the business as we all have different views of the future. 
We further estimate that a one-point change in worldwide REVPAR in 2012 should equate to roughly $80 million pretax of full year fees plus about $5 million pretax of owned and leased profits. These are only rules of thumb, of course. Interestingly, even with no GDP growth, we would still expect some modest REVPAR growth in North America. This is largely because of the very favorable supply environment. According to Smith Travel, supply growth is expected to increase a mere 0.5% in 2012 on top of only a 0.7% growth in 2011. Given the supply environment, we believe it is very unlikely we'll see North American REVPAR decline in the absence of a pronounced downturn in the economy. 
In fact, in a recent report, Raymond James noted that since January 1988, the earliest data they've looked at, there has not been a single month of negative REVPAR when supply growth has been less than 1%. 
Now whilst supply growth is modest, our unit growth continues. 12 months ago, we had a 95,000-room pipeline. Since then, 33,000 rooms have opened into our system, and the pipeline has risen to 105,000 rooms. Measured by newly signed rooms, 2011 will be one of our largest development years ever. Our pipeline continues to build, and it's becoming increasingly international. 10 years ago, our international development pipeline totaled 14,000 rooms. Today, we have over 47,000 rooms in our development pipeline outside the U.S. 
In Asia, today, we have roughly 100 hotels in our pipeline compared to only 60 12 months ago. With just the completion of these hotels, we'll have over 230 hotels in our Asia-Pacific region. 
We're very bullish about the long-term opportunities in the Middle East and Africa, too. As you saw on Monday, we named a new President and Managing Director of our Middle East and Africa division.  Alex Kyriakidis is currently head of Deloitte's Travel, Tourism and Lodging business in Dubai and London. Alex brings a wealth of context and insights to the region and will join us on the first of the year. We are excited about the addition of Alex to our team, although we will miss Ed Fuller, who is retiring after 40 years at Marriott, including over 20 years running our international operations. 
In the U.S., ground-up development is very challenging today. In the last 12 months, Smith Travel reports that only 47,000 rooms were added to the U.S. industry supply. In this same time period, Marriott opened roughly 3,000 conversion rooms and 12,000 newly constructed rooms, representing 1/4 of all new hotel supply growth in the U.S. Only strong brands are getting new development deals done in the U.S. today. 
Our Autograph brand continues to show strong results and considerable franchise interest. While not included in comparable hotel statistics, REVPAR for our first 14 converted Autograph hotels rose 12% for the 3 months ended in August, with REVPAR index up over 5%. With 24 hotels worldwide today, we expect to have roughly 40 properties opened or signed by year-end 2011 and 60 to 70 properties by year-end 2012. Autograph is off to a stunning start. 
We remain very bullish both about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry and near-term prospects for Marriott. With strong demand and low supply growth, a return-to-peak-2007 REVPAR is on the horizon. More importantly, our return-to-peak fee revenue from Marriott is very near. Our model implies fee revenue in 2012 of $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion, which is quite comparable to our fee revenue performance in 2007. Our base and franchise fees hold up well because they are much less susceptible to the economy, and they benefit from unit growth. 
Since the third quarter of 2007, our rooms have increased from over 525,000 rooms to nearly 640,000 rooms. We expect to open roughly 5,000 rooms in the fourth quarter of this year, 30,000 rooms for the full year of 2011 and another 30,000 rooms in 2012. 
We expect to achieve growth in rooms with modest net invested capital. We also expect to generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow. In the past 4 years, we have reduced fully diluted shares outstanding by nearly 10% as we applied excess cash flow to repurchase 62 million shares. In 2012, we expect to have another $500 million to $1 billion of cash available for share repurchase or opportunistic investing.  In fact, even if we only see a 3% REVPAR growth, we would expect some level of share repurchase activity in 2012. 
While we announced the Timeshare spinoff in February, we know analyst models included in consensus for 2012 largely do not account for that transaction. So while we've provided a 2012 model today, we've also provided an estimate of 2011 Timeshare impact for comparability. 
Our prior peak earnings occurred in 2007. Adjusting the entire 2007 income statement for the Timeshare spinoff, our EPS in 2007 would've totaled about $1.51 per share. Assuming REVPAR rose 3% to 7% year-over-year in 2012 and further assuming we complete our spinoff by year-end 2011, diluted EPS for 2012 for Marriott International, excluding Timeshare, could total $1.48 to $1.68. This means we should exceed 2007 EPS levels even if we see a modest REVPAR growth environment. 
Our outlook is also substantially ahead of our modeled 2011 adjusted full year earnings of $1.27 to $1.31, which excludes Timeshare and the Timeshare transaction costs. While there's a great deal of uncertainty around the economy, there is much we do know. Group revenue on the books is up 7% for 2012, and U.S. government per diems are up 4% to 7%, depending on the market. We'll have to see how special negotiated corporate rates turn out, but our strong book of group business gives us some negotiating leverage. 
In the August customer survey that Carl mentioned earlier, we also asked meeting planners about their plans for 2012. 2/3 of respondents indicated that their organization will have the same or greater lodging spend next year. As importantly, we see no sign of resurgence in supply growth in the U.S. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the third quarter, and Marriott International's adjusted pretax margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased from 17% in the 2010 third quarter to nearly 19% in the 2011 quarter. We are excited about the near-term launch of Marriott Vacations Worldwide as the leading pure-play Timeshare company in the world.  With the finest brands, they will have tremendous opportunity for growth going forward. 
We are excited about being a focused hotel management and franchise company, and we are excited about our continued unit growth and the substantial worldwide growth opportunities for our brands. We're pleased to take your questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] Melissa?"

And just as part of that, we continue to hear, despite your opening remarks about Sales Force One, kind of mixed feedback and specifically some concerns around how the system is working in more regional or suburban markets versus in central business districts where maybe it's more effective, and I was just wondering if you could comment on that."

          Okay, that's your one question with 2 parts, Smedes. Let me start with -- I think the most powerful statistic on group bookings is the one that we include in the prepared remarks, which is group business on the books for 2012.  This is for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts managed comp hotels is up 7% in revenue compared to the same time last year. And that reflects really continued strong bookings. We thought it was very interesting that in period 9, which is largely the month of August for us, group bookings that were made for the next 12 months were up 14% from the same period last year. As we all know, August was the month where probably the anxiety in the marketplace turned most intense.  And so we were quite comforted by that activity.  And even as we closed that period 9 and closed our third quarter, when we look at the bookings that we're working on that have not yet been made, so we're really talking about the funnel there, the funnel was up over, say, 17% from the same period last year. So all of that gives us at least the basis to say that there's no sign that the weakness has shown up yet. And the way companies are acting today, they still seem to be prepared to make commitments for their business going forward. Carl had some statistics about sales transformation and the pitching and catching.  We'll do $150 million to $200 million this year easily in business that is pitched from one sales office to a very different market across the country. That's the kind of activity that's made possible by the sales transformation program that we've got. We obviously have just completed in roughly July 1 the rollout of this program to all of the markets in the United States. There's nothing dramatic that we can report to you other than we feel like we're continuing to make progress. And obviously, it's a big enough change, so we continue to talk to our owners about it.  And we do make some adjustments as we go forward, but we're feeling reasonably good about the progress of that program today."

I think it's one of the reasons we feel positive about the way that program is developing. When you talk about Smith Travel numbers for group, that tends to be more of a paid and stayed measure, so what happened in Q3. And there, I think we're continuing to see that group business in Q3 was weaker than transient business. We think most of that is economic cyclicality.  Group business tends to come back a little bit more slowly.  And some of that is the impact of the D.C. market, where we've got a number of big boxes, and obviously, that's a little bit weaker."

          Well, I think there are a couple of things. We would expect that sales transformation will help us take incremental market share as it gets further and further established and delivers more and more results. I think to some extent, the economic cycle and impact on transient and group business will be a factor we continue to deal with. So in a growing economic environment, transient will tend to grow faster than group. Now do we have a growing economic environment and how fast is it growing, you can make that call."

          Yes. So Europe, Carl's comments talked about the U.K. provinces, which I think is the one meaningful market for us where we've seen some slowdown, and we think that's by and large driven by U.K. government belt-tightening. We have only one hotel in Greece, and so that hotel in Athens is not very material to our results, and to tell you the truth, I can't really tell you exactly what's happening in Greece in terms of demand trends in that market. But when we look across the rest of Europe, we actually see a surprisingly strong performance, notwithstanding the incredible newspaper stories we seem to read every day on the rounds of crisis that we've got really coming out of the Greece and Spain and Italy at this point. I think we'll continue to watch Europe carefully as we go forward. I think implicit in the numbers we've got within that 3% to 7% range next year is relatively more modest growth in Europe than in other parts of the world. And I think a bit of that is their fare schedule, which is relevant, a bit more relevant to the way their -- our business reports there than it is in other parts of the world. So I think part of that is just a bit more modest expectations for those economies, generally. China and Asia continue to move spectacularly well. Obviously, they're looking at a residential bubble, particularly in the property space, and trying to discern whether they have one, and if they do, what to do about it.  It, by and large, is not impacting the pace by which we're taking new hotels into our pipeline in China.  The hotels there in our pipeline of 105,000 rooms are 90% under construction in China, some number like that, and will represent the bulk of what we open into mid-2012. It is the case, though, that often we sign management contracts for hotel which have been put under construction before we've signed that contract. And we are working on dozens of hotels in China alone that we're still optimistic we'll be able to sign here over the next few quarters. So at this point, it's all systems-go for us. And I think one of the really positive things about China is notwithstanding the difficulty of the World Expo comparisons, which started to hit in Q3.  The demand trends in China and much of the rest of Asia are surprising to the upside and don't show any signs of losing momentum."

Next year, that number may be higher, moderately higher, leaving us, like I said, $500 million to $1 billion of discretionary cash, so to speak, that would be available for share repurchase or opportunistic investment, which may include the acquisition of a hotel or a repositioning or investments in a small acquisition of several hotels or something like that.

We have obviously been really active in the market year-to-date, with about 36 million shares purchased.

In the quarter, for the quarter, you only get a certain amount of it, and on a year-to-date basis, you don't really get that much impact. So the EPS numbers are really not driven for 2012 by share repurchase activity that has not been done today. Our model tends to assume that we're going to buy stock at valuations which would be significantly above where the market value is today, and in part, because of that -- because you don't get the full year benefit of that, there really isn't much EPS contribution from future purchases."

          It's lower at 3% and higher at 7%. Yes, we don't have percentages to give you yet. We're not that far advanced in our model. But I think one of the things which is actually stunning, I used some comparisons of 2012 and what it might look like compared to 2007, I think the likelihood is that we will see total fee performance for Marriott International at or maybe modestly above 2007 levels. But what's happening under that grand total is a dramatic increase in the stability of that fee bucket. So if you look back at 2007, we'll have to go check the records to be sure, but I think it was like $369 million of incentive fees, which were majority in the United States, which obviously have a risk profile which is different from incentive fees outside the United States, and incentive fees have a risk profile which is meaningfully different from base and franchise fees. When we look at 2007, we'll see total fees for the company much higher -- not much higher, excuse me, but roughly the same level as 2007. We'll see the total incentive fee bucket lower in nominal dollars.  Therefore, you've got more stability in the base and franchise fees and a much higher portion of the incentive fees that we do have being internationally driven, which are also lower risk. I think you can come up with some assumptions here which shouldn't put you too far off if you look at base -- rooms revenue growth and unit growth. You can make some assumptions about what's happening in the incentive fee line based on those 3% to 7% scenarios."

          Yes, we're very early in the process of our conversations with our special corporate accounts. I think we can say with confidence rates will be up. I think among the things that are interesting, I had our look made at September occupancies, and I think basically, what we're seeing is that for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand as an example, September occupancies in 2011 were essentially exactly the same as September occupancies in 2007. That's domestic, yes, not global. And I think you can see when you look at Smith Travel data and some of the other data which is out there in the marketplace, in many recent months, the U.S. lodging industry has seen record demand. What do we mean by that? We mean that our customers, for the industry as a whole, are buying more total rooms than they purchased in 2007. And I think that occupancy is one of the positive attributes of this round of negotiations with our special corporate accounts. Obviously, pricing will vary a little bit by market to market. Where occupancy is higher, we'll have a bit more leverage. To some extent, that will allow us to drive rates within the accounts, and at the same time, beyond that, it will allow us to yield some accounts where we're bringing in higher rate and special corporate accounts and probably, in effect, yielding away some special corporate accounts which are not quite as strong. In terms of dynamic pricing, I think generally, that is not material for us. I wouldn't pretend to be an expert in that. There are a number of different tools, obviously, that are used in special corporate negotiations.  That include such powerful things as last room availability and to what extent that's being provided to accounts. And that's probably a bigger factor in what we're doing now than dynamic pricing is."

          Sure, this is Carl. I think as you step back and you look at the incentive fees from the select service brands, primarily the Courtyard brand, a lot of those incentive fees are computed on a pooled basis rather than a property-by-property basis. So you have some large portfolios that that computation for incentive fees is done, like I said, on that pooled basis. So I think we'd assume it'll take a little while for those incentive fees to come back into the money. In addition, some of the bases were adjusted as a result of the Courtyard Refreshing Businesses, and therefore, the priority would be increased as a result of that. But probably, the bigger effect is the fact that they're pooled and large groups of them. So that's why as you look at the number of hotels paying incentive fees, you have to kind of adjust for these big pools because one portfolio can start paying, and that could represent 25, 50 hotels or more."

I think when we look at the model we've laid out today with this obviously fairly broad range for REVPAR but how the earnings relate to that at $1.48 to $1.68 and you look at a stock which is valued at less than $30 a share today, that strikes us as a pretty compelling valuation and not one that gives us enormous fear. I think if we sat here and thought there's a meaningful chance of a significant REVPAR decline, it might cause us to feel differently about it. But I think when you look at the absence of any supply growth in the United States, the group business on the books, the modest improvement in government rates, which will be a tailwind as opposed to a headwind as it has been this year, I think all of those things give us comfort that we are really still in an early stage of what should be a longer recovery. We're still a long way from per room rates that we had in 2007 for many business travelers.  And as a consequence, net-net, we think it's a pretty good time to use the capacity that we have. We're not reaching beyond that to step out and return some capital to our shareholders and reduce our share count."

And so when that happens, we'll, of course, issue a press release. I think as we go forward, Carl's talked about this, we will be mindful of the risks that we sense out there. But generally, we'll use the capacity that we have either to invest in our business or, if we haven't done that, to return it to our shareholders. And I suspect we'll see that continue. Our expectation would be we will not buy as much in the fourth quarter as we bought in the third quarter. A bit of that is because we're a little bit more levered now at the end of the third quarter than we were at the end of the second quarter. But we'll continue to watch this over time, and we think even at GDP levels, which are roughly flat in the United States, we could be posting positive REVPAR growth and positive cash flow and enough cash flow that probably, we'll have the ability to do some share repurchase activity even in that environment."

Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, October 6, 2011, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
Well, in the third quarter, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29, a 32% increase from our prior year. On an adjusted basis, we were at the upper end of our $0.25 to $0.29 July guidance. Our adjusted operating income was also at the upper end of our guidance, excluding spinoff transaction costs. Timeshare sales and services net was about $0.01 lower than expected, largely due to reportability. On the plus side, stronger-than-expected REVPAR increased results in our leased hotels, particularly in London and Tokyo, which gave us about $0.01 upside. We also picked up about $0.01 each from termination fees, tax rate and share count. 
North American transient demand remained very strong in the third quarter. System-wide North American REVPAR rose 7%, at the high end of our expectation with most markets showing significant REVPAR improvement, including double-digit REVPAR growth in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. 
In the greater Washington D.C. market, system-wide REVPAR declined 2%. Demand continues to be constrained by the shortened congressional calendar, ongoing budget battles, weak government group demand and, in this quarter, Hurricane Irene. Fortunately, better group bookings in D.C. and an increase in the government per diem should help the fourth quarter. 
North American system-wide Courtyard REVPAR rose 8% in the quarter. We are seeing meaningful impact from the Courtyard Refreshing Business lobby renovations. Over 370 hotels have been renovated today with another 77 properties planned for 2012. We expect to have substantially all our Courtyard properties offering the new product by year-end 2013. 
Ritz-Carlton had a terrific third quarter. North American Ritz-Carlton REVPAR rose nearly 14%. Sales of club level and suites are up, and worldwide luxury incentive fees almost doubled in the quarter. We launched Ritz-Carlton Rewards last year, and we've already signed up more than 150,000 members. Today, Ritz-Carlton's worldwide hotel development pipeline stands at nearly 6,000 rooms, largely in international markets. These rooms represent a more than 40% increase on the existing Ritz-Carlton International room base. 
Company-operated REVPAR for the domestic Marriott brand increased 4% in the quarter with group business up 2%. Catering sales also rose 2% in the quarter. Group business was impacted by weak government group demand in D.C. and the slow return of association group business. 
Our sales executives continue to do a great job. For 2012, total revenue bookings for the Marriott brand are running up 7% year-over-year compared to only 3% pace in February. Bookings made in the third quarter for 2 years out, in this case, 2013, are up 31% year-over-year. One of the key benefits of our new sales organization in the U.S. is the pitching and catching of meeting prospects between regions. This is possible because we now have the systems, the training and the incentives for sales executives to sell our system rather than a single hotel. For group business booked in the first 3 quarters of 2011, nearly 900,000 room nights were obtained by sales executives selling business going to hotels outside their regions, which represented roughly 7% of all group revenue booked. We believe this is largely incremental business and is significantly ahead of our expectations. 
The new sales organization is also doing well when we examine more intangible measures. Our customer response time, sales quality and follow-up performance are closely monitored and continue to improve. In fact, Marriott sales office response time is industry-leading in the third quarter according to a third-party survey.  Our customers are delighted. In mid-August, we surveyed 4,500 industry group meeting planners. 2/3 said that no other lodging company is easier to do business with than Marriott, and 80% said they are more likely to do business with Marriott brands in 2012 than in 2011. 
Our U.S. sales organization is calling on 7x more U.S. accounts than in the past. With our unique organization structure, we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of business from key international markets such as China, India and Europe. While we continue to tweak the organization, we are gratified by these excellent results. 
We just signed a global distribution agreement with bookings.com, the largest online travel agency in Europe, which is expanding its presence within the U.S. market. In contrast to the merchant model, the booking.com commissionable model arranges for a benefiting hotel to pay a commission after the stay. While OTAs will continue to represent a very small portion of our overall business, we expect this agreement will improve our efficiency and revenue over time.  Incidentally, we are also negotiating our Expedia contract, which is scheduled for a renewal later this year. 
Performance outside North America was impressive. Comparable system-wide REVPAR was strong throughout Asia, rising 9% on a constant dollar basis and 17% reflecting actual exchange rates. Comparable REVPAR in Europe increased 6% on a constant dollar basis and 18%, including currency, with particular strength in London and Paris.  The Middle East remains a challenging market, but REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased 12%. Finally, REVPAR in Japan is bouncing back ahead of expectations. Local Japanese demand is strengthening, and Japanese travel to Korea has resumed. House profit margin in the third quarter for domestic company-operated properties increased 130 basis points, reflecting higher occupancy, improved room rates and good cost controls. House profit margins for international hotels increased 40 basis points, constrained by weak REVPAR in the Middle East. 
Worldwide base and franchise fee revenue rose 12% in the third quarter, and incentive fees were up 38% in the seasonally slow period. Incentive fees were particularly strong in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. 
Our owned and leased profits increased dramatically year-over-year in part due to $8 million in higher termination fees, $13 million improvement in branding fees from our credit card and residential sales and $7 million from stronger results at our leased hotels, particularly in Anaheim and London. 
For our Timeshare business, third quarter contract sales were ahead of expectations due to stronger sales at a joint venture project, while North America vacation ownership sales were right in line. Timeshare sales and services net was lower than we expected, largely due to lower revenue reportability, some ADA compliance costs and costs associated with Hurricane Irene in the Bahamas. 
Adjusted general and administrative expenses rose 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff transaction, higher costs associated with our international expansion and higher incentive compensation. Workout costs were a bit lower than expected largely due to timing. Adjusting out the $8 million of expenses associated with the spinoff, G&A came in at $162 million, a bit better than the $165 million to $170 million guidance. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, our international REVPAR growth is likely to slow from the third quarter pace. Many of our newer comparable hotels in Asia have benefited from ramp-up in recent quarters, and the fourth quarter will reflect tougher comps. REVPAR in Europe will likely moderate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of this year's fairs in Germany, as well as tougher comparables. REVPAR in London is expected to remain strong, but we anticipate weak performance in the British provinces as a result of government austerity efforts. 
So for the fourth quarter, we are assuming international system-wide REVPAR growth to increase 3% to 5% on a constant dollar basis or 5% to 7% excluding the Middle East and Japan. 
In North America, we expect system-wide REVPAR growth of 6% to 8%. Across North America, we see little evidence of economic slowdown in our lodging business. Group cancellations and attrition levels are running at normal levels. In fact, group attendance is running a bit higher than meeting planner expectations at many hotels. 
For our Timeshare business, our guidance assumes the business will spin off from Marriott at year-end 2011. On this basis, we expect fourth quarter contract sales to total $200 million to $210 million and Timeshare sales and services net to total $68 million to $73 million. Similarly, we would expect Timeshare segment results would total $45 million to $50 million, reflecting continued reductions in interest income as outstanding mortgage balances continue to decline. This places full year 2011 adjusted Timeshare segment results at $131 million to $136 million. These full year segment results are roughly $10 million below our prior guidance, largely due to deferred revenue reportability and the timing impact of the banking and borrowing option under our points-based program. As we mentioned last quarter, more owners are choosing to bank their points for a more expansive vacation in 2012. 
On this basis, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share to total $0.45 to $0.50 per share, a 15% to 28% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. For the full year 2011, we expect adjusted EPS will increase 19% to 23% to $1.37 to $1.42. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA will climb 7% to 8% compared to last year's adjusted amount. Our guidance assumes the spinoff will not occur until year-end 2011 and, again, includes the $13 million pretax we’ve spent on year-to-date spinoff costs but excludes future spinoff costs. 
On a cash basis, we estimate the total cash transaction costs related to the spin at $40 million to $50 million for the full year 2011. We have already expensed about $13 million of this through the income statement year-to-date. Not all of the $40 million to $50 million will be expensed in 2011 as some will be capitalized. 
While our guidance assumes Timeshare will remain with Marriott through the fourth quarter, it is actually more likely the business will spin off prior to year-end 2011. An updated Form 10 was filed last week. Commitments on the new revolver have been obtained, and the agreement is on track to be executed this month. 
S&P has rated MVW Credit at BB-. In coming days, we expect to receive an IRS private letter ruling confirming that the distribution of MVW shares will be tax-free to Marriott and its shareholders. MVW's new receivables warehouse facility has closed and funded. The MVW team will hold their first Analyst Meeting at the New York Marriott Marquis on October 28, 2011. Invitations will go out soon. Management looks forward to meeting with you and discussing their prospects, including their outlook for 2012. 
They expect to conduct a roadshow with Deutsche Bank in November, and we still need to finish some intercompany agreements, complete the Form 10 and receive final board approval. We expect to complete this necessary work and present the transaction to our board by the end of October, distributing shares to shareholders around the end of November. 
With this transaction, Marriott expects to receive approximately $325 million to $350 million in cash tax benefits through 2015, including $70 million to $80 million in cash tax benefits in 2011 and $120 million to $130 million in 2012. 
Through the third quarter, we've already realized roughly $55 million in cash tax benefits. To be clear, this transaction does not materially change our book tax rate. These are only cash tax benefits equivalent to about $1 per share in value. 
While we aren't completing our typical note securitization this year, we've already received most of the $110 million we expect under the MVW warehouse facility. Combined with the roughly $40 million in proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock of MVW's U.S. holding company, Marriott International should receive approximately $150 million in a cash distribution in the fourth quarter prior to completion of the transaction. This will have no impact on Marriott's earnings. 
With regard to earnings, we estimate the Timeshare business, net of the transaction costs, will contribute roughly $0.10 to $0.11 to our estimated full year 2011 EPS. The calculation is on Page A-18 in the earnings release we put out last night. 
Once the spinoff is complete, Marriott International will not account for the Timeshare business as a discontinued operations. We expect to provide detailed and more precise pro forma income statements for the new Marriott for 2010 and 2011 shortly after the spinoff. 
By the way, we expect Marriott Vacations Worldwide will file their own 10-Q for the third quarter as a standalone company once the spin is complete. 
For 2011, we assume $500 million to $600 million in Marriott investment spending, including $50 million to $100 million in maintenance spending. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 36 million shares for over $1.2 billion through the end of the quarter, and given our current debt levels, we expect to slow our repurchase pace in the fourth quarter. 
Now to provide more details about Marriott International's 2012 outlook, I'd like to turn things over to Arne Sorenson. Arne?"

This is the time of year where we typically provide our initial view of the upcoming year. The question of greatest interest is what should we model for REVPAR in 2012? As Carl mentioned, we are not seeing weakening demand in our business as",1278,"Thanks, Carl. This is the time of year where we typically provide our initial view of the upcoming year. The question of greatest interest is what should we model for REVPAR in 2012? As Carl mentioned, we are not seeing weakening demand in our business as we speak. At the same time, we read the same newspapers you do, and we can't ignore the risk. 
As you know, all other things being equal, weaker economic growth results in weaker lodging demand. So today, we are presenting a broad range of REVPAR growth assumptions. 3% REVPAR growth correlates with modest GDP growth, perhaps 1% or so, and is hopefully too conservative. 7% REVPAR growth correlates to 2.5% to 3% GDP growth and is probably too aggressive to count on. But we present these bookends to allow investors to independently model the business as we all have different views of the future. 
We further estimate that a one-point change in worldwide REVPAR in 2012 should equate to roughly $18 million pretax of full year fees, plus about $5 million pretax of owned and leased profits. These are only rules of thumb, of course. Interestingly, even with no GDP growth, we would still expect some modest REVPAR growth in North America. This is largely because of the very favorable supply environment. According to Smith Travel, supply growth is expected to increase a mere 0.5% in 2012 on top of only a 0.7% growth in 2011. Given the supply environment, we believe it is very unlikely we'll see North American REVPAR decline in the absence of a pronounced downturn in the economy. 
In fact, in a recent report, Raymond James noted that since January 1988, the earliest data they looked at, there has not been a single month of negative REVPAR when supply growth has been less than 1%. 
Now whilst supply growth is modest, our unit growth continues. 12 months ago, we had a 95,000-room pipeline. Since then, 33,000 rooms have opened into our system, and the pipeline has risen to 105,000 rooms. Measured by newly signed rooms, 2011 will be one of our largest development years ever. Our pipeline continues to build, and it's becoming increasingly international. 10 years ago, our international development pipeline totaled 14,000 rooms. Today, we have over 47,000 rooms in our development pipeline outside the U.S. 
In Asia, today, we have roughly 100 hotels in our pipeline compared to only 60 12 months ago. With just the completion of these hotels, we'll have over 230 hotels in our Asia-Pacific region. 
We're very bullish about the long-term opportunities in the Middle East and Africa, too. As you saw on Monday, we named a new President and Managing Director of our Middle East and Africa division.  Alex Kyriakidis is currently head of Deloitte's Travel, Tourism and Lodging business in Dubai and London. Alex brings a wealth of contacts and insights to the region and will join us on the first of the year. We are excited about the addition of Alex to our team, although we will miss Ed Fuller, who is retiring after 40 years at Marriott, including over 20 years running our international operations. 
In the U.S., ground-up development is very challenging today. In the last 12 months, Smith Travel reports that only 47,000 rooms were added to the U.S. industry supply. In this same time period, Marriott opened roughly 3,000 conversion rooms and 12,000 newly constructed rooms, representing 1/4 of all new hotel supply growth in the U.S. Only strong brands are getting new development deals done in the U.S. today. 
Our Autograph brand continues to show strong results and considerable franchise interest. While not included in comparable hotel statistics, REVPAR for our first 14 converted Autograph hotels rose 12% for the 3 months ended in August, with REVPAR index up over 5%. With 24 hotels worldwide today, we expect to have roughly 40 properties opened or signed by year-end 2011 and 60 to 70 properties by year-end 2012. Autograph is off to a stunning start. 
We remain very bullish, both about the long-term prospects for the lodging industry and near-term prospects for Marriott. With strong demand and low supply growth, a return to peak 2007 REVPAR is on the horizon. More importantly, a return to peak fee revenue from Marriott is very near. Our model implies fee revenue in 2012 of $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion, which is quite comparable to our fee revenue performance in 2007. Our base and franchise fees hold up well because they are much less susceptible to the economy, and they benefit from unit growth. 
Since the third quarter of 2007, our rooms have increased from over 525,000 rooms to nearly 640,000 rooms. We expect to open roughly 5,000 rooms in the fourth quarter of this year, 30,000 rooms for the full year of 2011 and another 30,000 rooms in 2012. 
We expect to achieve growth in rooms with modest net invested capital. We also expect to generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow. In the past 4 years, we have reduced fully diluted shares outstanding by nearly 10% as we applied excess cash flow to repurchase 62 million shares. In 2012, we expect to have another $500 million to $1 billion of cash available for share repurchase or opportunistic investing.  In fact, even if we only see 3% REVPAR growth, we would expect some level of share repurchase activity in 2012. 
While we announced the Timeshare spinoff in February, we know analyst models included in consensus for 2012 largely do not account for that transaction. So while we've provided a 2012 model today, we've also provided an estimate of 2011 Timeshare impact for comparability. 
Our prior peak earnings occurred in 2007. Adjusting the entire 2007 income statement for the Timeshare spinoff, our EPS in 2007 would've totaled about $1.51 per share. Assuming REVPAR grows 3% to 7% year-over-year in 2012 and further assuming we complete our spinoff by year-end 2011, diluted EPS for 2012 for Marriott International, excluding Timeshare, could total $1.48 to $1.68. This means we should exceed 2007 EPS levels, even if we see a modest REVPAR growth environment. 
Our outlook is also substantially ahead of our modeled 2011 adjusted full year earnings of $1.27 to $1.31, which excludes Timeshare and the Timeshare transaction costs. While there's a great deal of uncertainty around the economy, there is much we do know. Group revenue on the books is up 7% for 2012, and U.S. government per diems are up 4% to 7%, depending on the market. We'll have to see how special negotiated corporate rates turn out, but our strong book of group business gives us some negotiating leverage. 
In the August customer survey that Carl mentioned earlier, we also asked meeting planners about their plans for 2012. 2/3 of respondents indicated that their organization will have the same or greater lodging spend next year. As importantly, we see no sign of resurgence in supply growth in the U.S. 
We continue to control costs. Operating margins of our company-operated hotels improved in the third quarter, and Marriott International's adjusted pretax margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased from 17% in the 2010 third quarter to nearly 19% in the 2011 quarter. We are excited about the near-term launch of Marriott Vacations Worldwide as the leading pure-play Timeshare company in the world with the finest brands. They will have tremendous opportunity for growth going forward. 
We are excited about being a focused hotel management and franchise company, and we are excited about our continued unit growth and the substantial worldwide growth opportunities for our brands. We're pleased to take your questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] Melissa?"

This is for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts managed comp hotels is up 7% in revenue compared to the same time last year. And that reflects really continued strong bookings. We thought it was very interesting that in period 9, which is largely the month of August for us, group bookings that were made for the next 12 months were up 14% from the same period last year. As we all know, August was the month where probably the anxiety in the marketplace turned the most intense.  And so we were quite comforted by that activity. And even as we closed that period 9 and closed our third quarter, when we look at the bookings that we're working on that have not yet been made, so we're really talking about the funnel there, the funnel was up over, say, 17% from the same period last year. So all of that gives us at least the basis to say that there's no sign that the weakness has shown up yet. And the way companies are acting today, they still seem to be prepared to make commitments for their business going forward. Carl had some statistics about sales transformation and the pitching and catching with -- we'll do $150 million to $200 million this year easily in business that is pitched from one sales office to a very different market across the country. That's the kind of activity that's made possible by the sales transformation program that we've got. We obviously have just completed in roughly July 1 the rollout of this program to all of the markets in the United States. There's nothing dramatic that we can report to you other than we feel like we're continuing to make progress. And obviously, it's a big enough change that we continue to talk to our owners about it.  And we do make some adjustments as we go forward, but we're feeling reasonably good about the progress of that program today."

We have only one hotel in Greece, and so that hotel in Athens is not very material to our results, and to tell you the truth, I can't really tell you exactly what's happening in Greece in terms of demand trends in that market. But when we look across the rest of Europe, we actually see a surprisingly strong performance, notwithstanding the incredible newspaper stories we seem to read every day and the rounds of crisis that we've got really coming out of the Greece and Spain and Italy at this point. I think we'll continue to watch Europe carefully as we go forward. I think implicit in the numbers we've got within that 3% to 7% range next year is relatively more modest growth in Europe than in other parts of the world. And I think a bit of that is their fare schedule, which is relevant, a bit more relevant to the way their -- our business reports there than it is in other parts of the world. So I think part of that is just a bit more modest expectations for those economies, generally. China and Asia continue to move spectacularly well. Obviously, they're looking at a residential bubble, particularly in the property space, and trying to discern whether they have one and, if they do, what to do about it.  It, by and large, is not impacting the pace by which we're taking new hotels into our pipeline in China.  The hotels that are in our pipeline of 105,000 rooms are 90% under construction in China, some number like that, and will represent the bulk of what we open into mid-2012. It is the case, though, that often we sign management contracts for hotels which have been put under construction before we've signed that contract. And we are working on dozens of hotels in China alone that we're still optimistic we'll be able to sign here over the next few quarters. So at this point, it's all-systems-go for us. And I think one of the really positive things about China is, notwithstanding the difficulty of the World Expo comparisons, which started to hit in Q3, the demand trends in China and much of the rest of Asia are surprising to the upside and don't show any signs of losing momentum."

Next year, that number may be higher, moderately higher, leaving us, like I said, $500 million to $1 billion of discretionary cash, so to speak, that would be available for share repurchase or opportunistic investment, which may include the acquisition of a hotel or a repositioning for investments in a small acquisition of several hotels or something like that. Nothing on the table right now, but it's in there a bit."

In the quarter, for the quarter, you only get a certain amount of it, and on a year-to-date basis, you don't really get that much impact. So the EPS numbers are really not driven for 2012 by share repurchase activity that has not been done today.

But I think one of the things which is actually stunning, I used some comparisons of 2012 and what it might look like compared to 2007, I think the likelihood is that we will see total fee performance for Marriott International at or maybe modestly above 2007 levels. But what's happening under that grand total is a dramatic increase in the stability of that fee bucket. So if you look back at 2007, we'll have to go check the records to be sure, but I think it was like $369 million of incentive fees, which were majority in the United States, which obviously have a risk profile which is different from incentive fees outside the United States, and incentive fees have a risk profile which is meaningfully different from base and franchise fees. When we look at 2007, we'll see total fees for the company much higher -- not much higher, excuse me, but roughly the same level as 2007. We'll see the total incentive fee bucket lower in nominal dollars.  Therefore, you've got more stability in the base and franchise fees and a much higher portion of the incentive fees that we do have being internationally driven, which are also lower risk. I think you can come up with some assumptions here which shouldn't put you too far off if you look at base -- rooms revenue growth and unit growth. You can make some assumptions about what's happening in the incentive fee line based on those 3% to 7% scenarios."

I think we can say with confidence rates will be up. I think among the things that are interesting, I had a look made at September occupancies, and I think, basically, what we're seeing is that for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand as an example, September occupancies in 2011 were essentially exactly the same as September occupancies in 2007. That's domestic, yes, not global. And I think you can see when you look at Smith Travel data and some of the other data which is out there in the marketplace, in many recent months, the U.S. lodging industry has seen record demand. What do we mean by that? We mean that our customers, for the industry as a whole, are buying more total rooms than they purchased in 2007. And I think that occupancy is one of the positive attributes of this round of negotiations with our special corporate accounts. Obviously, pricing will vary a little bit by market to market. And where occupancy is higher, we'll have a bit more leverage. To some extent, that will allow us to drive rates within the accounts, and at the same time, beyond that, it will allow us to yield some accounts where we're bringing in higher rated special corporate accounts and probably, in effect, yielding away some special corporate accounts which are not quite as strong. In terms of dynamic pricing, I think, generally, that is not material for us. I wouldn't pretend to be an expert in that. There are a number of different tools, obviously, that are used in special corporate negotiations that include such powerful things as last room availability and to what extent that's being provided to accounts. And that's probably a bigger factor in what we're doing now than dynamic pricing is."

I think as you step back and you look at the incentive fees from the select service brands, primarily the Courtyard brand, a lot of those incentive fees are computed on a pooled basis rather than a property-by-property basis. So you have some large portfolios that computation for incentive fees is done, like I said, on that pooled basis. So I think you should assume that it'll take a little while for those incentive fees to come back into the money. In addition, some of the bases were adjusted as a result of the Courtyard Refreshing Businesses, and therefore, the priority would be increased as a result of that. But probably, the bigger effect is the fact that they're pooled and large groups of them. So that's why as you look at the number of hotels paying incentive fees, you have to kind of adjust for these big pools because one portfolio can start paying, and that could represent 25, 50 hotels or more."

I think if we sat here and thought there's a meaningful chance of a significant REVPAR decline, it might cause us to feel differently about it. But I think when you look at the absence of any supply growth in the United States, the group business on the books, the modest improvement in government rates, which will be a tailwind as opposed to a headwind as it has been this year, I think all of those things give us comfort that we are really still in an early stage of what should be a longer recovery. We're still a long way from per room rates that we had in 2007 for many business travelers.  And as a consequence, net-net, we think it's a pretty good time to use the capacity that we have.

A bit of that is because we're a little bit more levered now at the end of the third quarter than we were at the end of the second quarter.
