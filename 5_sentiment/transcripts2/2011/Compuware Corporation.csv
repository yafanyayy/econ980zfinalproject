Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3's year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The high",1689,"Thanks, Lisa. Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3's year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The highlights for the quarter includes strong performance in our Mainframe, Covisint and professional services business. 
Compuware is now consistently achieving business success. We met or exceeded consensus analyst, set expectations for EPS for six straight quarters. We are vigilantly managing our margins ensuring profitability in our mature businesses. Simultaneously, we're investing in the businesses that will drive Compuware's breakout growth, both in revenues and in earnings in the years ahead. 
For application performance management, we find ourselves with the best in class solution in a high-growth category. Most companies today are in investing in strategic web-based apps due to the promise of top line revenue growth, improved market share and brand awareness. This dramatic increase in web-based applications, cloud computing, mobile devices and virtualization all driving need for greater visibility of application performance inside and outside the firewall. Compuware has the only solution to this problem that offers a single dashboard with deep dive analytics across the entire application delivery chain, giving executives and practitioners critical performance information. This capabilities create significant separation from our competitors. Furthermore, we have the ability to measure the apps performance based upon the end user experience, which is the point where IT delivers value to the business.
This is the only meaningful way of solving the problem and only Compuware can do it. Our intention is to further this competitive GAAP with more disruptive, value based capabilities in the coming quarters. This fiscal year, we've gained well over 400 new application performance management customers, a rapid rate of market penetration that are expected to increase.
Gomez has become one of the most important solutions in the Internet business. Q3 was the best bookings quarter in Gomez' history, with 31% year-over-year bookings growth on a pro forma basis to more than $28 million. Gomez also delivered nearly 26% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis to $18 million. We added 133 net new Gomez customers in Q3. We continue to mature our ability to sell and deliver Gomez internationally. In Q3, we added a number of cornerstone international customers including a leading sports apparel brand, the world second largest telecom company and one of the world's most important data protection firms. Our infrastructure expansion will continue outside of North America, which will further bolster our growth in coming quarters.
Total APM revenues made up of Gomez and Vantage were strong year-over-year. In fact, up 34% on a GAAP basis. Vantage license fees and maintenance were both up year-over-year and sequentially but just short of our goals due to nothing more than a few deals slipping at the end of the quarter. As a result, our overall Q4 pipeline for Vantage is stronger than we expected. 
In Q3, we also strengthens our competitive position in APM with our acquisition of Basque systems. This is a great example of gaining competitive advantage faster and cheaper than we can build it. For nonmaterial cost, this advanced analytics engine will help us win more business through predictive monitoring and business analytics on top of the platform. This capability is a key part of our three-year road map and will start to have a revenue impact in Q2 of fiscal year '12. 
In Q3, we also executed the a controlled launch of First Mile, which is going as well as any launch in Compuware history. As a reminder, First Mile is a pre-configured appliance with the integrated Gomez and Vantage solution that is up running within minutes. This controlled launch is giving us the information and positive feedback we need to execute flawlessly on a broader solution launch. We will launch a vertical industry release our First Mile next week for the retail industry, and move forward with specific solutions for other industry segments in the months ahead. We believe First Mile provide us with the best opportunity to become the global standard for APM in the years to come. The overall solution value and time to achieve that value are unprecedented in the industry, and certainly can't be matched through handshake partnerships.
Furthermore, the rate of innovation on this fast-paced platform will allow our customers to achieve best in class capabilities rapidly. 
Our Covisint solution for secured collaboration proves an outstanding Q3, featuring nearly 33% of revenue growth. This growth was driven largely by healthcare revenue, which increased more than 42% in the quarter. Our healthcare segment produced several notable revenues including Northeast and Pennsylvania health information exchange, the Vermont blueprint for health initiative, and we just recently announced the greater Tulsa Health Association network. We are well on track to having four state health information exchanges by the end of the year, obviously, conditional timing on the state based decision with additional growth coming from hospitals, medical associations and physician practices. Our quality of care and outcome-based solutions are making a substantial difference in our competitive positioning. 
In Q4, a larger portion of Covisint recognized revenue will be driven by patient quality reporting initiative. Covisint's a leading submitter of such data to medicate and are our capacity for supporting outcomes based care will propel future increases in revenue.
The manufacturing vertical for Covisint is showing renewed vigor with the more than 27% year-over-year. We're also establishing a market leadership position in the oil and gas, a position we intend to solidify in the coming quarters. 
In Q3, Covisint backlog grew to nearly $140 million. Bottom line, the Covisint business is growing aggressively with no end in sight. Our biggest objective is to scale thoughtfully without compromising one dip of quality. Partners remain a critical component of our strategy, with their ability to drive incremental revenue and brand awareness at a lower cost of sales. Both Cisco and Accenture continue to produce meaningful revenue as we gear up to drive greater market opportunities for all of our partners. Our continued focus on manage service providers in the cloud and outsources are paying off as we close two multi-year commitments this quarter with global service providers. 
Partners have brought us in the business like the Olympics games, bombardier and AstraZeneca. Our partner focused also extends our capacity for executing in high growth markets. Working with companies like Hitachi, Verizon, AT&T, ATL and Accenture were significantly increasing our footprint in Brazil, India and China. During fiscal year '12, through these partners in Asia Pac and Europe, we'll launch offerings for cloud computing that feature Compuware solutions.
We are also having success with our CloudSleuth.net performance portal where we now have 14 Managed Services onboard and another 10 that are currently being on boarded. This initiative will not only drive incremental revenues but will expand our though leadership position. 
Compuware's mainframe solution had a solid Q3 with a nearly 34% increase in license fees year-over-year. We've seen some upticks from the Z10 release that I will expect to continue over the coming years. Renewals remain well over 90% of the value we delivered continues to be validated by the marketplace. Reducing mainframe operating cost, improving program productivity and a transitioning labor force remained key market drivers for these very important solutions. The environment remains competitive. We are the market leaders in the productivity tools category and as such continue to win.
Compuware's Professional Services business is another positive turn around story. For yet another quarter, the business produced improved margins year-over-year and grew both revenues and margins sequentially. We have achieved what we expected to be our Q4 goal in Q3 with a state goal of 15% margin, with a core professional services margin of 17%, excluding the solutions delivery group. Our focus on differentiated service offerings will allow us to grow that margin even more next year. Our Solution delivery group is showing consistent improvement, which is the key to further revenue and margin expansion of our overall services numbers. Uniface continues to surpass solid margins and improved license revenue growth. Uniface's ability to delivery rich Internet two-tier and cloud applications makes it a logical choice development cycles decrease and environments become much more Internet-based.
Our Changepoint results in Q3 were not as strong as we had anticipated. Our more focused go-to market approach for the solution has great appears to be rebounding nicely this quarter in Q4.
Just a quick word around the next step in the company's organizational structure. Starting in April, Compuware will be organized around solution business units. This structure will maximize operational visibility for management and investors while increasing focus, agility, customer responsiveness and win rates for every line of business. We'll tell you much more about these plans in our Q4 conference call.
Our strategy is working, and we will continue to strive to deliver market-leading solutions with even greater improvement in operational efficiencies. As we've discussed for fiscal year '12, there are many levers that will drive Compuware's topline growth and margin expansion. Our market-leading matured businesses are profitable and stable, our SaaS solution are two of the fastest-growing in the world. Our growth drivers are realizing the potential of moving the positions of dominance in there over the $1 billion categories. the drive to capitalize our competitive advantage is what keeps us up at night. We have the opportunity to build Compuware APM with $2 billion, 40% margin business. Covisint is already the name brand solution for securely sharing information in complex industries. With Covisint's market leadership established we'll focus on taking advantage of rejuvenation at the manufacturing industry and billion dollars flowing in the healthcare. 
Meanwhile, we'll continue to execute on the fundamentals. We need to meet our Q4 and full year goals. We are comfortable with the consensus analysts estimates for Q4 and for the full year. As always, there's work to be done in hitting our Q4 target completing a strong growth plan for fiscal year '12. We have the remarkable people and the solutions to make it happen. Not only achieve consistency in growth, our focus is to accelerate that growth.

This quarter's results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year topline revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20%, up from 15.7% from the year ago period and 18% last quarter. Our efforts to grow the business while keeping costs in line continue to show results. 
In terms of cost, total operating expenses for the quarter came in at $197 million within our stated guidance of $195 million to $200 million. We have a firm grant on expense management across the company with the singular focus on tactful investment as it presents the greatest promise. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%. The lower than anticipated tax rate for this quarter is primarily attributable to the passage of tax legislation in December that included among other things, the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credit back to January 1, 2010. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to come in at 36%.
For the first nine months of fiscal year '11, operating cash flow was $35.8 million. Obviously, we expected cash flow to be higher at this point in the are and given the importance of timing in the equation, we believe cash flow from operations will be between $175 million and $200 million for the year. While this is a disappointment, I don't believe it is a cause of concern. Numerous factors impact operating cash, including one deal closed in the quarter, payment options and the term of the transaction. Given where we are at, the $175 million is certainly attainable while the $200 million is still possible and definitely the target we are aiming at. We are in a strong cash position. We have ample funds to operate our business and a rock solid balance sheet with no debt. 
With that said, I'd like to make something very clear about cash collection. Our accounts receivable are and have always been tremendously secured. As our customer base is primarily composed of the largest and most successful companies in the world, there's very little risk of default and our history with these customers supports this. We have no issues collecting our receivables. Our customers fully understand the value they receive from our solutions and always pay to continue receiving that value. In fact, our over 90 days AR represents only 1.5% of our total receivable of which more than 50% was collected in the first half of January. 
Regarding the stock buyback. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for about $57.6 million. We will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
Q3 represents another good performance for Compuware. and with each successive quarter, we continue to see ample evidence that our strategy and the implementation of our strategy is working.
Via top line growth, the mounting success of our key growth drivers such as APM and Covisint, and the margin expansion in the services business, the consistent stability of our maintenance base or the improvement in our overall operating margin. The momentum we are experiencing across the organization is abundantly apparent. The bottom line is that Compuware is in fantastic shape and in prime position to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that we all know are there for the taking. Lisa?"

Then will have additional levers on the business that will drive topline revenue growth and margin expansion. Some of those levers include improved sales productivity. So I know that sounds like a general theme, but we measure that down to the individual. And our average productivity so far to date has gone up substantially per rep. There's still room for improvement and we'll see that growth continue in the fiscal year '12. First mile, we'll hit the market place and that is another lever. The CloudSleuth MSP program that will drive incremental revenue through all those partners that I talked about into the Gomez platform and then into the whole application delivery chain is another lever that will be incremental to our target trajectory we just talked about. The partners in channels numbers, we still fully expect especially because of success we've seen this year in its initial launch to come in and represent about 25% of our revenue in fiscal year '12. Obviously, the scale of that is much more topline based, and obviously not as much cost and our partners will win substantially from that consultancy capabilities and/or hardware capabilities around those. So we are looking at also some levers on the services side. I talked briefly about them. We are very encouraged about the ability to grow or improve our margin expansion as topline revenue grows. The only thing that would slow that down at all is that we have a Gomez platform that we still need to build out some additional infrastructure in Asia Pac and in South America to make sure that we are best in class in those geographies. obviously, that will have a return on investment but not the equal ratio that we'll see that growth in North America as an example. So that's how we're thinking about it. One of the comment if you'll allow me, the other thing is this business unit structure, look at about when we want to add cost of programs or anything else, there will be a counterbalance to that based upon an ROI inside the company. The business unit will basically sign off on to make sure that we are all agreeing and their internal controls to measure and drive on a return investment on new investments that we want to make whether it be sales tools, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be in people, what have you. And I think that will increase our efficiency and discipline and that ultimately would be in the bottom line next year also."

On the other side, on the sales side, on the healthcare piece, I think we've got great coverage. And I know they're going crazy with the activity, but we also have some great, great partners there that are helping of the scale that including AT&T, including the American Medical Association and a number of other solution partners that are pulling us in and vice versa.

There's typically add-on opportunities and there are two ways or characteristic the cross-selling activity of the two groups. It has been light but where it has happened, it has been remarkably successful. So the win rate is very high but the cross-selling activity has not been high enough. One of the ways in which we're working on solving that is through this business unit structure basically what will have an integrated sales organization with the ability to have everything in their kitbag, and a very well-defined maturity model so it will be in the best interest of our customers to basically take them from where they are at today and evolve them in the way best in class application performance management company. And you'll start to hear less about Gomez and Vantage and more about the overall APM business unit, growth in sales and profitability moving forward.

Our growth rates value proposition footprint and our strategy moving forward, meaning we're just going to keep on innovating, innovating, innovating.

We have a three-year strategy in our APM business and the first, besides the ease of that we're adding all the time. The next major footprint that we will add is sort of business intelligence layer. A lot of people are talking business intelligence and telling us not been APM but in other areas of IT. The challenge is, a lot of companies don't have access to data so that's what they struggle with. We have access to a massive amount of data that comes in that they can provide very quick and value based business intelligence. But it takes incredibly complex algorithms and analytics and engines and people, very bright people to be able to apply those. With Baz, we were looking at some of the other productive analytics companies before we picked up both of the ones we're looking at $100 million. Baz was a non-material cost mostly because from Amir market share perspective, but their technology capability, we believe was as good as any of the others. And so uniquely applying predictive analytics and business intelligence on top of this wealth of information we're grabbing around the world, getting doubted that individual application components, so we can start to show not just where the applications are performing poorly but what elements from third parties or CDMs partners that are starting to have an impact on the end map is going to be critical. The next big push that we'll have and I'm not going to say as a much about the competitive reasons what we're calling active performance management. Certainly, we are continuing to look and analyze that marketplace to see if anything makes sense. There is absolutely nothing imminent. The only other thing that I'll tell you is that our board is very anxious to get to a position of a 40% market share of a $6 billion to $7 billion addressable market as predicted by the analyst by 2013. You can do the math, that's a tremendous amount of growth and in the next two years. And we are certainly not going to get there completely organically. So we'll be careful, will take a look at everything when we see great value out there like we did with Baz. And we'll run at it but nothing imminent right now."

Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter, increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year.

Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter, increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3's year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The highlights for the quarter include strong performances in our Mainframe, Covisint and Professional Services business. 
Compuware is now consistently achieving business success. We've met or exceeded consensus analysts' expectations for EPS for six straight quarters. We're vigilantly managing our margins, ensuring profitability in our mature businesses. Simultaneously, we're investing in the businesses that will drive Compuware's breakout growth, both in revenues and in earnings in the years ahead. 
For application performance management, we find ourselves with the best-in-class solution in a high-growth category. Most companies today are investing in strategic web-based apps due to the promise of top line revenue growth, improved market share and brand awareness. This dramatic increase in web-based applications, cloud computing, mobile devices and virtualization all drive a need for greater visibility of application performance inside and outside the firewall. 
Compuware is the only solution to this problem that offers a single dashboard with deep dive analytics across the entire application delivery chain, giving executives and practitioners critical performance information. These capabilities create significant separation from our competitors. Furthermore, we have the ability to measure the app's performance based upon the end user experience, which is the point where IT delivers value to the business. This is the only meaningful way of solving the problem and only Compuware can do it. Our intention is to further this competitive gap with more disruptive, value-based capabilities on the coming quarters. 
This fiscal year, we've gained well over 400 new application performance management customers, a rapid rate of market penetration that I expect to increase.
Gomez has become one of the most important solutions in the Internet business. Q3 was the best bookings quarter in Gomez' history, with 31% year-over-year bookings growth on a pro forma basis to more than $28 million. Gomez also delivered nearly 26% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis to $18 million. We added 133 net new Gomez customers in Q3. We continue to mature our ability to sell and deliver Gomez internationally. In Q3, we added a number of cornerstone international customers including a leading sports apparel brand, the world's second largest telecom company and one of the world's most important data protection firms. Our infrastructure expansion will continue outside of North America, which will further bolster our growth in coming quarters.
Total APM revenues made up of Gomez and Vantage were strong year-over-year, in fact, up 34% on a GAAP basis. Vantage license fees and maintenance were both up year-over-year and sequentially but just short of our goal due to nothing more than a few deals slipping at the end of the quarter. As a result, our overall Q4 pipeline for Vantage is stronger than we expected. 
In Q3, we also strengthened our competitive positioning in APM with our acquisition of BEZ Systems. This is a great example of gaining competitive advantage faster and cheaper than we could build it. For non-material costs, this advanced analytics engine will help us win more business through predictive monitoring and business analytics on top of the platform. This capability is a key part of our three-year road map and will start to have a revenue impact in Q2 of fiscal year '12. 
In Q3, we also executed a controlled launch of First Mile, which is going as well as any launch in Compuware history. As a reminder, First Mile is a pre-configured appliance with the integrated Gomez and Vantage solution that is up running within minutes. This controlled launch is giving us the information and positive feedback we need to execute flawlessly on a broader solution launch. We will launch a vertical industry release of First Mile next week for the retail industry, and move forward with specific solutions for other industry segments in the months ahead. 
We believe First Mile provides us with the best opportunity to become the global standard for APM in the years to come. The overall solution value and time to achieve that value are unprecedented in the industry and certainly can't be matched through handshake partnerships. Furthermore, the rate of innovation on this fast-paced platform will allow our customers to achieve best-in-class capabilities rapidly. 
Our Covisint solution for secured collaboration proves an outstanding Q3, featuring nearly 33% of revenue growth. This growth was driven largely by Healthcare revenue, which increased more than 42% in the quarter. Our Healthcare segment produced several notable wins including Northeastern Pennsylvania Health Information Exchange, the Vermont Blueprint for Health initiative, and we just recently announced the Greater Tulsa Health Association (sic) [Access] Network. 
We're well on track to having four state health information exchanges by the end of the year, obviously, conditional timing on the state-based decisions, with additional growth coming from hospitals, medical associations and physician practices. Our quality of care and outcome-based solutions are making a substantial difference in our competitive positioning. 
In Q4, a larger portion of Covisint's recognized revenue will be driven by patient quality reporting initiative. Covisint is a leading submitter of such data to Medicaid, and our capacity for supporting outcomes-based care will propel future increases in revenue.
The manufacturing vertical for Covisint is showing renewed vigor with a more than 27% jump in revenue year-over-year. We're also establishing a market leadership position in the oil and gas vertical, a position we intend to solidify in the coming quarters. 
In Q3, Covisint backlog grew to nearly $140 million. Bottom line, the Covisint business is growing aggressively with no end in sight. Our biggest objective is to scale thoughtfully without compromising one bit of quality. Partners remain a critical component of our strategy, with their ability to drive incremental revenue and brand awareness at a lower cost of sales. Both Cisco and Accenture continue to produce meaningful revenue as we gear up to drive greater market opportunities for all of our partners. Our continued focus on managed service providers in the cloud and outsources are paying off as we close two multi-year commitments this quarter with global service providers. 
Partners have brought us in the business with global brands like the Olympics games, Bombardier and AstraZeneca. Our partner focus also extends our capacity for executing in high growth markets. Working with companies like Hitachi, Verizon, AT&T, ATL and Accenture were significantly increasing our footprint in Brazil, India and China. During fiscal year '12, through these partners in Asia Pac and Europe, we'll launch offerings for cloud computing that feature Compuware solutions.
We are also having success with our CloudSleuth.net performance portal where we now have 14 managed service providers onboard and another 10 that are currently being onboarded. This initiative will not only drive incremental revenues but will expand our thought leadership position. 
Compuware's Mainframe solutions had a solid Q3 with a nearly 34% increase in license fees year-over-year. We've seen some uptick from the z10 release that I would expect to continue over the coming years. Renewals remain well over 90% as the value we delivered continues to be validated by the marketplace. Reducing mainframe operating cost, improving program productivity and a transitioning labor force remained key market drivers for these very important solutions. The environment remains competitive, but we are the market leaders in the productivity tools category, and as such, continue to win.
Compuware's Professional Services business is another positive turnaround story. For yet another quarter, the business produced improved margins year-over-year and grew both revenues and margins sequentially. We have achieved what we expected to be our Q4 goal in Q3 with a stated goal of 15% margin, with a core professional services margin of 17%, excluding the Solution Delivery group. Our focus on differentiated services offerings will allow us to grow that margin even more next year. 
Our Solution Delivery group is showing consistent improvement, which is the key to further revenue and margin expansion of our overall services numbers. Uniface continues to drive solid margins and improve license revenue growth. Uniface's ability to delivery rich Internet two-tier and cloud applications makes it the logical choice as development cycles decrease and environments become much more Internet-based.
Our Changepoint results in Q3 were not as strong as we had anticipated. Our more focused go-to market approach for the solution has great promise, and Changepoint revenue appears to be rebounding nicely this quarter in Q4.
Just a quick word around the next step in the company's organizational structure. Starting in April, Compuware will be organized around solution business units. This structure will maximize operational visibility for management and investors while increasing focus, agility, customer responsiveness and win rates for every line of business. We'll tell you much more about these plans at our Q4 conference call.
Our strategy is working, and we will continue to strive to deliver market-leading solutions with even greater improvement in operational efficiencies. As we've discussed for fiscal year '12, there are many levers that will drive Compuware's topline growth and margin expansion. Our market-leading matured businesses are profitable and stable, our SaaS solutions are two of the fastest-growing in the world. Our growth drivers are realizing their potential of moving the positions of dominance in their over $1 billion categories. 
The drive to capitalize our competitive advantage is what keeps us up at night. We have the opportunity to build Compuware APM to a $2 billion, 40% margin business. Covisint is already the name brand solution for securely sharing information and apps in complex industries. With Covisint's market leadership established, we'll focus on taking advantage of the rejuvenation of the manufacturing industry and the billions of dollars flowing into healthcare. 
Meanwhile, we'll continue to execute on the fundamentals. We need to meet our Q4 and full year goals. We're comfortable with the consensus analysts' estimates for Q4 and the full year. As always, there is work to be done in hitting our Q4 target and in completing a strong growth plan for fiscal year '12. We have the remarkable people and the solutions to make it happen. Now that we've achieved consistency in growth, our focus is to accelerate that growth.

Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continue to achieve consistent results. This quarter's results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year topline revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20%",565,"Thanks, Bob. Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continue to achieve consistent results. This quarter's results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year topline revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20%, up from 15.7% from the year ago period and 18% last quarter. Our efforts to grow the business while keeping costs in line continue to show results. 
In terms of cost, total operating expenses for the quarter came in at $197 million within our stated guidance of $195 million to $200 million. We have a firm grasp on expense management across the company with the singular focus on impactful investment in those areas that presents the greatest promise. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%. The lower than anticipated tax rate for this quarter is primarily attributable to the passage of tax legislations in December that included, among other things, the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credit back to January 1, 2010. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to come in at 36%.
For the first nine months of fiscal year '11, operating cash flow was $35.8 million. Obviously, we expected cash flow to be higher at this point in the year, and given the importance of timing in the equation, we believe cash flow from operations will be between $175 million and $200 million for the year. While this is a disappointment, I don't believe it is a cause for concern. Numerous factors impact operating cash, including when a deal closes in the quarter, payment options and the term of the transaction. Given where we are at, the $175 million is certainly attainable while the $200 million is still possible and definitely the target we are aiming at. 
We are in a strong cash position. We have ample funds to operate our business and a rock solid balance sheet with no debt. With that said, I'd like to make something very clear about our cash collection. Our accounts receivable are and have always been tremendously secure. As our customer base is primarily composed of the largest and most successful companies in the world, there is very little risk of default, and our history with these customers supports this. We have no issues collecting our receivables. Our customers fully understand the value they receive from our solutions and always pay to continue receiving that value. In fact, our over 90 days AR represents only 1.5% of our total receivables of which more than 50% was collected in the first half of January. 
Regarding the stock buyback. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for about $57.6 million. We will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
Q3 represents another good performance for Compuware. And with each successive quarter, we continue to see ample evidence that our strategy and the implementation of our strategy is working. Be it top line growth, the mounting success of our key growth drivers such as APM and Covisint, and margin expansion in the services business, the consistent stability of our maintenance base or the improvement in our overall operating margin, the momentum we are experiencing across the organization is abundantly apparent. 
The bottom line is that Compuware is in fantastic shape and in prime position to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that we all know are there for the taking. Lisa?"

So we have a trajectory of growth with each of our solution lines right now. We'll extend that trajectory in the fiscal year '12. Then we have additional levers on the business that will drive topline revenue growth and margin expansion. Some of those levers include improved sales productivity. So I know that sounds like a general theme, but we measure that down to the individual. And our average productivity so far to date has gone up substantially per rep. There's still room for improvement, and we'll see that growth continue in fiscal year '12. First Mile will hit the market place and that is another lever. The CloudSleuth MSP program that will drive incremental revenue through all those partners that I talked about through CloudSleuth into the Gomez platform and then into the whole application delivery chain is another lever that will be incremental to the trajectory that we just talked about. The partners in channels numbers, we still fully expect, especially because of the success we've seen this year in its initial launch, to come in and represent about 25% of our revenue in fiscal year '12. Obviously, the scale of that is much more topline based and obviously not as much cost, and our partners will win substantially from that because they'll have services consultancy capabilities and/or hardware capabilities around those. So we're looking at also some levers on the services side. I talked briefly about them. We are very encouraged about the ability to grow or improve our margin expansion as topline revenue grows. The only thing that would slow that down at all is that we have a Gomez platform that we still need to build out some additional infrastructure in Asia Pac and in South America to make sure that we are best in class in those geographies. Obviously, that will have a return on investment but not the equal ratio that we'd see in that growth in North America as an example. So that's how we're thinking about it. One other comment, if you'll allow me, the other thing is this business unit structure, I'll comment a little about, when we want to add cost or programs or anything else, there will be a counterbalance to that, that's based upon an ROI inside the company, that the business unit will basically sign off on to make sure that we're all agreeing and that there are internal controls to measure and drive any return on investment on new investments that we want to make, whether it be sales tools, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be in people, what have you.

We've got a three-year strategy in our APM business. And the first, besides all the ease of use stuff, more -- that kind of stuff that we're adding all the time, the next major footprint that we will add is sort of business intelligence layer. Now a lot of people are talking business intelligence, predictive analytics. Not in APM but in other areas of IT. The challenge is, a lot of these companies don't have access to the data, so that's what they struggle with. We have access to massive amounts of data that comes in that can provide very quick and value-based business intelligence but it takes incredibly complex algorithms and analytics and engines and people, very bright people, to be able to apply those. With BEZ, we were looking at some of the other predictive analytics companies before we picked up BEZ, both the ones we were looking at got picked up for $100 million. BEZ was a non-material cost mostly because haven't really gotten going from a market share perspective, but their technology capability, we believe, was as good as any of the others. And so uniquely applying predictive analytics and business intelligence on top of this wealth of information we're grabbing from around the world, getting down into the individual application components, so we can start to show not just where the applications are performing poorly but what elements from third parties or CDM ISPs or partners that are starting to have an impact on the end map [ph] is going to be critical. The next big push that we'll have, and I'm not going to say much about it for competitive reasons, is what we're calling active performance management. Certainly, we're continuing to look and analyze that marketplace to see if anything makes sense. There is absolutely nothing imminent. The only other thing that I'll tell you is that our board is very anxious to get to a position of a 40% market share of a $6 billion to $7 billion addressable market as predicted by the analyst by 2013. You can do the math. That's a tremendous amount of growth in the next two years. And we're certainly not going to get there completely organically. So we'll be careful. We'll take a look at everything. When we see great value out there like we did with BEZ, we'll run at it. But nothing imminent right now."

Compuware earned $0.15 per share in Q3. For six consecutive quarters Compuware meet or beat analyst consensus estimates for EPS. EPS jumped 36.4% year-over-year, total revenues increased 7.5% year-over-year, total APM revenues reached $56.1 million, up 34% on a GAAP basis year-over-year.
Covisint revenues grew 32.8% year-over-year to $14.4 million. Non-mainframe solutions revenue up 22.5% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Professional services segment contribution margins reaches 12.5%. Compuware Corporation, a technology performance company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended December 31.
Compuware reports third quarter revenues of $247 million up 7.5% from $229.9 million in Q3 last year. Third quarter earnings per share were $0.15 based upon $225.2 million shares outstanding, up 36.4% from $0.11 based on 231.1 million shares outstanding in Q3 last year.
Third quarter net income was $34 million, up 39.3% from $24.4 million in Q3 last year.
During the company’s third quarter, software license fees were $60.2 million, up 15.6% from $52 million in Q3 last year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $124.2 million in the third quarter up 5.6% from $117.6 million in Q3 last year.
Revenue from professional services in the third quarter was $62.7 million, up 4.1% from $60.3 million in Q3 last year.

Compuware delivered another strong on target quarter increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3’s year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The highlights for the quarter include strong performances in our mainframe, Covisint and professional services business.
Compuware is now consistently achieving business success. We have met or exceeded consensus analyst expectations for EPS for 6 straight quarters; we are vigilantly managing our margins and showing profitability in our mature businesses. Simultaneously we are investing in the businesses that will drive Compuware’s breakout growth both in revenue and in earnings in the years ahead.
For application performance management, we find ourselves with the best in class solution in a high-growth category. Most companies today are investing in strategic web-based apps due to the promise of top line revenue growth, improved market share and brand awareness. This dramatic increase in Web-based applications, Cloud computing, multi-devices and virtualization all drive the need for greater visibility of application performance inside and outside the firewall.
Compuware has the only solution to this problem and offers a single dashboard with deep dive analytics across the entire application delivery and chain giving executives and practitioners critical performance information. This capability has created significant separation from our competitors. Furthermore, we have the ability to measure the app’s performance based upon the end-user experience, which is the point where IT delivers value to the business.
This is the only meaningful way of solving the problem and only Compuware can do it. Our intention is to further this competitive gap with more disruptive value based capabilities in the coming quarters. This fiscal year we have gained well over 400 new application performance management customers, a rapid rate of market penetration that I expect to increase.
Gomez has become one of the most important solutions in the Internet business. Q3 was the best bookings quarter in Gomez’s history with 31% year-over-year bookings growth on a pro forma basis to more than $28 million. Gomez also delivered nearly 26% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis to $18 million. We added 133 net new Gomez customers in Q3.
We continue to mature our ability to sell and deliver Gomez internationally. In Q3 we added a number of cornerstone international customers including a leading sports apparel brand, the world’s second largest telecom company, and one of the world’s most important data protection firms. Our infrastructure expansion will continue outside of North America, which will further bolster our growth in coming quarters.
Total APM revenues, made up of Gomez and Vantage were strong year-over-year, in fact up 34% on a GAAP basis. Vantage license fees and maintenance were both up year-over-year and sequentially, but just short of our goals due to nothing more than a few deals slipping at the end of the quarter. As a result, our overall Q4 pipeline for Vantage is stronger than we expected.
In Q3 we also strengthened our competitive position in APM with our acquisition of BEZ Systems. This is a great example of gaining competitive advantage faster and cheaper than we could build it. For nonmaterial cost, this advanced analytics engine will help us win more business through predicted monitoring and business analytics on top of the platform.
This capability is a key part of our three year road map and will start to have a revenue impact in Q2 of fiscal year ’12. In Q3 we also expected a controlled launch - executed a controlled launch of First Mile, which is going as well as any launch in Compuware history. As a reminder, First Mile is a preconfigured appliance with the integrated Gomez and Vantage solutions that is up and running within minutes.
This controlled launch is giving us the information and positive feedback we need to execute flawlessly on the broader solution launch. We will launch a vertical industry release of First Mile next week for the retail industry, and move forward with specific solutions for other segments in the months ahead. We believe First Mile provides us with the best opportunity to become the global standard for APM in the years to come.
The overall solution value and time to achieve that value are unprecedented in the industry and certainly can’t be matched through handshake partnerships. Furthermore, the rate of innovation on the SaaS platform will allow our customers to achieve best in class capabilities rapidly.
Our Covisint solution for secured collaboration produced an outstanding Q3 featuring nearly 33% revenue growth. This growth was driven largely by healthcare revenue, which increased more than 42% in the quarter. Our healthcare segment produced several notable wins including Northeastern Pennsylvania Health Information Exchange, the Vermont Blueprint for Health initiative, and we have just recently announced the Greater Tulsa Health Association Network.
We are well on track to having four state health information exchanges by the end of the year. Obviously conditional timing on the state based decisions with additional growth coming from hospitals, medical associations and physician practices. Our quality of care and outcome based solutions are making a substantial difference in our competitive positioning.
In Q4, a larger portion of Covisint’s recognized revenue will be driven by patient quality reporting initiate. Covisint is a leading submitter of such data to Medicaid and our capacity for supporting outcomes based care will propel future increases in revenue. The manufacturing vertical to Covisint is showing renewed vigor with more than 27% jump in revenue year-over-year. We’re also establishing a market leadership position in the oil and gas vertical, a position we intend to solidify in the coming quarters.
In Q3, Covisint backlog grew to nearly $140 million. Bottom line, the Covisint business is growing aggressively with no end in sight. Our biggest objective is to scale thoughtfully without compromising one bit of quality.
Partners remain a critical component of our strategy with their ability to drive incremental revenue and brand awareness at a lower cost of sales. Both Cisco and Accenture continue to produce meaningful revenues, we gear up to drive greater market opportunities for all of our partners.
Our continued focus on managed service providers in the cloud and outsources are paying off as we close two multi-year commitments this quarter with global service providers. Parties who have brought us in the business with global brands like the Olympic Games, Bombardier and AstraZeneca. Our partner focus also extends our capacity for executing in high-growth markets.
Working with companies like Hitachi, Verizon, AT&T, HCL, and Accenture we are significantly increasing our footprint in Brazil, India and China. During fiscal year ’12 through these partners in Asia Pac and in Europe, we will launch offerings for cloud computing that feature Compuware solutions.
We’re also having success with our CloudSleuth.net performance portal, where we now have 14 managed service providers on board, and another 10 that are currently being onboarded. This initiative will not only drive incremental revenues, but will expand our thought leadership position.
Compuware mainframe solutions had a solid Q3 with a nearly 34% increase in license fees year-over-year. We have seen some uptick from the z10 [ph] release that I will expect to continue over the coming years. Renewables remain well over 90% of the value we deliver continues to be validated by the marketplace. Reducing mainframe operating cost, improving program of productivity, a transitioning labor force remain key market drivers for these very important solutions. The environment remains competitive, but we are the market leaders in the productivity tools category and as such continue to win.
Compuware’s professional services business is another positive turnaround story. We had another quarter the business produced improved margins year-over-year and grew both revenues and margins sequentially. We have achieved what we expected to be our Q4 goal in Q3 with the stated goal of 15% margin, with a core professional services margin of 17%, excluding the solution delivery group.
Our focus on differentiated services offerings will allow us to grow that margin even more next year. Our solution delivery group is showing consistent improvement, which is the key to further revenue and margin expansion of our overall services numbers.
Uniface continues to provide solid margins and improved license revenue growth. Uniface’s ability to deliver rich Internet, two-tier and cloud applications makes it a logical choice as development cycles decrease and environments become much more Internet based.
Our Changepoint results in Q3 were not as strong as we had anticipated. Our more focused go to market approach for the solution has great promise, and Changepoint
Revenue appears to be rebounding nicely this quarter in Q4. Just a quick word around the next step in the company’s organizational structure.
Starting in April, Compuware will be organized around solution business units. This structure will maximize operational visibility for management and investors, while increasing focus, agility, customer responsiveness and win rates for every line of business. We will tell you much more about these plans on our Q4 conference call.
Our strategy is working, and we will continue to strive to deliver market leading solutions with even greater improvement in operational efficiencies. As we have discussed for fiscal year 12, there are many levers that will drive Compuware’s top line growth and margin expansion. Our market leading matured businesses are profitable and stable; our SaaS solutions are two of the fastest growing in the world.
Our growth drivers are realizing their potential and moving to positions of dominance in their over $1 billion categories. The drive to capitalize our competitive advantage is what keeps us up at night. We have the opportunity to build Compuware APM to a $2 billion 40% margin business. Covisint is already the name brand solution for securely sharing information and apps in complex industries.
With Covisint’s market leadership established, we are focused on taking advantage of rejuvenation of the manufacturing industry and the billions of dollars flowing in healthcare. Meanwhile, we will continue to execute on the fundamentals. We need to meet our Q4 and full year goals. We’re comfortable with the consensus analyst estimates for Q4 and the full year.
As always, there is work to be done in hitting our Q4 targets and in completing a strong growth plan for fiscal year ’12. We have the remarkable people and the solutions to make it happen. Now that we have achieved consistency in growth, our focus is to accelerate that growth. Laura.

Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to",566,"Thanks Bob. Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continued to achieve consistent results. This quarter’s results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year top line revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20% up from 15.7% in the year ago period, and 18% last quarter. Our efforts to grow the business while keeping costs in-line continue to show results.
In terms of cost, total operating expenses for the quarter came in at $197 million, within our stated guidance of $195 million to $200 million. We have a firm grip on expense management across the company with a singular focus on [ph] investment in those areas that present the greatest promise.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%. The lower than anticipated tax rate for this quarter is primarily attributable to the passage of tax legislation in December that included among other things a retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credits back to January 1, 2010. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to come in at 36%.
For the first nine months of fiscal year ‘11, operating cash flow was $35.8 million. Obviously we expected cash flow to be higher at this point in the year and given the importance of timing and the equation, we believe cash flow from operations will be between $175 billion and $200 billion [ph] for the year. While this is a disappointment, I don’t believe it is a cause for concern. Numerous factors impact operating cash, including when a deal closes in the quarter, payment options, and the term of the transaction.
Given where we are at the $175 million is certainly attainable, while the $200 million is still possible and definitely the target we are aiming at. We are in a strong cash position. We have ample funds to operate our business and a rock solid balance sheet with no debt.
With that said, I would like to make something very clear about our cash collection. Our accounts receivable are and have always been tremendously secure. As our customer base is primarily composed of the largest and most successful companies in the world, there is very little risk of default, and our history with these customers supports this. We have no issues collecting our receivables.
Our customers fully understand the value they receive from our solutions and always pay to continue receiving that value. In fact, our over 90 days AR represents only 1.5% of our total receivables of which more than 50% was collected in the first half of January.
Regarding the stock buyback, in Q2 we repurchased 5.4 million shares for about $57.6 million. We will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow. Q3 represents another good performance for Compuware, and with each successive quarter we continue to see ample evidence that our strategy and the implementation of our strategy is working, be it top line growth, the mounting success of our key growth drivers such as APM and Covisint, and margin expansion in the services business, the consistent stability of our maintenance base or the improvement in their overall operating margins, the momentum we are experiencing across the organization is abundantly apparent.
The bottom line is that Compuware is in fantastic shape and in prime position to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that we all now is there for the taking. Lisa.

So the capacity deals are tough because we don't always know and full insight into the timing, when these MIPS come online.

So we have a trajectory of growth with each of our solution lines right now. We'll extend that trajectory in the fiscal year '12. Then we have additional levers on the business that will drive top line revenue growth and margin expansion. Some of those levers include improved sales productivity. So I know that sounds like a general theme, but we measure that down to the individual and our average productivity so far to-date has gone up substantially per rep.
There is still room for improvement and we'll see that growth continue in fiscal year '12. First Mile will hit the marketplace and that is another lever. The CloudSleuth MSP program that will drive incremental revenue through those - all those partners that I talked about through CloudSleuth into the Gomez platform, and then into the whole application delivery chain is another lever that will be incremental to the trajectory that we just talked about. The partners and channels numbers we still fully expect especially because of the success we've seen this year in its initial launch to come in and represent about 25% of our revenue in the fiscal year '12.
Obviously the scale of that is much more top line based and obviously not as much cost, and our partners will win substantially from that because they will add services consultancy capabilities and/or hardware capabilities around those. So we're looking at also some levers on the services side. I talked briefly about them. We are very encouraged about the ability to grow or improve our margin expansion as top line revenue grows. The only thing that would slow that down at all is that we have a Gomez platform that we still need to build out some additional infrastructure in Asia-Pac and in South America to make sure that we are best-in-class in those geographies.
Obviously, that will have a return on investment, but not the equal ratio that we would see in that growth in North America as an example. So that’s how we are thinking about it. One other comment, if you will allow me, the other thing is this business unit structure, I will comment a little bit about. When we want to add costs or programs or anything else, there will be a counterbalance to that based upon ROI inside the company. The business unit will basically sign off on to make sure that we are all agreeing in their internal controls to measure and drive any return on investment on new investments that we want to make, whether it be sales tools, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be in people, what have you, and I think that will increase our efficiency and discipline, and that ultimately will hit the bottom line next year also.

Let me talk about BEZ real quickly, so you can understand how that fits in. So we’ve got a three-year strategy in our APM business, and the first besides all the ease-of-use stuff, more analytic - that kind of stuff that we are adding all the time. The next major footprint that we will add is the business intelligence layer. Now, a lot of people are talking business intelligence predictive analytics, not in APM but in other areas of IT. The challenge is a lot of these companies don’t have access to the data. So that’s what they struggle with. We have access to massive amounts of data that comes in that it can provide very quick and value-based business intelligence, but it takes incredibly complex algorithms and analytics and engines and people, very bright people to be able to apply those.
With BEZ, and we were looking at some of the other predictive analytics companies before we picked up BEZ, both the ones we’re looking at got picked up for $100 million. BEZ was a non-material cost, mostly because they hadn’t really gotten going from a market share perspective, but their technology capability we believe was as good as any of the others. And so uniquely applying predictive analytics and business intelligence on top of this wealth of information we're grabbing from around the world, getting down into the individual application components, so we can start to show not just where the applications are performing poorly, but what elements from third parties or CDNs, ISPs, or partners that are starting to have an impact on the end app is going to be critical.
The next big push that we'll have and I'm not going to say much about it for competitive reasons is what we're calling active performance management. Certainly, we're continuing to look and analyze that marketplace to see if anything makes sense. There is absolutely nothing imminent. The only other thing I'll tell you is that our board is very anxious to get to a position of a 40% market share of a $6 billion to $7 billion addressable market as predicted by the analyst by 2013. You can do the math. That's a tremendous amount of growth, and - in the next two years and we're certainly not going to get there completely organically, so we'll be careful. We'll take a look at everything when we see great value out there like we did with BEZ. We'll run at it, but nothing imminent right now.

Compuware earned $0.15 per share in Q3. For six consecutive quarters, Compuware meets or beats analyst consensus estimates for EPS. EPS jumped 36.4% year-over-year. Total revenues increased 7.5% year-over-year. Total APM revenues reached $56.1 million, up 34% on a GAAP basis, year-over-year. Covisint revenues grew 32.8% year-over-year to $14.4 million. Non-Mainframe solutions revenue up 22.5% on a GAAP basis, year-over-year. Professional Services segment contribution margin reaches 15%. 
Compuware Corporation, the technology-performance company, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended December 31. Compuware reports third quarter revenues of $247 million, up 7.5% from $229.9 million in Q3 last year. Third quarter earnings per share were $0.15 based upon 225.2 million shares outstanding, up 36.4% from $0.11 based on 231.1 million shares outstanding in Q3 last year.
Third quarter net income was $34 million, up 39.3% from $24.4 million in Q3 last year. During the company's third quarter, software license fees were $60.2 million, up 15.6% from $52 million in Q3 last year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $124.2 million in the third quarter, up 5.6% from $117.6 million in Q3 last year. Revenue from Professional Services in the third quarter was $62.7 million, up 4.1% from $60.3 million in Q3 last year.

Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter, increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year.

Compuware delivered another solid on target quarter, increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3's year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The highlights for the quarter include strong performances in our Mainframe, Covisint and Professional Services business. 
Compuware is now consistently achieving business success. We've met or exceeded consensus analysts' expectations for EPS for six straight quarters. We're vigilantly managing our margins, ensuring profitability in our mature businesses. Simultaneously, we're investing in the businesses that will drive Compuware's breakout growth, both in revenues and in earnings in the years ahead. 
For application performance management, we find ourselves with the best-in-class solution in a high-growth category. Most companies today are investing in strategic web-based apps due to the promise of top line revenue growth, improved market share and brand awareness. This dramatic increase in web-based applications, cloud computing, mobile devices and virtualization all drive a need for greater visibility of application performance inside and outside the firewall. 
Compuware is the only solution to this problem that offers a single dashboard with deep dive analytics across the entire application delivery chain, giving executives and practitioners critical performance information. These capabilities create significant separation from our competitors. Furthermore, we have the ability to measure the app's performance based upon the end user experience, which is the point where IT delivers value to the business. This is the only meaningful way of solving the problem and only Compuware can do it. Our intention is to further this competitive gap with more disruptive, value-based capabilities on the coming quarters. 
This fiscal year, we've gained well over 400 new application performance management customers, a rapid rate of market penetration that I expect to increase.
Gomez has become one of the most important solutions in the Internet business. Q3 was the best bookings quarter in Gomez' history, with 31% year-over-year bookings growth on a pro forma basis to more than $28 million. Gomez also delivered nearly 26% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis to $18 million. We added 133 net new Gomez customers in Q3. We continue to mature our ability to sell and deliver Gomez internationally. In Q3, we added a number of cornerstone international customers including a leading sports apparel brand, the world's second largest telecom company and one of the world's most important data protection firms. Our infrastructure expansion will continue outside of North America, which will further bolster our growth in coming quarters.
Total APM revenues made up of Gomez and Vantage were strong year-over-year, in fact, up 34% on a GAAP basis. Vantage license fees and maintenance were both up year-over-year and sequentially but just short of our goal due to nothing more than a few deals slipping at the end of the quarter. As a result, our overall Q4 pipeline for Vantage is stronger than we expected. 
In Q3, we also strengthened our competitive positioning in APM with our acquisition of BEZ Systems. This is a great example of gaining competitive advantage faster and cheaper than we could build it. For non-material costs, this advanced analytics engine will help us win more business through predictive monitoring and business analytics on top of the platform. This capability is a key part of our three-year road map and will start to have a revenue impact in Q2 of fiscal year '12. 
In Q3, we also executed a controlled launch of First Mile, which is going as well as any launch in Compuware history. As a reminder, First Mile is a pre-configured appliance with the integrated Gomez and Vantage solution that is up running within minutes. This controlled launch is giving us the information and positive feedback we need to execute flawlessly on a broader solution launch. We will launch a vertical industry release of First Mile next week for the retail industry, and move forward with specific solutions for other industry segments in the months ahead. 
We believe First Mile provides us with the best opportunity to become the global standard for APM in the years to come. The overall solution value and time to achieve that value are unprecedented in the industry and certainly can't be matched through handshake partnerships. Furthermore, the rate of innovation on this fast-paced platform will allow our customers to achieve best-in-class capabilities rapidly. 
Our Covisint solution for secured collaboration proves an outstanding Q3, featuring nearly 33% of revenue growth. This growth was driven largely by Healthcare revenue, which increased more than 42% in the quarter. Our Healthcare segment produced several notable wins including Northeastern Pennsylvania Health Information Exchange, the Vermont Blueprint for Health initiative, and we just recently announced the Greater Tulsa Health Association (sic) [Access] Network. 
We're well on track to having four state health information exchanges by the end of the year, obviously, conditional timing on the state-based decisions, with additional growth coming from hospitals, medical associations and physician practices. Our quality of care and outcome-based solutions are making a substantial difference in our competitive positioning. 
In Q4, a larger portion of Covisint's recognized revenue will be driven by patient quality reporting initiative. Covisint is a leading submitter of such data to Medicaid, and our capacity for supporting outcomes-based care will propel future increases in revenue.
The manufacturing vertical for Covisint is showing renewed vigor with a more than 27% jump in revenue year-over-year. We're also establishing a market leadership position in the oil and gas vertical, a position we intend to solidify in the coming quarters. 
In Q3, Covisint backlog grew to nearly $140 million. Bottom line, the Covisint business is growing aggressively with no end in sight. Our biggest objective is to scale thoughtfully without compromising one bit of quality. Partners remain a critical component of our strategy, with their ability to drive incremental revenue and brand awareness at a lower cost of sales. Both Cisco and Accenture continue to produce meaningful revenue as we gear up to drive greater market opportunities for all of our partners. Our continued focus on managed service providers in the cloud and outsources are paying off as we close two multi-year commitments this quarter with global service providers. 
Partners have brought us in the business with global brands like the Olympics games, Bombardier and AstraZeneca. Our partner focus also extends our capacity for executing in high growth markets. Working with companies like Hitachi, Verizon, AT&T, ATL and Accenture were significantly increasing our footprint in Brazil, India and China. During fiscal year '12, through these partners in Asia Pac and Europe, we'll launch offerings for cloud computing that feature Compuware solutions.
We are also having success with our CloudSleuth.net performance portal where we now have 14 managed service providers onboard and another 10 that are currently being onboarded. This initiative will not only drive incremental revenues but will expand our thought leadership position. 
Compuware's Mainframe solutions had a solid Q3 with a nearly 34% increase in license fees year-over-year. We've seen some uptick from the z10 release that I would expect to continue over the coming years. Renewals remain well over 90% as the value we delivered continues to be validated by the marketplace. Reducing mainframe operating cost, improving program productivity and a transitioning labor force remained key market drivers for these very important solutions. The environment remains competitive, but we are the market leaders in the productivity tools category, and as such, continue to win.
Compuware's Professional Services business is another positive turnaround story. For yet another quarter, the business produced improved margins year-over-year and grew both revenues and margins sequentially. We have achieved what we expected to be our Q4 goal in Q3 with a stated goal of 15% margin, with a core professional services margin of 17%, excluding the Solution Delivery group. Our focus on differentiated services offerings will allow us to grow that margin even more next year. 
Our Solution Delivery group is showing consistent improvement, which is the key to further revenue and margin expansion of our overall services numbers. Uniface continues to drive solid margins and improve license revenue growth. Uniface's ability to delivery rich Internet two-tier and cloud applications makes it the logical choice as development cycles decrease and environments become much more Internet-based.
Our Changepoint results in Q3 were not as strong as we had anticipated. Our more focused go-to market approach for the solution has great promise, and Changepoint revenue appears to be rebounding nicely this quarter in Q4.
Just a quick word around the next step in the company's organizational structure. Starting in April, Compuware will be organized around solution business units. This structure will maximize operational visibility for management and investors while increasing focus, agility, customer responsiveness and win rates for every line of business. We'll tell you much more about these plans at our Q4 conference call.
Our strategy is working, and we will continue to strive to deliver market-leading solutions with even greater improvement in operational efficiencies. As we've discussed for fiscal year '12, there are many levers that will drive Compuware's topline growth and margin expansion. Our market-leading matured businesses are profitable and stable, our SaaS solutions are two of the fastest-growing in the world. Our growth drivers are realizing their potential of moving the positions of dominance in their over $1 billion categories. 
The drive to capitalize our competitive advantage is what keeps us up at night. We have the opportunity to build Compuware APM to a $2 billion, 40% margin business. Covisint is already the name brand solution for securely sharing information and apps in complex industries. With Covisint's market leadership established, we'll focus on taking advantage of the rejuvenation of the manufacturing industry and the billions of dollars flowing into healthcare. 
Meanwhile, we'll continue to execute on the fundamentals. We need to meet our Q4 and full year goals. We're comfortable with the consensus analysts' estimates for Q4 and the full year. As always, there is work to be done in hitting our Q4 target and in completing a strong growth plan for fiscal year '12. We have the remarkable people and the solutions to make it happen. Now that we've achieved consistency in growth, our focus is to accelerate that growth.

26883,118361272,96566,"Compuware Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Compuware Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continue to achieve consistent results. This quarter's results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year topline revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20%",565,"Thanks, Bob. Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continue to achieve consistent results. This quarter's results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year topline revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20%, up from 15.7% from the year ago period and 18% last quarter. Our efforts to grow the business while keeping costs in line continue to show results. 
In terms of cost, total operating expenses for the quarter came in at $197 million within our stated guidance of $195 million to $200 million. We have a firm grasp on expense management across the company with the singular focus on impactful investment in those areas that presents the greatest promise. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%. The lower than anticipated tax rate for this quarter is primarily attributable to the passage of tax legislations in December that included, among other things, the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credit back to January 1, 2010. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to come in at 36%.
For the first nine months of fiscal year '11, operating cash flow was $35.8 million. Obviously, we expected cash flow to be higher at this point in the year, and given the importance of timing in the equation, we believe cash flow from operations will be between $175 million and $200 million for the year. While this is a disappointment, I don't believe it is a cause for concern. Numerous factors impact operating cash, including when a deal closes in the quarter, payment options and the term of the transaction. Given where we are at, the $175 million is certainly attainable while the $200 million is still possible and definitely the target we are aiming at. 
We are in a strong cash position. We have ample funds to operate our business and a rock solid balance sheet with no debt. With that said, I'd like to make something very clear about our cash collection. Our accounts receivable are and have always been tremendously secure. As our customer base is primarily composed of the largest and most successful companies in the world, there is very little risk of default, and our history with these customers supports this. We have no issues collecting our receivables. Our customers fully understand the value they receive from our solutions and always pay to continue receiving that value. In fact, our over 90 days AR represents only 1.5% of our total receivables of which more than 50% was collected in the first half of January. 
Regarding the stock buyback. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for about $57.6 million. We will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
Q3 represents another good performance for Compuware. And with each successive quarter, we continue to see ample evidence that our strategy and the implementation of our strategy is working. Be it top line growth, the mounting success of our key growth drivers such as APM and Covisint, and margin expansion in the services business, the consistent stability of our maintenance base or the improvement in our overall operating margin, the momentum we are experiencing across the organization is abundantly apparent. 
The bottom line is that Compuware is in fantastic shape and in prime position to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that we all know are there for the taking. Lisa?"

We saw the mainframe MIPS, as reported by IBM, grow substantially. Some of those is new capacity and some of those are just replacing existing MIPS with new hardware.

So the capacity deals are tough because we don't always know and have full insight into the timing, when these MIPS come online. As you said, the second half of the year, we are 4x the number of maintenance renewals. We were conservative all along this year because, as we stated before, of our top 15 customers, only one has a scheduled renewal for this year. So some of the big deals that we typically see have not been there that will come up in later cycles. But we're encouraged. We really are encouraged by the numbers that we saw in Q3.

So we have a trajectory of growth with each of our solution lines right now. We'll extend that trajectory in the fiscal year '12. Then we have additional levers on the business that will drive topline revenue growth and margin expansion. Some of those levers include improved sales productivity. So I know that sounds like a general theme, but we measure that down to the individual. And our average productivity so far to date has gone up substantially per rep. There's still room for improvement, and we'll see that growth continue in fiscal year '12. First Mile will hit the market place and that is another lever. The CloudSleuth MSP program that will drive incremental revenue through all those partners that I talked about through CloudSleuth into the Gomez platform and then into the whole application delivery chain is another lever that will be incremental to the trajectory that we just talked about. The partners in channels numbers, we still fully expect, especially because of the success we've seen this year in its initial launch, to come in and represent about 25% of our revenue in fiscal year '12. Obviously, the scale of that is much more topline based and obviously not as much cost, and our partners will win substantially from that because they'll have services consultancy capabilities and/or hardware capabilities around those. So we're looking at also some levers on the services side. I talked briefly about them. We are very encouraged about the ability to grow or improve our margin expansion as topline revenue grows. The only thing that would slow that down at all is that we have a Gomez platform that we still need to build out some additional infrastructure in Asia Pac and in South America to make sure that we are best in class in those geographies. Obviously, that will have a return on investment but not the equal ratio that we'd see in that growth in North America as an example. So that's how we're thinking about it. One other comment, if you'll allow me, the other thing is this business unit structure, I'll comment a little about, when we want to add cost or programs or anything else, there will be a counterbalance to that, that's based upon an ROI inside the company, that the business unit will basically sign off on to make sure that we're all agreeing and that there are internal controls to measure and drive any return on investment on new investments that we want to make, whether it be sales tools, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be in people, what have you.

There's typically add-on opportunities and there are two ways or characteristics the cross-selling activity of the two groups.

We've got a three-year strategy in our APM business. And the first, besides all the ease of use stuff, more -- that kind of stuff that we're adding all the time, the next major footprint that we will add is sort of business intelligence layer. Now a lot of people are talking business intelligence, predictive analytics. Not in APM but in other areas of IT. The challenge is, a lot of these companies don't have access to the data, so that's what they struggle with. We have access to massive amounts of data that comes in that can provide very quick and value-based business intelligence but it takes incredibly complex algorithms and analytics and engines and people, very bright people, to be able to apply those. With BEZ, we were looking at some of the other predictive analytics companies before we picked up BEZ, both the ones we were looking at got picked up for $100 million. BEZ was a non-material cost mostly because haven't really gotten going from a market share perspective, but their technology capability, we believe, was as good as any of the others. And so uniquely applying predictive analytics and business intelligence on top of this wealth of information we're grabbing from around the world, getting down into the individual application components, so we can start to show not just where the applications are performing poorly but what elements from third parties or CDM ISPs or partners that are starting to have an impact on the end map [ph] is going to be critical. The next big push that we'll have, and I'm not going to say much about it for competitive reasons, is what we're calling active performance management. Certainly, we're continuing to look and analyze that marketplace to see if anything makes sense. There is absolutely nothing imminent. The only other thing that I'll tell you is that our board is very anxious to get to a position of a 40% market share of a $6 billion to $7 billion addressable market as predicted by the analyst by 2013. You can do the math. That's a tremendous amount of growth in the next two years. And we're certainly not going to get there completely organically. So we'll be careful. We'll take a look at everything. When we see great value out there like we did with BEZ, we'll run at it. But nothing imminent right now."

26883,118361272,96634,"Compuware Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Compuware Corporation","Executives"," Thanks, Lisa. Compuware delivered another strong on target quarter increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3’s year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The",1728," Thanks, Lisa. Compuware delivered another strong on target quarter increasing revenues, operating margin and earnings per share sequentially and year-over-year. Q3’s year-over-year comparisons include EPS up 36% and total revenues up more than 7%. The highlights for the quarter include strong performances in our mainframe, Covisint and professional services business.
 Compuware is now consistently achieving business success. We have met or exceeded consensus analyst expectations for EPS for 6 straight quarters; we are vigilantly managing our margins and showing profitability in our mature businesses. Simultaneously we are investing in the businesses that will drive Compuware’s breakout growth both in revenue and in earnings in the years ahead.
 For application performance management, we find ourselves with the best in class solution in a high-growth category. Most companies today are investing in strategic web-based apps due to the promise of top line revenue growth, improved market share and brand awareness. This dramatic increase in Web-based applications, Cloud computing, multi-devices and virtualization all drive the need for greater visibility of application performance inside and outside the firewall.
 Compuware has the only solution to this problem and offers a single dashboard with deep dive analytics across the entire application delivery and chain giving executives and practitioners critical performance information. This capability has created significant separation from our competitors. Furthermore, we have the ability to measure the app’s performance based upon the end-user experience, which is the point where IT delivers value to the business.
 This is the only meaningful way of solving the problem and only Compuware can do it. Our intention is to further this competitive gap with more disruptive value based capabilities in the coming quarters. This fiscal year we have gained well over 400 new application performance management customers, a rapid rate of market penetration that I expect to increase.
 Gomez has become one of the most important solutions in the Internet business. Q3 was the best bookings quarter in Gomez’s history with 31% year-over-year bookings growth on a pro forma basis to more than $28 million. Gomez also delivered nearly 26% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis to $18 million. We added 133 net new Gomez customers in Q3.
 We continue to mature our ability to sell and deliver Gomez internationally. In Q3 we added a number of cornerstone international customers including a leading sports apparel brand, the world’s second largest telecom company, and one of the world’s most important data protection firms. Our infrastructure expansion will continue outside of North America, which will further bolster our growth in coming quarters.
 Total APM revenues, made up of Gomez and Vantage were strong year-over-year, in fact up 34% on a GAAP basis. Vantage license fees and maintenance were both up year-over-year and sequentially, but just short of our goals due to nothing more than a few deals slipping at the end of the quarter. As a result, our overall Q4 pipeline for Vantage is stronger than we expected.
 In Q3 we also strengthened our competitive position in APM with our acquisition of BEZ Systems. This is a great example of gaining competitive advantage faster and cheaper than we could build it. For nonmaterial cost, this advanced analytics engine will help us win more business through predicted monitoring and business analytics on top of the platform.
 This capability is a key part of our three year road map and will start to have a revenue impact in Q2 of fiscal year ’12. In Q3 we also expected a controlled launch – executed a controlled launch of First Mile, which is going as well as any launch in Compuware history. As a reminder, First Mile is a preconfigured appliance with the integrated Gomez and Vantage solutions that is up and running within minutes.
 This controlled launch is giving us the information and positive feedback we need to execute flawlessly on the broader solution launch. We will launch a vertical industry release of First Mile next week for the retail industry, and move forward with specific solutions for other segments in the months ahead. We believe First Mile provides us with the best opportunity to become the global standard for APM in the years to come.
 The overall solution value and time to achieve that value are unprecedented in the industry and certainly can’t be matched through handshake partnerships. Furthermore, the rate of innovation on the SaaS platform will allow our customers to achieve best in class capabilities rapidly.
 Our Covisint solution for secured collaboration produced an outstanding Q3 featuring nearly 33% revenue growth. This growth was driven largely by healthcare revenue, which increased more than 42% in the quarter. Our healthcare segment produced several notable wins including Northeastern Pennsylvania Health Information Exchange, the Vermont Blueprint for Health initiative, and we have just recently announced the Greater Tulsa Health Association Network.
 We are well on track to having four state health information exchanges by the end of the year. Obviously conditional timing on the state based decisions with additional growth coming from hospitals, medical associations and physician practices. Our quality of care and outcome based solutions are making a substantial difference in our competitive positioning.
 In Q4, a larger portion of Covisint’s recognized revenue will be driven by patient quality reporting initiate. Covisint is a leading submitter of such data to Medicaid and our capacity for supporting outcomes based care will propel future increases in revenue. The manufacturing vertical to Covisint is showing renewed vigor with more than 27% jump in revenue year-over-year. We’re also establishing a market leadership position in the oil and gas vertical, a position we intend to solidify in the coming quarters.
 In Q3, Covisint backlog grew to nearly $140 million. Bottom line, the Covisint business is growing aggressively with no end in sight. Our biggest objective is to scale thoughtfully without compromising one bit of quality.
 Partners remain a critical component of our strategy with their ability to drive incremental revenue and brand awareness at a lower cost of sales. Both Cisco and Accenture continue to produce meaningful revenues, we gear up to drive greater market opportunities for all of our partners.
 Our continued focus on managed service providers in the cloud and outsources are paying off as we close two multi-year commitments this quarter with global service providers. Parties who have brought us in the business with global brands like the Olympic Games, Bombardier and AstraZeneca. Our partner focus also extends our capacity for executing in high-growth markets.
 Working with companies like Hitachi, Verizon, AT&T, HCL, and Accenture we are significantly increasing our footprint in Brazil, India and China. During fiscal year ’12 through these partners in Asia Pac and in Europe, we will launch offerings for cloud computing that feature Compuware solutions.
 We’re also having success with our CloudSleuth.net performance portal, where we now have 14 managed service providers on board, and another 10 that are currently being onboarded. This initiative will not only drive incremental revenues, but will expand our thought leadership position.
 Compuware mainframe solutions had a solid Q3 with a nearly 34% increase in license fees year-over-year. We have seen some uptick from the z10 [ph] release that I will expect to continue over the coming years. Renewables remain well over 90% of the value we deliver continues to be validated by the marketplace. Reducing mainframe operating cost, improving program of productivity, a transitioning labor force remain key market drivers for these very important solutions. The environment remains competitive, but we are the market leaders in the productivity tools category and as such continue to win.
 Compuware’s professional services business is another positive turnaround story. We had another quarter the business produced improved margins year-over-year and grew both revenues and margins sequentially. We have achieved what we expected to be our Q4 goal in Q3 with the stated goal of 15% margin, with a core professional services margin of 17%, excluding the solution delivery group.
 Our focus on differentiated services offerings will allow us to grow that margin even more next year. Our solution delivery group is showing consistent improvement, which is the key to further revenue and margin expansion of our overall services numbers.
 Uniface continues to provide solid margins and improved license revenue growth. Uniface’s ability to deliver rich Internet, two-tier and cloud applications makes it a logical choice as development cycles decrease and environments become much more Internet based.
 Our Changepoint results in Q3 were not as strong as we had anticipated. Our more focused go to market approach for the solution has great promise, and Changepoint
 Revenue appears to be rebounding nicely this quarter in Q4. Just a quick word around the next step in the company’s organizational structure.
 Starting in April, Compuware will be organized around solution business units. This structure will maximize operational visibility for management and investors, while increasing focus, agility, customer responsiveness and win rates for every line of business. We will tell you much more about these plans on our Q4 conference call.
 Our strategy is working, and we will continue to strive to deliver market leading solutions with even greater improvement in operational efficiencies. As we have discussed for fiscal year 12, there are many levers that will drive Compuware’s top line growth and margin expansion. Our market leading matured businesses are profitable and stable; our SaaS solutions are two of the fastest growing in the world.
 Our growth drivers are realizing their potential and moving to positions of dominance in their over $1 billion categories. The drive to capitalize our competitive advantage is what keeps us up at night. We have the opportunity to build Compuware APM to a $2 billion 40% margin business. Covisint is already the name brand solution for securely sharing information and apps in complex industries.
 With Covisint’s market leadership established, we are focused on taking advantage of rejuvenation of the manufacturing industry and the billions of dollars flowing in healthcare. Meanwhile, we will continue to execute on the fundamentals. We need to meet our Q4 and full year goals. We’re comfortable with the consensus analyst estimates for Q4 and the full year.
 As always, there is work to be done in hitting our Q4 targets and in completing a strong growth plan for fiscal year ’12. We have the remarkable people and the solutions to make it happen. Now that we have achieved consistency in growth, our focus is to accelerate that growth. Laura.

Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to",566," Thanks Bob. Q3 was another positive step forward for Compuware as we continued to achieve consistent results. This quarter’s results are highlighted by 7.5% year-over-year top line revenue growth. Also during the quarter, our operating margin jumped to 20% up from 15.7% in the year ago period, and 18% last quarter. Our efforts to grow the business while keeping costs in-line continue to show results.
 In terms of cost, total operating expenses for the quarter came in at $197 million, within our stated guidance of $195 million to $200 million. We have a firm grip on expense management across the company with a singular focus on [ph] investment in those areas that present the greatest promise.
 Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%. The lower than anticipated tax rate for this quarter is primarily attributable to the passage of tax legislation in December that included among other things a retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credits back to January 1, 2010. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to come in at 36%.
 For the first nine months of fiscal year ‘11, operating cash flow was $35.8 million. Obviously we expected cash flow to be higher at this point in the year and given the importance of timing and the equation, we believe cash flow from operations will be between $175 billion and $200 billion [ph] for the year. While this is a disappointment, I don’t believe it is a cause for concern. Numerous factors impact operating cash, including when a deal closes in the quarter, payment options, and the term of the transaction.
 Given where we are at the $175 million is certainly attainable, while the $200 million is still possible and definitely the target we are aiming at. We are in a strong cash position. We have ample funds to operate our business and a rock solid balance sheet with no debt.
 With that said, I would like to make something very clear about our cash collection. Our accounts receivable are and have always been tremendously secure. As our customer base is primarily composed of the largest and most successful companies in the world, there is very little risk of default, and our history with these customers supports this. We have no issues collecting our receivables.
 Our customers fully understand the value they receive from our solutions and always pay to continue receiving that value. In fact, our over 90 days AR represents only 1.5% of our total receivables of which more than 50% was collected in the first half of January.
 Regarding the stock buyback, in Q2 we repurchased 5.4 million shares for about $57.6 million. We will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow. Q3 represents another good performance for Compuware, and with each successive quarter we continue to see ample evidence that our strategy and the implementation of our strategy is working, be it top line growth, the mounting success of our key growth drivers such as APM and Covisint, and margin expansion in the services business, the consistent stability of our maintenance base or the improvement in their overall operating margins, the momentum we are experiencing across the organization is abundantly apparent.
 The bottom line is that Compuware is in fantastic shape and in prime position to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that we all now is there for the taking. Lisa.

So we have a trajectory of growth with each of our solution lines right now. We'll extend that trajectory in the fiscal year '12. Then we have additional levers on the business that will drive top line revenue growth and margin expansion. Some of those levers include improved sales productivity. So I know that sounds like a general theme, but we measure that down to the individual and our average productivity so far to-date has gone up substantially per rep.
 There is still room for improvement and we'll see that growth continue in fiscal year '12. First Mile will hit the marketplace and that is another lever. The CloudSleuth MSP program that will drive incremental revenue through those – all those partners that I talked about through CloudSleuth into the Gomez platform, and then into the whole application delivery chain is another lever that will be incremental to the trajectory that we just talked about. The partners and channels numbers we still fully expect especially because of the success we've seen this year in its initial launch to come in and represent about 25% of our revenue in the fiscal year '12.
 Obviously the scale of that is much more top line based and obviously not as much cost, and our partners will win substantially from that because they will add services consultancy capabilities and/or hardware capabilities around those. So we're looking at also some levers on the services side. I talked briefly about them. We are very encouraged about the ability to grow or improve our margin expansion as top line revenue grows. The only thing that would slow that down at all is that we have a Gomez platform that we still need to build out some additional infrastructure in Asia-Pac and in South America to make sure that we are best-in-class in those geographies.
 Obviously, that will have a return on investment, but not the equal ratio that we would see in that growth in North America as an example. So that’s how we are thinking about it. One other comment, if you will allow me, the other thing is this business unit structure, I will comment a little bit about. When we want to add costs or programs or anything else, there will be a counterbalance to that based upon ROI inside the company. The business unit will basically sign off on to make sure that we are all agreeing in their internal controls to measure and drive any return on investment on new investments that we want to make, whether it be sales tools, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be in people, what have you, and I think that will increase our efficiency and discipline, and that ultimately will hit the bottom line next year also.

So there's a very small percentage right now that are sold both Gomez and Vantage at the same time. There is typically add-on opportunities, and there are two ways of characteristic the cross selling activity of the two groups. It has been light, where it has happened, it has been remarkably successful. So the win rate is very high, but the cross selling activity has not been high enough. One of the ways in which we’re working on solving that is through this business unit structure.
 Basically we’ll have an integrated sales organization with the ability to have everything in their kitbag, and a very well defined maturity model. So it will be in the best interest of our customers to basically take them from where they are at today and evolve them into a best-in-class application performance management company. And you’ll start to hear less about Gomez and Vantage and more about the overall APM business unit growth in sales and profitability moving forward, and we’ll still have the ability to carve out subscription to give you better transparency, but the point is with the First Mile appliance we basically have a single solution that is driving inside the datacenter visibility and full capability of outside the firewall measurements and testing, and we plan on expanding that appliance's capability throughout the year.

The integrated sales force, we’re delivering some very, very cool business impact, value proposition stuff next quarter.
 The channels are starting to really show signs of maturity, and we have, I think, at the expense of some of our competition made some considerable inroads with partners. So that’s been positive. We’re making considerable inroads in other geographies, where there may be a local competition that you probably haven’t heard of, but overall, I have listened to the earnings calls of companies that were not tonight, obviously because they are simultaneous tonight, and our growth rates, our value proposition, footprint, and our strategy moving forward meaning we’re just going to keep on innovating, innovating, innovating.

Let me talk about BEZ real quickly, so you can understand how that fits in. So we’ve got a three-year strategy in our APM business, and the first besides all the ease-of-use stuff, more analytic – that kind of stuff that we are adding all the time. The next major footprint that we will add is the business intelligence layer. Now, a lot of people are talking business intelligence predictive analytics, not in APM but in other areas of IT. The challenge is a lot of these companies don’t have access to the data. So that’s what they struggle with. We have access to massive amounts of data that comes in that it can provide very quick and value-based business intelligence, but it takes incredibly complex algorithms and analytics and engines and people, very bright people to be able to apply those.
 With BEZ, and we were looking at some of the other predictive analytics companies before we picked up BEZ, both the ones we’re looking at got picked up for $100 million. BEZ was a non-material cost, mostly because they hadn’t really gotten going from a market share perspective, but their technology capability we believe was as good as any of the others. And so uniquely applying predictive analytics and business intelligence on top of this wealth of information we're grabbing from around the world, getting down into the individual application components, so we can start to show not just where the applications are performing poorly, but what elements from third parties or CDNs, ISPs, or partners that are starting to have an impact on the end app is going to be critical.
 The next big push that we'll have and I'm not going to say much about it for competitive reasons is what we're calling active performance management. Certainly, we're continuing to look and analyze that marketplace to see if anything makes sense. There is absolutely nothing imminent. The only other thing I'll tell you is that our board is very anxious to get to a position of a 40% market share of a $6 billion to $7 billion addressable market as predicted by the analyst by 2013. You can do the math. That's a tremendous amount of growth, and – in the next two years and we're certainly not going to get there completely organically, so we'll be careful. We'll take a look at everything when we see great value out there like we did with BEZ. We'll run at it, but nothing imminent right now.

Compuware growth drivers' outperformance in fiscal year '11 points for continued acceleration in fiscal year '12. Compuware earned $0.48 in fiscal year '11, $0.16 per share in Q4. Fiscal year '11 APM license and subscription fees skyrocket 91.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis to $145.5 million. License and subscription fees up 34.1% on a pro forma basis. Fiscal year '11 Covisint revenues slipped 36% year-over-year to $55 million. Final Q4 results APM license fees and subscriptions up 54%, Covisint revenue up 65.6%, Uniface license fees up 76.7%, Changepoint license fees up 14.3% year-over-year professional Services segment contribution margin over 15%. 
Fiscal year '12 guidance predicts ongoing revenue growth, increased EPS and strong cash flow. Compuware Corporation, a technology performance company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Compuware increased total revenues, software license fees, maintenance and subscription fees and Professional Services fees year-over-year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $487 million, up from $456.3 million in the previous year. Software license fees were $194.7 million compared to $194.5 million in the previous year. Professional Services fees were $247.2 million, up from $241.3 million in the previous year. 
Fiscal year 2011 revenues were $928.9 million, up from $892.2 million in the previous year. GAAP net income was $107.4 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $140.8 million GAAP and $93.7 million pro forma in fiscal year 2010. GAAP earnings per share were $0.48 in fiscal year '11 compared to $0.60 GAAP and $0.40 pro forma in fiscal year '10 based upon 226.1 million and 234.6 million shares outstanding, respectively. Fiscal year 2010 net income and earnings per share benefited from a nonrecurring $52.4 million gain from the divestiture of certain product lines and $20.7 million in other income related to a legal settlement.
During the company's fourth quarter, software license fees were $55.7 million, up from $51.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $124 million in the fourth quarter, up from $117.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue from Professional Services in the fourth quarter was $69.9 million, up from $60.3 million in the same quarter last year. During the fourth quarter, total revenues were $249.6 million, up from $230 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $34.8 million compared to $37.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.16 compared to $0.16 last year based upon 224.4 million and 228.7 million shares outstanding, respectively. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

With strong performance by our growth drivers leading the way  Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011.

With strong performance by our growth drivers leading the way  Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011. We met or exceeded our yearly guidance for EPS growth in our APM business, increased Covisint revenue and from improvement in Professional Service margins. In addition, both Uniface and Changepoint solutions showed increases in year-over-year license fees, while Professional Services returned to year-over-year revenue growth in Q4. In the year ahead, we expect accelerated growth by our APM and Covisint business units as well as ongoing strong profitability and revenue growth from Professional Services, Uniface and Changepoint solutions. We also see a more positive mainframe environment in fiscal year '12. 
We believe we will post an approximately 10% increase in total revenue in fiscal year '12. We will achieve this by accelerating our investments in APM and Covisint, complemented with continued operational improvements in the rest of our business units. 
We are witnessing strong category growth and therefore, extraordinary opportunities over the next few years in performance management and SaaS based collaboration. To guarantee our position in both markets, it makes business sense to strike while the iron is hot. Our increased investments will have minimal impact on EPS for fiscal year '12 as there will be return on these investments during the fiscal year that will offset the expenses. The revenue growth and resulting margin expansion for these investments will be dramatic in fiscal year '13 and '14. 
On the APM side, these investments will include acceleration of the internationalized portal platform, acceleration of mobile performance solutions and development of predictive analytics engines. For Covisint, these investments will include a performance-based information solution, sales expansion into more geographies and new vertical industry initiatives. 
Overall this year, we expect to produce approximately $1.02 billion in revenue and GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.57 per share, a year-over-year EPS increase of 10% to 19%. In Q1, we expect $0.05 to $0.07 in earnings per share reflecting normal seasonality of our business. 
Obviously, we feel confident about these businesses due to our great success last year. In fiscal year '11, we projected APM license growth for more than 20% and SaaS revenue of $65 million. We surpassed these goals by delivering more than 30% increase in license fees and subscription revenues by nearly $68 million. Building on that success, we expect at least 35% increase in combined APM new license and subscription fees in fiscal year '12. Nearly half of our APM business will be SaaS-based. And with our integrated sales team, we expect to see improvement across all key sales metrics: pipeline, close ratios and sales. 
We have staked out a differentiated solution in the market and customers are responding. I recently spoke with a CIO of a large financial institution. He has more than 100 monitoring tools to keep his most important applications working, applications that quite literally cost millions of dollars per hour of downtime. What Compuware offers enterprise and any company that depends on web, mobile or enterprise applications is broad visibility, deep-dive analytics and the simplicity of one solution to do it all. So this CIO can simplify his portfolio tools and get the market's only capabilities for optimizing the performance of important applications from the data center to the cloud, to the edge of the Internet on user's mobile device. That's a compelling value proposition. And customers worldwide and absolutely demanding this capability to manage application performance from the end-user perspective. 
In this competitive landscape, Compuware has both first mover advantage and the most complete solution. We believe, and it's backed by industry analysts, that the APM market space addressable by our solutions could be as much as $6 billion in the coming years and growing, and our long-term goal is to own 40% of this market. To achieve this goal, we will capitalize our competitive advantages to deliver rapid organic growth. We may also augment our capabilities and market share through acquisitions. 
In the meantime, we continue to deliver market-changing APM releases. We recently competed -- completed our second integrated launch of Compuware Gomez, which followed our May 10 release of First Mile. Our rollout of First Mile to the retail vertical has produced a very positive market response, many new customers and a healthy pipeline of active opportunities. First Mile designed to rapidly demonstrate our value proposition, opening accounts to our on-premise APM solutions. We are therefore focusing First Mile entirely on either greenfield or SaaS-only-based accounts. First Mile will drive material revenue contribution this fiscal year.
Turning to mobility, virtualization and cloud computing continue to benefit Compuware. Complexity in IT required simplicity in solutions. It creates demand for our differentiated value proposition today, visibility across the entire application delivery chain that also sets us up for greater growth in the future. Long-term, Compuware's road map will not only provide visibility and deep-dive analytics, which remain critical, but we'll also eliminate the data that surrounds many APM tools. We are serving up-to-date the most pertinent, actionable and important, saving people time and making them money. The value and simplicity we offer revolutionizes APM, just as Compuware many years ago revolutionized mainframe thought management. 
Joining APM on a rapid growth path, Covisint continues to expand and mature business. In fiscal year 2011, Covisint increased its year-over-year revenues nearly 36% to $55 million. Based on this growth rate, which we expect to accelerate in the year ahead, we believe a partial carve out IPO for Covisint could happen sometime this fiscal year. Our threshold for executing this program will be $1 billion valuation. 
The healthcare space continue to produce big wins for Covisint, and agreements in Montana has shown us that the health information exchange market is evolving to a strong focus on outcomes-based care. We are already leading the market with strong references of large healthcare systems becoming accountable care organizations. With a combination of our patient quality reporting initiative capabilities and our secured collaboration platform, Covisint is taking advantage of the rapid growth in this space.
PQRI payments in the patient quality reporting initiatives are seasonal and provided a tailwind to Q4 results. Those will go down in Q1, which will result in a modest decrease in Q1 revenues for Covisint, but they will continues to increase on a year-over-year basis as we will continues to see the same bump next year. 
By segment, Covisint it is now 40% healthcare, 40% manufacturing and 20% emerging sectors. We are starting to see signs that the multienterprise collaboration is defined category and we look forward to discussing nonvertical Fortune 50 deals this quarter -- next quarter. There are no guerilla competitors in any of Covisint's vertical markets. We're competing and winning against systems integrators are traditional tools that lack the flexibility, agility and pricing advantages of our cloud-based model. Based on these market conditions and our competitive differentiation, we believe Covisint will produce an over 40% increase in revenues this year.
In addition to these growth engines, partnerships remain a critical focus in fiscal year '12. Partner or distributor-owned or influenced transactions approached $50 million in fiscal year '11. This year, our target is over $100 million. We intend to achieve that goal by expanding our relationships with Tier 1 partners like Cisco and Accenture and by strong focus on the managed service provider space. 
Compuware has entered into a first of its kind strategic OEM agreement with Cisco data center business unit. Through this agreement, we will standardize on the Cisco unified computing system platform for delivering Compuware solutions to customers. This create the opportunities for us to engage the Cisco team to identify new prospects and to enable partner driven sales. 
We have also entered a formal alliance with Accenture to resell Compuware products suites. These alliance produced several wins in fiscal year '11 including our largest APM transactions. We expect this partnership will continue to produce large wins in fiscal year '12. 
Our APM solutions offer compelling value propositions in the managed service providers. By helping MSPs deliver better services to their customers, we grew our MSP business by 30% in fiscal year '11, like Verizon, British Telecom, Cable & Wireless will continue to provide big opportunities for growth in the MSP space this year.
In the Mainframe Solutions area, we expect to soon close 2 deals that slipped out of Q4. We plan to close the agreement with a large financial institutions this quarter, and we believe we will complete our agreement with the federal government sometime in Q2. Beyond this deal, federal budget dynamics are not impacting our business. 
We feel more optimistic about the Mainframe business in fiscal year '12. This year's renewal pipeline for agreements of more than $500,000 is 17% larger than last year's, which present strong opportunities for footprint expansion. We succeed as such renewals scenarios because we have strong relationships around the value of our products that we deliver.  This is a key focus for Mainframe Solutions business unit this year, maintaining, expanding our footprint by proving our value. This is an extremely important market, and competitors will continue to try to attack purchasing agents with cheap knock-offs. Compuware has been and is recognized value and technology leader in this space. And with our ever strengthening ability to represent customized return on investment information, we'll continue to win against less capable offers. Given these dynamics, we expect total Mainframe revenues to be flat to low single-digit in fiscal year '12.
Over the last 2 years, our Professional Services business has achieved remarkable reinvention. We achieved our primary goal of services of fiscal year '11, a dramatically improved margin. Our focus on high-margin, high-value work has also resulted on our first return to quarterly revenue growth in Services in fiscal 2001. 
Leaving our implementation and low margins to others, we bring highly skilled technicians to bear on some of our customers' most pressing technology problems. In the year ahead, we expect to produce Professional Services segment revenue growth between 5% and 10%. Our skill in mobile and cloud application development, driven to our center of excellence in global delivery organization, will fuel this growth. We expect this increase in revenue and our continued focus on margin management will push our core Professional Services margins to 20%. 
We achieved great success last year, and the entire Compuware team is eagerly starting to build on the success in fiscal year '12. With our new business units structure, we're taking our competitive advantage in key markets and raising to capitalize on them. This structure has empowered our lines of business to respond quickly to market conditions and competitive opportunities. This fast, efficient and entrepreneurial model that positions us for an outstanding year. The Compuware team is unified and energized around this goal, and we're working hard already to make it a reality. Laura?"

Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved good results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. Opera",641,"Thanks, Bob. Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved good results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. 
Operating cash flow for Q4 came in at a very strong $124.3 million, and we finished the year with a total of $160 million. As I mentioned in the precall, operating cash flow for the year was negatively impacted by lower accounts receivable collections primarily in the Mainframe segment. While operating cash flow for the year was lighter than we originally anticipated, we remain in the strong cash position with no outstanding debt.
As for operating expenses for fiscal year '11, we had $779 million in total operating expenses. This is below our original guidance as we effectively managed costs while still investing to support our growth. I did want to make one note about the total number of expenses though in our application services Covisint segment. On our fact sheet, we do note that the margin is about 2.3%. One thing that did affect that margin is we recorded a catch-up adjustment of about $1.9 million for compensation expense related to stock options. And without that adjustment, our application services margin would have been 11.2%. Just one little note there. But going forward in fiscal year '12, we will continue to practice disciplined expense management to optimize our operating margin while being mindful of the necessary investments needed to drive our top line in fiscal year '12 and beyond.
Fiscal year '12 operating expenses are expected to be approximately $825 million to $840 million. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our investments in the APM and Covisint business units to take advantage of the incredible market opportunities for these 2 segments. These investments will primarily be in the sales and technology groups.
And for fiscal year '12, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $160 million to $175 million. This estimate again reflects the targeted investments in our business units. With regard to the stock buyback in Q4, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for about $45 million. That brings our total repurchases for fiscal year '11 to approximately 17 million shares for nearly $161 million. Currently, we have approximately 219 million shares outstanding. In terms of future buyback activity, we will continue to evaluate business for economic conditions and buy back stock when it's prudent to do so.
Lastly, our effective tax rate for fiscal year '11 was approximately 31%, while the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%. This artificially low rate in Q4 was primarily due to increase in tax credits related to the U.S. research and experimentation tax credit, including the impact of retroactively reinstated the credit to January 1, 2010, and the settlement of R&D credits related to fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 tax periods with the Internal Revenue Service.
For fiscal year '12, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 34% for the entire year. This range is below the normal expectation of 36% due to changes in the Michigan income tax that are expected to be final very soon. Assuming this legislation is passed, our effective tax rate for the first quarter will be less than 20%, as it will reflect the benefit of the Michigan tax changes. Subsequently, we expect our effective tax rate to return to 36% for quarters 2, 3 and 4. 
Fiscal year '11 was an extremely solid year for Compuware in which we witnessed robust growth in our APM & Covisint businesses, continued stability in our very important Mainframe maintenance base and resurgence in our Professional Services, Changepoint and Uniface businesses. In fiscal year '12, we will build on the successes as we strive to fulfill our substantial potential.

So just to be safe side, I think 160, 175 is very safe. And we're certainly, as Mainframe is a strong year, we will probably see increases."

And then honestly in our very strong initiative to simplify all the massive amounts of data out there inside the data center and beyond, doing more in the predictive analytics area to really break open the differentiation. I would also want to point out one thing. Last Thursday, we had a pretty robust board meeting. And under direction of the board and our Chairman, it was determined that the opportunity in front of us given the category growth and our position and space, was something where we really wanted to maximize our opportunities. So as a result of the request, specific request from the board, we have decided to move a lot of these investments up earlier this year and even from next fiscal year to this year, to make sure that we are taking advantage of what right now is an extremely hot category whether you look at it in our terms or general market conditions.

So I think we're feeling pretty good about protecting the value and therefore, protecting the prices. But certainly, we will on occasion see some price pressures from some of the other competitors."

So the 2 initial majors the implementations have gotten very well. We've got a nice ROI that we're building upon and because of the success we're being taken to other areas, not just upstream but downstream. I will also mention. There's a couple comments I made on this in my formal remarks. But we're starting to see a trend in multienterprise collaboration going to move towards more mature category. We're getting requests from some of the largest household brand name companies to come in and solve problems outside of our traditional verticals. And while we're not sure if this is sort of early traditional adopter pool, category is forming, becoming more mainstream, we're paying very, very close attention to that. Obviously, this will be all incremental to potential of the guidance and the business plan that we formed to date.

I think the APM overall competitive landscape is heating up. And part of that is because certainly Gartner and a number of others have talked about the dramatic increase in requests that they're getting around performance management, consolidation not just in data center but across cloud virtualization mobile technologies. We thought this was going to happen a couple of years ago, which is why declared a major here. And sure enough, it's created a response. and there are 2 kind of responses that we're seeing in the field. Number one is certainly the kind of thing that we would expect to see from a larger player, so BMC, recognizing the opportunity for growth has jumped in. We applaud that. We think it is a great move. I think it helps validate the technologies and solutions that are being offered there today. Caridian offers up a quite a subset of what we deliver inside the data center. And I think it's healthy for the category overall and create more visibility for everybody in that space. We also are watching in the web-based world, there are opportunities for smaller companies to grow rapidly. And while they don't present any kind of threat from a material revenue or earnings growth, they certainly do represent opportunities of new kinds of technologies to be introduced in the go viral. While we haven't seen anything dramatic yet, we're certainly watching across the board, if any, if those players become of interest to us. So that's that. I think you'll see a continued acceleration of APM certainly in the next 2 to 3 years and probably longer. And that's why we're sort of upping the game, both organically and with some potential acquisitions later on. In the Mainframe space, I guess there's a lot of moving parts. We've got the zSeries. That's been out. Certainly the 34% growth in IBM's announced numbers last quarter in MIPS is on the surface good news. But a lot of that MIPS is replacing existing MIPS on the floor And so you'll see how it goes. What we are seeing with the comeback of the economy, although very slow, there is some capacity being released now. And certainly we continue to expect to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Having said that, again there are some small medium businesses that are moving up to Mainframe and I think most cloud-based initiatives, which represent new opportunities for us that will most likely not be mainframe-based. Some are, but most not, and so we'll see some pressure in the Mainframe side from that also."

Compuware growth drivers' outperformance is clear in '11, poised for continued acceleration in fiscal year '12. Compuware earned $0.48 per share in the fiscal year '11, $0.16 per share in Q4. Fiscal year '11 APM license and subscription fees skyrocket 91.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis to $145.5 million. License and subscription fees up 34.1% on a pro forma basis. Fiscal year '11 Covisint revenues slipped 36% year-over-year to $55 million. Final Q4 results, APM license fees and subscriptions up 54%, Covisint revenue up 65.6%, Uniface license fees up 76.7%, Changepoint license fees up 14.3% year-over-year, Professional Services segment contribution margin over 15%. 
Fiscal year '12 guidance predicts ongoing revenue growth, increased EPS and strong cash flow. Compuware Corporation, the technology performance company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Compuware increased its total revenues, software license fees, maintenance and subscription fees and professional services fees year-over-year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $487 million, up from $456.3 million in the previous year. Software license fees were $194.7 million compared to $194.5 million in the previous year. Professional Services fees were $247.2 million, up from $241.3 million in the previous year. 
Fiscal year 2011 revenues were $928.9 million, up from $892.2 million in the previous year. GAAP net income was $107.4 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $140.8 million GAAP and $93.7 million pro forma in fiscal year 2010. GAAP earnings per share were $0.48 in fiscal year '11 compared to $0.60 GAAP and $0.40 pro forma in fiscal year '10, based upon 226.1 million and 234.6 million shares outstanding, respectively. 
Fiscal year 2010 net income and earnings per share benefited from a nonrecurring $52.4 million gain from the divestiture of certain product lines and $20.7 million in other income related to a legal settlement.
During the company's fourth quarter, software license fees were $55.7 million, up from $51.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $124 million in the fourth quarter, up from $117.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue from Professional Services in the fourth quarter was $69.9 million, up from $60.3 million in the same quarter last year. During the fourth quarter, total revenues were $249.6 million, up from $230 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $34.8 million compared to $37.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.16 compared to $0.16 last year, based upon 224.4 million and 228.7 million shares outstanding, respectively. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

With strong performances by our growth drivers leading the way, Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011. We met or exceeded our yearly guidance for EPS for growth in our APM business, for increased Covisint revenue and from improvemen",1852,"Thanks, Lisa. With strong performances by our growth drivers leading the way, Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011. We met or exceeded our yearly guidance for EPS for growth in our APM business, for increased Covisint revenue and from improvements in Professional Service margins. In addition, both Uniface and Changepoint solutions showed increases in year-over-year license fees, while Professional Services returned to year-over-year revenue growth in Q4. In the year ahead, we expect accelerated growth by our APM and Covisint business units, as well as ongoing strong profitability and revenue growth from Professional Services, Uniface and Changepoint solutions. We also see a more positive mainframe environment in fiscal year '12. 
We believe we will post an approximately 10% increase in total revenue in fiscal year '12. We will achieve this by accelerating our investments in APM and Covisint, complemented with continued operational improvements in the rest of our business units. 
We are witnessing strong category growth and, therefore, extraordinary opportunities over the next few years in performance management and SaaS-based collaboration. To guarantee our leadership positions in both markets, it makes business sense to strike while the iron is hot. Our increased investments will have minimal impact on EPS for fiscal year '12, as there will be return on these investments during the fiscal year that will offset the expenses. The revenue growth and resulting margin expansion from these investments will be dramatic in fiscal year '13 and '14. 
On the APM side, these investments will include acceleration of the internationalized portal platform, acceleration of mobile performance solutions and development of predictive analytics engines. For Covisint, these investments will include a performance-based health information exchange solution, sales expansion into more geographies and new vertical industry initiatives. 
Overall this year, we expect to produce approximately $1.02 billion in revenue and GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.57 per share, a year-over-year EPS increase of 10% to 19%. In Q1, we expect $0.05 to $0.07 in earnings per share, reflecting normal seasonality of our business. 
Obviously, we feel confident about these businesses due to our great success last year. In fiscal year '11, we projected APM license growth of more than 20% and SaaS revenue was $65 million. We surpassed these goals by delivering more than 30% increase in license fees and subscription revenues of nearly $68 million. Building on that success, we expect an, at least, 35% increase in combined APM new license and subscription fees in fiscal year '12. Nearly half of our APM business will be SaaS-based. And with our integrated sales team, we expect to see improvement across all key sales metrics: pipeline, close ratios and sales repeals. 
We have staked out a differentiated solution in the market, and customers are responding. I recently spoke with a CIO of a large financial institution. He has more than 100 monitoring tools to keep his most important applications working, applications that quite literally cost millions of dollars per hour of downtime. What Compuware offers is enterprise, and any company that depends on web, mobile or enterprise applications is broad visibility, deep-dive analytics and the simplicity of one solution to do it all. 
So this CIO can simplify their portfolio of tools and get the market's only capabilities for optimizing the performance of important applications from the data center to the cloud, to the edge of the Internet on the user's mobile device. That's a compelling value proposition. And customers worldwide are absolutely demanding this capability to manage application performance from the end-user perspective. 
In this competitive landscape, Compuware has both the first-mover advantage and the most complete solution. We believe, and it's backed up by industry analysts, that the APM market space addressable by our solutions could be as much as $6 billion in the coming years and growing, and our long-term goal is to own 40% of this market. To achieve this goal, we will capitalize our competitive advantages to deliver rapid organic growth. We may also augment our capabilities and market share through acquisitions. 
In the meantime, we continue to deliver market-changing APM releases. We recently competed -- completed our second integrated launch of Compuware Gomez, which followed our May 10 release of First Mile. Our rollout of First Mile to the retail vertical has produced a very positive market response, many new customers and a hip and healthy pipeline of active opportunities. First Mile is designed to rapidly demonstrate our value proposition, opening accounts to our on-premise APM solutions. We are, therefore, focusing First Mile entirely on either greenfield or SaaS-only-based accounts. First Mile will drive material revenue contribution this fiscal year.
Trends in mobility, virtualization and cloud computing continue to benefit Compuware. Complexity in IT requires simplicity in solutions. It creates demand for our differentiated value proposition today, visibility across the entire application delivery chain that also sets us up for greater growth in the future. Long term, Compuware's visionary roadmap will not only provide visibility and deep-dive analytics, which remain critical, but we will also eliminate the overwhelming data smog that surrounds many APM tools. We are serving the data that is most pertinent, actionable and important, saving people time and making them money. The value and simplicity we offer revolutionizes distributed APM, just as Compuware have, many years ago, revolutionized mainframe fault management. 
Joining APM on a rapid growth path, Covisint continues to expand and mature its business. In fiscal year 2011, Covisint increased its year-over-year revenues nearly 36% to $55 million. Based on this growth rate, which we expect to accelerate in the year ahead, we believe a partial carve-out IPO Covisint could happen sometime this fiscal year. Our threshold for executing this program will be $1 billion valuation. 
The healthcare space continue to produce big wins for Covisint, and agreements in Vermont and Montana has shown us that the health information exchange market is evolving toward a strong focus on outcomes-based care. We are already leading the market with strong references of large healthcare systems becoming accountable care organizations. With a combination of our patient-quality reporting initiative capabilities and our secured collaboration platform, Covisint is firmly taking advantage of the rapid growth in this space.
PQRI payments or the patient quality reporting initiative are seasonal and provided a tailwind to Q4 results. Those incentives will go down in Q1, which will result in a modest sequential decrease in Q1 revenues for Covisint, though they will continue to increase on a year-over-year basis, as we will continues to see the same bump next year. 
By segment, Covisint is now 40% healthcare, 40% manufacturing and 20% emerging sectors. We are starting to see signs that the multienterprise collaboration is becoming a defined category, and we look forward to discussing nonvertical Fortune 50 deals this quarter -- next quarter. There are no guerilla competitors in any of Covisint's vertical markets. We're competing and winning against systems integrators or traditional tools that lack the flexibility, agility and pricing advantages of our cloud-based model. Based on these market conditions and our competitive differentiation, we believe Covisint will produce an over 40% increase in revenues this year.
In addition to these growth engines, partners remain a critical focus in fiscal year '12. Partner and distributor-owned or influenced transactions approached $50 million in fiscal year '11. This year, our target is over $100 million. We intend to achieve that goal by expanding our relationships with Tier 1 partners like Cisco and Accenture and by strong focus on the managed service provider space. 
Compuware has entered into a first of its kind strategic OEM agreement with Cisco data center business unit. Through this agreement, we will standardize on the Cisco unified computing system platform for delivering Compuware Gomez solutions to customers. In turn, this will create new opportunities for us to engage with the Cisco team to identify new prospects and to enable partner-driven sales. 
We have also entered a formal alliance with Accenture to resell Compuware products suites. This alliance produced several wins in the fiscal year '11, including our largest APM transaction. We expect this partnership will continue to produce large wins in fiscal year '12. 
Our APM solutions offer compelling value propositions in the managed service providers. By helping MSPs deliver better services to their customers. We grew our MSP business by 30% in fiscal year '11 with partners like Verizon, British Telecom, Cable and Wireless and Atos Origin, and we'll continue to provide big opportunities for growth in the MSP space this year.
In the Mainframe Solutions area, we expect to soon close 2 deals that slipped out of Q4. We plan to close the agreement with a large financial institution this quarter, and we believe we will complete our agreement with the federal government sometime in Q2. Beyond this deal, the federal budget dynamics are not impacting our business. 
We feel more optimistic about the Mainframe business in fiscal year '12. This year's renewal pipeline for agreements of more than $500,000 is 17% larger than last year's, which presents strong opportunities for footprint expansion. We succeed in such renewal scenarios because we have strong relationships around the value of our products that we deliver.  
This is a key focus for Mainframe Solutions business unit this year, maintaining and expanding our footprint by demonstrably proving our value. This is an extremely important market, and the competitors will continue to try to attack purchasing agents with cheap knock-offs. Compuware has been and is a recognized value and technology leader in this space. And with our ever-strengthening ability to represent customized return on investment information, we'll continue to win against less capable offers. Given these dynamics, we expect the total Mainframe revenues to be flat to low single-digit decline in the fiscal year '12.
Over the last 2 years, our Professional Services business has achieved a remarkable reinvention. We achieved our primary goal of services in fiscal year '11, a dramatically improved margin. Our focus on high-margin, high-value work has also resulted on our first return to quarterly revenue growth in services since fiscal 2001. 
Leaving our staff supplementation of low margins to others, we bring highly skilled technicians to bear on some of our customers' most pressing technology problems. In the year ahead, we expect to produce Professional Services segment revenue growth between 5% and 10%. Our proven skill in mobile and cloud application development, driven to our mobile center of excellence and global delivery organization, will fuel this growth. We expect this increase in revenue and our continued focus on margin management will push our core Professional Services margins toward 20%. 
We achieved great success last year, and the entire Compuware team has eagerly started to build on that success in fiscal year '12. With our new business unit structure, we're taking our competitive advantage in key markets and raising to capitalize on them. This structure has empowered our lines of business to respond quickly to market conditions and competitive opportunities. This is a fast, efficient and entrepreneurial model that positions us for an outstanding year. The Compuware team is absolutely unified and energized around this goal, and we're working hard already to make it a reality. Laura?"

Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved great results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. Oper",644,"Thanks, Bob. Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved great results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. 
Operating cash flow for Q4 came in at a very strong $124.3 million, and we finished the year with a total of $160 million. As I mentioned on the precall, operating cash flow for the year was negatively impacted by lower accounts receivable collections primarily in the Mainframe segment. While operating cash flow for the year is lighter than we originally anticipated, we remain in a strong cash position with no outstanding debt.
As for operating expenses. For fiscal year '11, we had $779 million in total operating expenses. This is below our original guidance, as we effectively managed costs while still investing to support our growth. I did want to make one note about the total number of bottom expenses though on our Application Services, our Covisint segment. On our fact sheet, we do note that the margin is about 2.3%. 
One thing that did affect that margin is we recorded a catch-up adjustment of about $1.9 million for compensation expense related to stock options. And without that adjustment, our Application Services margin would have been 11.2%. Just one little note there. But going forward in fiscal year '12, we will continue to practice disciplined expense management to optimize our operating margin, while being mindful of the necessary investments needed to drive our top line in fiscal year '12 and beyond.
Fiscal year '12 operating expenses are expected to be approximately $825 million to $840 million. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our investments in the APM and Covisint business units to take advantage of the incredible market opportunities for these 2 segments. These investments will primarily be in the sales and technology groups.
And for fiscal year '12, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $160 million to $175 million. This estimate again reflects the targeted investments in our business units. With regard to the stock buyback in Q4, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for about $45 million. That brings our total repurchases for fiscal year '11 to approximately 17 million shares for nearly $161 million. Currently, we have approximately 219 million shares outstanding. In terms of future buyback activity, we will continue to evaluate business and economic conditions and buy back stock when it's fiscally prudent to do so.
Lastly, our effective tax rate for fiscal year '11 was approximately 31%, while the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%. This artificially low rate in Q4 was primarily due to an increase in tax credits related to the U.S. research and experimentation tax credit, including the impact of retroactively reinstating the credit to January 1, 2010, and the settlement of R&D credits related to fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 tax periods with the Internal Revenue Service.
For fiscal year '12, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 34% for the entire year. This rate is below the normal expectation of 36% due to changes in the Michigan income tax that are expected to be final very soon. Assuming this legislation is passed, our effective tax rate for the first quarter will be less than 20%, as it will reflect the benefit of the Michigan tax changes. Subsequently, we expect our effective tax rate to return to 36% for quarters 2, 3 and 4. 
Fiscal year '11 was an extremely solid year for Compuware, in which we witnessed robust growth in our APM and Covisint businesses, continued stability in our very important Mainframe maintenance base and resurgence in our Professional Services, Changepoint and Uniface businesses. In fiscal year '12, we will build on the successes as we strive to fulfill our substantial potential. Lisa?"

So if we're going to do that, I think we're going to see the returns in revenue on those areas towards the end of the year, but we may incur some of those expenses in the first 2 quarter. So just to be on the safe side, I think $160 million, $175 million is very safe. And we're certainly, as Mainframe is a strong year, we will probably see increases."

And then honestly, in our very strong initiative to simplify all the massive amounts of data out there, inside the data center and beyond, doing more in the predictive analytics area to really break open the differentiation. I would also want to point out one thing. Last Thursday, we had a pretty robust board meeting. And under direction of the Board and our Chairman, it was determined that the opportunity in front of us, given the category growth and our position and space, was something where we really wanted to maximize our opportunities. So as a result of the request, the specific request from the Board, we have decided to move a lot of these investments up earlier in this year, and even from next fiscal year into this year, to make sure that we are taking advantage of what right now is an extremely hot category, whether you look at it in our terms or general market conditions.

And we have several active conversations going on right now with at least 3. The last time I checked, it was a couple of weeks ago, so at least 3 of the majors in that segment. So the 2 initial majors, the implementations have gotten very well. We've got a nice ROI that we're building upon. And because of the success, we're being taken into other areas of the business, not just upstream but downstream. I will also mention, there's a couple of comments I made on this in my formal remarks, but we're starting to see a trend in multienterprise collaboration, starting to move towards a more mature category. We're getting requests from some of the largest household brand-name companies to come in and solve problems outside of our traditional verticals. And while we're not sure if this is sort of early-traditional or early-adopter pool or if a category is really forming, becoming more mainstream, we're paying very, very close attention to that. Obviously, this will be all incremental to potential -- or the guidance and the business plan that we formed to date.

I think the APM overall competitive landscape is heating up. And part of that is because, certainly, Forrester and Gartner and a number of others, IDC, a number of others have talked about the dramatic increase in requests that they're getting around performance management consolidation, not just in data center but across cloud virtualization mobile technologies. We thought this was going to happen a couple of years ago, which is why declared a major error. And sure enough, it's created a response. And there are 2 kind of responses that we're seeing in the field. Number one is certainly the kind of thing that we would expect to see from a larger player. So BMC, recognizing the opportunity for growth, has jumped in. We applaud that. We think it's a great move. I think it helps validate the technologies and solutions that are being offered there today. Coradiant offers up a -- quite a subset of what we deliver inside the data center, and I think it's healthy for the category, overall, and create more visibility for everybody in that space. We also are watching. In the web-based world, there are opportunities for smaller companies to grow rapidly. And while they don't present any kind of threat from a material revenue or earnings growth, they certainly do represent opportunities of new kinds of technologies to be introduced, and they go viral. While we haven't seen anything dramatic yet, we're certainly watching across the board, to see if any of those players become of interest to us. So that's that. I think you'll see a continued acceleration of APM, certainly, in the next 2 to 3 years and probably longer. And that's why we're sort of upping the game, both organically and with some potential acquisitions later on. In the Mainframe space, again, there's a lot of moving parts. We've got the zSeries that's been out. Certainly, the 34% growth in IBM announced numbers last quarter in MIPS is, on the surface, good news, but a lot of that MIPS is simply replacing existing MIPS on the floor. And so, you'll see how that goes. What we are seeing with the comeback of the economy, although very slow, there is some capacity being released now. And certainly, we continue to expect to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Having said that, again, the concert of that, there are some small and medium businesses that are moving up to Mainframe, and I think most cloud-based initiatives, which represent new opportunities for us that will most likely not be mainframe-based. Some are, but most not, and so we'll see some pressure in the Mainframe side from that, also."

So on the expense side, we get overweight a little bit by the size of the Professional Services group and the supporting of that function. And so that's why traditionally, those numbers tend to build up on the G&A side. And then the way in which, and I'll let Laura comment, if she wants to, but the way in which we do the allocations obviously versus other companies might be a little bit different, leading towards a high G&A number. But overall, there's not much to do as far as restructuring goes moving forward.

Compuware growth drivers' outperformance is clear in '11, poised for continued acceleration in fiscal year '12. Compuware earned $0.48 per share in the fiscal year '11, $0.16 per share in Q4. Fiscal year '11 APM license and subscription fees skyrocket 91.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis to $145.5 million. License and subscription fees up 34.1% on a pro forma basis. Fiscal year '11 Covisint revenues slipped 36% year-over-year to $55 million. Final Q4 results, APM license fees and subscriptions up 54%, Covisint revenue up 65.6%, Uniface license fees up 76.7%, Changepoint license fees up 14.3% year-over-year, Professional Services segment contribution margin over 15%. 
Fiscal year '12 guidance predicts ongoing revenue growth, increased EPS and strong cash flow. Compuware Corporation, the technology performance company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Compuware increased its total revenues, software license fees, maintenance and subscription fees and professional services fees year-over-year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $487 million, up from $456.3 million in the previous year. Software license fees were $194.7 million compared to $194.5 million in the previous year. Professional Services fees were $247.2 million, up from $241.3 million in the previous year. 
Fiscal year 2011 revenues were $928.9 million, up from $892.2 million in the previous year. GAAP net income was $107.4 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $140.8 million GAAP and $93.7 million pro forma in fiscal year 2010. GAAP earnings per share were $0.48 in fiscal year '11 compared to $0.60 GAAP and $0.40 pro forma in fiscal year '10, based upon 226.1 million and 234.6 million shares outstanding, respectively. 
Fiscal year 2010 net income and earnings per share benefited from a nonrecurring $52.4 million gain from the divestiture of certain product lines and $20.7 million in other income related to a legal settlement.
During the company's fourth quarter, software license fees were $55.7 million, up from $51.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Maintenance and subscription fees were $124 million in the fourth quarter, up from $117.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue from Professional Services in the fourth quarter was $69.9 million, up from $60.3 million in the same quarter last year. During the fourth quarter, total revenues were $249.6 million, up from $230 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $34.8 million compared to $37.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.16 compared to $0.16 last year, based upon 224.4 million and 228.7 million shares outstanding, respectively. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

With strong performances by our growth drivers leading the way, Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011. We met or exceeded our yearly guidance for EPS for growth in our APM business, for increased Covisint revenue and from improvemen",1854,"Thanks, Lisa. With strong performances by our growth drivers leading the way, Compuware produced a positive fiscal year 2011. We met or exceeded our yearly guidance for EPS for growth in our APM business, for increased Covisint revenue and from improvements in Professional Service margins. In addition, both Uniface and Changepoint solutions showed increases in year-over-year license fees, while Professional Services returned to year-over-year revenue growth in Q4. In the year ahead, we expect accelerated growth by our APM and Covisint business units, as well as ongoing strong profitability and revenue growth from Professional Services, Uniface and Changepoint solutions. We also see a more positive mainframe environment in fiscal year '12. 
We believe we will post an approximately 10% increase in total revenue in fiscal year '12. We will achieve this by accelerating our investments in APM and Covisint, complemented with continued operational improvements in the rest of our business units. 
We are witnessing strong category growth and, therefore, extraordinary opportunities over the next few years in performance management and SaaS-based collaboration. To guarantee our leadership positions in both markets, it makes business sense to strike while the iron is hot. Our increased investments will have minimal impact on EPS for fiscal year '12, as there will be return on these investments during the fiscal year that will offset the expenses. The revenue growth from results in margin expansion from these investments will be dramatic in fiscal year '13 and '14. 
On the APM side, these investments will include acceleration of the internationalized portal platform, acceleration of mobile performance solutions and development of predictive analytics engines. For Covisint, these investments will include a performance-based health information exchange solution, sales expansion into more geographies and new vertical industry initiatives. 
Overall this year, we expect to produce approximately $1.02 billion in revenue and GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.57 per share, a year-over-year EPS increase of 10% to 19%. In Q1, we expect $0.05 to $0.07 in earnings per share, reflecting normal seasonality of our business. 
Obviously, we feel confident about these businesses due to our great success last year. In fiscal year '11, we projected APM license growth of more than 20% and SaaS revenue was $65 million. We surpassed these goals by delivering more than 30% increase in license fees and subscription revenues of nearly $68 million. Building on that success, we expect an at least 35% increase in combined APM new license and subscription fees in fiscal year '12. Nearly half of our APM business will be SaaS-based. And with our integrated sales team, we expect to see improvement across all key sales metrics: pipeline, close ratios and sales repeals [ph]. 
We have staked out a differentiated solution in the market, and customers are responding. I recently spoke with a CIO of a large financial institution. He has more than 100 monitoring tools to keep his most important applications working, applications that quite literally cost millions of dollars per hour of downtime. What Compuware offers is enterprise, and any company that depends on web, mobile or enterprise applications is broad visibility, deep-dive analytics and the simplicity of one solution to do it all. 
So this CIO can simplify their portfolio of tools and get the market's only capabilities for optimizing the performance of important applications from the data center, to the cloud, to the edge of the Internet on the user's mobile device. That's a compelling value proposition. And customers worldwide are absolutely demanding this capability to manage application performance from the end-user perspective. 
In this new competitive landscape, Compuware has both the first-mover advantage and the most complete solution. We believe, and it's backed up by industry analysts, that the APM market space addressable by our solutions could be as much as $6 billion in the coming years and growing, and our long-term goal is to own 40% of this market. To achieve this goal, we will capitalize our competitive advantages to deliver rapid organic growth. We may also augment our capabilities and market share through acquisitions. 
In the meantime, we continue to deliver market-changing APM releases. We recently completed our second integrated launch of Compuware Gomez, which followed our May 10 release of First Mile. Our rollout of First Mile to the retail vertical has produced a very positive market response, many new customers and a healthy pipeline of active opportunities. First Mile is designed to rapidly demonstrate our value proposition, opening accounts to our on-premise APM solutions. We are, therefore, focusing First Mile entirely on either greenfield or SaaS-only-based accounts. First Mile will drive material revenue contribution this fiscal year.
Trends in mobility, virtualization and cloud computing continue to benefit Compuware. Complexity in IT requires simplicity in solutions. It creates demand for our differentiated value proposition today, visibility across the entire application delivery chain that also sets us up for greater growth in the future. Long term, Compuware's visionary roadmap will not only provide visibility and deep-dive analytics, which remain critical, but we will also eliminate the overwhelming data smog that surrounds many APM tools. We are serving up the data that is most pertinent, actionable and important, saving people time and making them money. The value and simplicity we offer revolutionizes distributed APM, just as Compuware have [indiscernible], many years ago, revolutionized mainframe fault management. 
Joining APM on a rapid growth path, Covisint continues to expand and mature its business. In fiscal year 2011, Covisint increased its year-over-year revenues nearly 36% to $55 million. Based on this growth rate, which we expect to accelerate in the year ahead, we believe a partial carve-out IPO for Covisint could happen sometime this fiscal year. Our threshold for executing this program will be $1 billion valuation. 
The healthcare space continue to produce big wins for Covisint, and agreements in Vermont and Montana has shown us that the health information exchange market is evolving toward a strong focus on outcomes-based care. We are already leading the market with strong references of large healthcare systems becoming accountable care organizations. With a combination of our patient-quality reporting initiative capabilities and our secured collaboration platform, Covisint is firmly taking advantage of the rapid growth in this space.
PQRI payments or the patient quality reporting initiative are seasonal and provided a tailwind to Q4 results. Those incentives will go down in Q1, which will result in a modest sequential decrease in Q1 revenues for Covisint, though they will continue to increase on a year-over-year basis, as we will see the same bump next year. 
By segment, Covisint is now 40% healthcare, 40% manufacturing and 20% emerging sectors. We are starting to see signs that the multienterprise collaboration is becoming a defined category, and we look forward to discussing nonvertical Fortune 50 deals this quarter -- next quarter. There are no guerilla competitors in any of Covisint's vertical markets. We're competing and winning against systems integrators or traditional tools that lack the flexibility, agility and pricing advantages of our cloud-based model. Based on these market conditions and our competitive differentiation, we believe Covisint will produce an over 40% increase in revenues this year.
In addition to these growth engines, partners remain a critical focus in fiscal year '12. Partner and distributor-owned or influenced transactions approached $50 million in fiscal year '11. This year, our target is over $100 million. We intend to achieve that goal by expanding our relationships with Tier 1 partners like Cisco and Accenture and by strong focus on the managed service provider space. 
Compuware has entered into a first of its kind strategic OEM agreement with Cisco data center business unit. Through this agreement, we will standardize on the Cisco unified computing system platform for delivering Compuware Gomez solutions to customers. In turn, this will create new opportunities for us to engage with the Cisco team to identify new prospects and to enable partner-driven sales. 
We have also entered a formal alliance with Accenture to resell Compuware products suites. This alliance produced several wins in the fiscal year '11, including our largest APM transaction. We expect this partnership will continue to produce large wins in fiscal year '12. 
Our APM solutions offer compelling value propositions in the managed service providers. By helping MSPs deliver better services to their customers. We grew our MSP business by 30% in fiscal year '11 with partners like Verizon, British Telecom, Cable and Wireless and Atos Origin, and we'll continue to provide big opportunities for growth in the MSP space this year.
In the Mainframe Solutions area, we expect to soon close the 2 deals that slipped out of Q4. We plan to close the agreement with a large financial institution this quarter, and we believe we will complete our agreement with the federal government sometime in Q2. Beyond this deal, the federal budget dynamics are not impacting our business. 
We feel more optimistic about the Mainframe business in fiscal year '12. This year's renewal pipeline for agreements of more than $500,000 is 17% larger than last year's, which presents strong opportunities for footprint expansion. We succeed in such renewal scenarios because we have strong relationships around the value of our products that we deliver.  
This is a key focus for Mainframe Solutions business unit this year, maintaining and expanding our footprint by demonstrably proving our value. This is an extremely important market, and the competitors will continue to try to attack purchasing agents with cheap knock-offs. Compuware has been and is a recognized value and technology leader in this space. And with our ever-strengthening ability to represent customized return on investment information, we'll continue to win against less capable offers. Given these dynamics, we expect the total Mainframe revenues to be flat to low single-digit decline in the fiscal year '12.
Over the last 2 years, our Professional Services business has achieved a remarkable reinvention. We achieved our primary goal of services in fiscal year '11, a dramatically improved margin. Our focus on high-margin, high-value work has also resulted in our first return to quarterly revenue growth in services since fiscal 2001. 
Leaving our staff supplementation of low margins to others, we bring highly skilled technicians to bear on some of our customers' most pressing technology problems. In the year ahead, we expect to produce Professional Services segment revenue growth between 5% and 10%. Our proven skill in mobile and cloud application development, driven to our mobile center of excellence and global delivery organization, will fuel this growth. We expect this increase in revenue and our continued focus on margin management will push our core Professional Services margins toward 20%. 
We achieved great success last year, and the entire Compuware team has eagerly started to build on that success in fiscal year '12. With our new business unit structure, we're taking our competitive advantage in key markets and are racing to capitalize on them. This structure has empowered our lines of business to respond quickly to market conditions and competitive opportunities. This is a fast, efficient and entrepreneurial model that positions us for an outstanding year. The Compuware team is absolutely unified and energized around this goal, and we're working hard already to make it a reality. Laura?"

Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved great results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. Oper",644,"Thanks, Bob. Fiscal year '11 was a very successful year for Compuware. It was a year in which we achieved great results, particularly in relation to our growth vehicles, while making measurable progress in the overall transformation of our company. 
Operating cash flow for Q4 came in at a very strong $124.3 million, and we finished the year with a total of $160 million. As I mentioned on the precall, operating cash flow for the year was negatively impacted by lower accounts receivable collections primarily in the Mainframe segment. While operating cash flow for the year is lighter than we originally anticipated, we remain in a strong cash position with no outstanding debt.
As for operating expenses. For fiscal year '11, we had $779 million in total operating expenses. This is below our original guidance, as we effectively managed costs while still investing to support our growth. I did want to make one note about the total number of bottom expenses though on our Application Services, our Covisint segment. On our fact sheet, we do note that the margin is about 2.3%. 
One thing that did affect that margin is we recorded a catch-up adjustment of about $1.9 million for compensation expense related to stock options. And without that adjustment, our Application Services margin would have been 11.2%. Just one little note there. But going forward in fiscal year '12, we will continue to practice disciplined expense management to optimize our operating margin, while being mindful of the necessary investments needed to drive our top line in fiscal year '12 and beyond.
Fiscal year '12 operating expenses are expected to be approximately $825 million to $840 million. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our investments in the APM and Covisint business units to take advantage of the incredible market opportunities for these 2 segments. These investments will primarily be in the sales and technology groups.
And for fiscal year '12, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $160 million to $175 million. This estimate again reflects the targeted investments in our business units. With regard to the stock buyback in Q4, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for about $45 million. That brings our total repurchases for fiscal year '11 to approximately 17 million shares for nearly $161 million. Currently, we have approximately 219 million shares outstanding. In terms of future buyback activity, we will continue to evaluate business and economic conditions and buy back stock when it's fiscally prudent to do so.
Lastly, our effective tax rate for fiscal year '11 was approximately 31%, while the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%. This artificially low rate in Q4 was primarily due to an increase in tax credits related to the U.S. research and experimentation tax credit, including the impact of retroactively reinstating the credit to January 1, 2010, and the settlement of R&D credits related to fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 tax periods with the Internal Revenue Service.
For fiscal year '12, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 34% for the entire year. This rate is below the normal expectation of 36% due to changes in the Michigan income tax that are expected to be final very soon. Assuming this legislation is passed, our effective tax rate for the first quarter will be less than 20%, as it will reflect the benefit of the Michigan tax changes. Subsequently, we expect our effective tax rate to return to 36% for quarters 2, 3 and 4. 
Fiscal year '11 was an extremely solid year for Compuware, in which we witnessed robust growth in our APM and Covisint businesses, continued stability in our very important Mainframe maintenance base and resurgence in our Professional Services, Changepoint and Uniface businesses. In fiscal year '12, we will build on the successes as we strive to fulfill our substantial potential. Lisa?"

So if we're going to do that, I think we're going to see the returns in revenue on those areas towards the end of the year, but we may incur some of those expenses in the first 2 quarter. So just to be on the safe side, I think $160 million, $175 million is very safe. And we're certainly, as Mainframe is a strong year, we will probably see increases."

And we want to take advantage of expected growth there, also, in that category. So we’re accelerating investments there. And then honestly, in our very strong initiative to simplify all the massive amounts of data out there, inside the data center and beyond, doing more in the predictive analytics area to really break open the differentiation. I would also want to point out one thing. Last Thursday, we had a pretty robust board meeting. And under direction of the Board and our Chairman, it was determined that the opportunity in front of us, given the category growth and our position and space, was something where we really wanted to maximize our opportunities. So as a result of the request, the specific request from the Board, we have decided to move a lot of these investments up earlier in this year, and even from next fiscal year into this year, to make sure that we are taking advantage of what right now is an extremely hot category, whether you look at it in our terms or general market conditions.

So the 2 initial majors, the implementations have gotten very well. We've got a nice ROI that we're building upon. And because of the success, we're being taken into other areas of the business, not just upstream but downstream. I will also mention, there's a couple of comments I made on this in my formal remarks, but we're starting to see a trend in multienterprise collaboration, starting to move towards a more mature category. We're getting requests from some of the largest household brand-name companies to come in and solve problems outside of our traditional verticals. And while we're not sure if this is sort of early-traditional or early-adopter pool or if a category is really forming, becoming more mainstream, we're paying very, very close attention to that. Obviously, this will be all incremental to potential -- or the guidance and the business plan that we formed to date.

I think the APM overall competitive landscape is heating up. And part of that is because, certainly, Forrester and Gartner and a number of others, IDC, a number of others have talked about the dramatic increase in requests that they're getting around performance management consolidation, not just in data center but across cloud virtualization mobile technologies. We thought this was going to happen a couple of years ago, which is why declared a major error [ph]. And sure enough, it's created a response. And there are 2 kind of responses that we're seeing in the field. Number one is certainly the kind of thing that we would expect to see from a larger player. So BMC, recognizing the opportunity for growth, has jumped in. We applaud that. We think it's a great move. I think it helps validate the technologies and solutions that are being offered there today. Coradiant offers up a -- quite a subset of what we deliver inside the data center, and I think it's healthy for the category, overall, and create more visibility for everybody in that space. We also are watching. In the web-based world, there are opportunities for smaller companies to grow rapidly. And while they don't present any kind of threat from a material revenue or earnings growth, they certainly do represent opportunities of new kinds of technologies to be introduced, and they go viral. While we haven't seen anything dramatic yet, we're certainly watching across the board, to see if any of those players become of interest to us. So that's that. I think you'll see a continued acceleration of APM, certainly, in the next 2 to 3 years and probably longer. And that's why we're sort of upping the game, both organically and with some potential acquisitions later on. In the Mainframe space, again, there's a lot of moving parts. We've got the zSeries that's been out. Certainly, the 34% growth in IBM announced numbers last quarter in MIPS is, on the surface, good news, but a lot of that MIPS is simply replacing existing MIPS on the floor. And so, you'll see how that goes. What we are seeing with the comeback of the economy, although very slow, there is some capacity being released now. And certainly, we continue to expect to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Having said that, again, the concert of that, there are some small and medium businesses that are moving up to Mainframe, and I think most cloud-based initiatives, which represent new opportunities for us that will most likely not be mainframe-based. Some are, but most not, and so we'll see some pressure in the Mainframe side from that, also."

And then the way in which, and I'll let Laura comment, if she wants to, but the way in which we do the allocations obviously versus other companies might be a little bit different, leading towards a high G&A number.

This drives greater agility, which especially important in quickly changing market conditions. It also means our management team and our investors can easily evaluate the execution of these part of the business and quickly understand its overall contribution to Compuware success. To extend this transparency we will now use a consistent format on this calls to discuss quarterly business results. 
First, we'll offer our perspective on total numbers of the quarter. Next, we'll discuss the performance of these business unit including revenues, margin, key achievements and important trends. 
Following the business unit discussion will cover one-time issues and will close with guidance. This format consistent with Compuware's new organizational structure will provide the most information for our investors in the clearest way possible and we welcome your feedback. 
Furthermore, for each of our business units, we are competing detailed 3 year financial on solution based business plans. This process is a next natural step of the transformation we embarked upon 3 years ago. 
Joe Angileri, who recently joined us as President and COO, and brings decades of financial and business consulting experience will help us drive this effort. Joe is working with me and our leadership team to be completed by our total board meeting. We look forward to sharing this plans with you on a detailed Investor Day in New York on November 10th. 
I believe the 3 year plans will provide you with the insight to clearly evaluate our performance, which includes delivering long-term and consistent increases in revenues and margins. We will update these plants on a continuous process and will use them as a backbone for which the measured impact of any onetime events or changing market conditions. 
I look forward to Joe contributing on future earnings call on this project and it'll exciting to have him accelerate our journey towards operational excellence. 
For the first quarter ended June 30th, Compuware posted positive results with total revenues up 11.4% from Q1 last year to $230 million. Net income was $17 million, our 34.3% from Q1 last year. Earnings per share were $0.08, up from $0.06 per share in Q1 last year. 
As you will hear on our business unit details, strong contributors to our success in Q1 were Mainframe and license, Gomez Bass platform, Professional Services, Covisint and maintenance. Geographically, we saw particularly strong results for APM in Europe, and for Mainframe in North America. 
Beginning with the Mainframe business unit, Q1 revenues were $97.5 million with a 75% contribution margin in Q1. The profitability of this business unit continues to provide fuel for Compuware to invest in its growth engines. 
As you remember, two significant Mainframe deals slipped out of Q4 last year, the smaller these delas the financial agreement closed in Q1. As expected, the large government agency deals are on track to close in Q2. We see little change in the competitive environment for Mainframe Solutions. With the restructuring of our Mainframe sales team, we're actually starting to see net new business pipeline growth. That's a winning combination for our customers, our investors and for Compuware. 
As mentioned previously, 6 of our top 15 accounts are up for renewal this year. We achieved 92% renewal rate in Q1, which were the same as last year's Q1. Last fiscal year, the overall renewal rates were 93%, but we don't expect any changes to that rate this year. 
The value we're with skilled people and scalable programs is ensuring consistency in renewal rates and in our pricing. The APM business unit delivered $35.5 million in revenue and a contribution margin of 25% in Q1. This represents an 18.5% growth in revenue over last year. Contribution margin was impacted by an acceleration of technology investments. 
The Compuware Gomez SaaS solution had a particularly strong quarter with subscription revenues leaping 40.6% from Q1 last year to $18.7 million. The APM on premise solution did decline in revenue, but from the on premise solution, we saw 16% jump in new logos over the prior year. 
As the growth business, our strategic plan for the APM business unit is to invest now to quickly achieve market dominance in the growing $6 billion segment of the category. 
Our action plan for achieving this position is simple: First, we'll continue to offer best in class products to solve painful and expensive point from problems related to the poor performance of key web, non-web mobile and cloud applications. 
Today's buying behavior to buy point solutions and we are winning with our best and great offering in business transaction monitoring, agent less and web performance solutions. But the way companies are buying today won't solve the problem tomorrow. CIOs and as business leaders are fighting data smog. Too much data and 2Q answers for failing application in a world of growing IT complexity. 
These organizations are increasingly ready to embrace a single platform that cuts through the complexity exactly identifies the problem and provide answers they need. To bring this solution to market worldwide, we are making targeted investments in our APM business unit, specifically, we continue to invest in our global portal, with specific focus on ease-of-use, time to value and data analytics. 
In mobile application performance capability, and in video streaming performance. These investments match some of the hottest technology trends in the market that will position Compuware as the leader in tehse segments. 
The first mile solution is a key part of this investment roadmap, as it is the first production instance of a cloud, Web and data center metrics in the consolidated dashboard. In a limited release in major retailers, we are in 73 active evaluations today. 
Success rates will only improve as more capability is added to the supplies. Finally, our dynaTrace acquisition represents a critical investment in extending our APM leadership. DynaTrace is recognize as the best in class in segments of the APM market, especially in Java and dot net environments. The ability to continuously track business transaction through dynaTrace's patented PurePath technology and provide exact identification of performance is game changing this segment, but will also have a powerful level of visibility to the global SaaS base portal. 
On July 19th, less than 3 weeks after the acquisition, we introduced the initial integration of Compuware Gomez and dynaTrace. We have also already developed a share roadmap for future interoperability. 
Training our field face of teams has begun and most sales and presales -- most training for sales and presales will have completed their phase one certification by mid-August. 
This will allow our global APM sales team to sell our entire APM portfolio including dynaTrace. While the dynaTrace team remains focused in this fiscal year that's offering. In both our due diligence to research since we've finally have found similar buyer types, who are over that same organization. Reporting them to shared economic sponsor. This is great news. We've increased our points of entry and our addressable market but with buyers we know and there's problems we understand. DynaTrace is already running ahead of its annual goal and the annualized run rate for the end of our fiscal year should be approximately $38 million. The existing Compuware sales force should be able to add another $15 million for the remaining 9 months or $20 million annualized, bringing the run rate up to $58 million. 
Even conservatively, if we plan on the growth rate of 70%, which is down from the existing 125% growth rate, we get to just under $100 million in fiscal year '13. We have this plan mapped by sales organization, geography and channels group. 
We would need to do about 300 total deals across our sales and direct and channels organization to achieve this number, which is quite feasible. 
The -- organization continues to contribute significantly to the company's success. Particularly that of the APM business unit. We are quickly broadening and deepening relationship with strategic partners with the goal of delivering $50 million and incremental as revenue this fiscal year and another $50 million in partner influence deals. 
Here are just a few examples. In Q1, we launched no go to market plan with the Cisco field organization and partners particularly around our combined solution for APM and the Cisco unified computing system. Cisco teams have been trained on the solution and specific high-value accounts have been targeted. Key systems signed a match that rate for all Compuware products in Q1. We received the first two orders based on this agreement within a week of signing. 
We're also building on our partnership with British Telecom, which in Q1, agreed to train 100 of its solution consultants around the world on the Compuware APM Solution. Other partnerships that deliver increased performance this quarter includes sadness, Apple's origin, CSE, Logica, Accenture, and others. 
The Compuware Professional Services business unit had a very strong Q1. Taking advantage of increasing demand for mobile application development and other leading technologies. The business unit produced revenue of $39.9 million at a contribution margin of 20.8%. I believe we can continue to grow on this trajectory through expanding competencies in cloud and mobile application development work. 
The Covisint business unit also had an outstanding quarter with 43.8% increase in revenues year-over-year. Covisint delivered $16.2 million of revenue at a contribution margin of negative 4.1% in Q1. Covisint's margin will breakthrough in the continuous positive ground next quarter. 
Covisint market velocity is incredible. More than $11 million unique users log on to the Covisint network this quarter. The 300% increase from this previous quarter. 
Healthcare revenue grew nearly 52% of the non-healthcare business increased revenue of 39.2% year-over-year, as a member of large accounts came online. The auto segment has also been rejuvenated. The evolution of the connected vehicle, the different ways in which consumers now interact with their vehicles, generates a great amount for security, and anytime, anywhere access that only Covisint delivers. 
In the healthcare vertical, we signed 5 new deals with hospital-based accountable care organizations in Q1. New Medicaid reimbursement models requires strong outcome that's reporting along with a secured sharing of information. Our combination of a highly secured cloud-based platform and tools for population analysis across the community uniquely position us in this market. 
Covisint partnership with AT&T and AMA are also delivering results. We signed 2 large care coordination agreements with AT&T in the quarter, including one at houses them in Texas, one of the largest houses in the country. 
The AMA this quarter through its subsidiary is rolling out Covisint across the country starting with the next platform being implemented through the Connecticut Medical Society. 
We receive many questions regarding the potential IPO and expect evaluation numbers. Our guidance has been Covisint should achieve $80 million of revenue this year. With the visibility we now have in the subscription model and the continued momentum, we now believe we should surpass this guidance. 
If we were to file an S-1 this fall, and completely IPO next spring, the valuation used for Covisint will be based on calendar year 13 numbers. According to potential book writers of the current growth rate, this would put the valuation at around $1 billion. 
The Covisint competitive environment is largely unchanged. We compete primarily with large integrators like Cap Gemini, IBM Global Services. We win because our SaaS platform offers less risk and faster return. 
The new base business unit produced than $10.9 million in revenue in Q1 with a contribution margin of 50.6%. Interface remains strong and position to take advantage of macro trends in application development that demand speed and flexibility. We are seeing growth and opportunities in developing multi-tenant cloud-based apps. 
The Changepoint business unit achieved $10 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 14% in Q1. Our strong focus on professional services automation continues to show promise for more sustained success in the coming quarters. 
Moving onto guidance. Compuware's reaffirming projection of $0.50 to $0.54 in GAAP earnings per share for the full year. This reflects the purchase accounting impact of the dynaTrace acquisition, as we detailed on July 6th. We continue to expect revenue for the fiscal year at or near $1.06 billion. 
In Q2, we believe earnings per share will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.10. So a good start. To the fastest growing SaaS base businesses in a high-growth categories, and healthy and mature mainframe professional service organizations, and strong strategic outlook, greater operational discipline, and more transparency forthcoming. 
We're looking forward to a great year. Laura?"

Operating cash flow for the first quarter came in at $15.2 million. And for the year, we continue to forecast operating cash flow coming in at $160 million to $175 million, which reflects the targeted investments at our business unit. 
Q1 operating expenses were $210.4 million, slightly higher than anticipated. The weakening of the U.S. dollar fuel this increase with currency impacting total operating expenses by approximately $7 million. 
Looking forward, in addition to any currency impact, our fiscal year '12 operating expenses will increase for the acquisition of dynaTrace by about $45.5 million. Total operating expenses for the year are now expected to be between $870 million and $885 million. 
In addition, interest expense related to the purchase of dynaTrace is expected to be approximately $2.2 million for fiscal '12. 
As always, expense management is one of our top priorities and we will continue to work diligently across the organization to identify potential areas of savings and leverage efficiencies while continuing to support our growth vehicles through targeted investments. 
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q1, we did not repurchase any shares temporarily suspending the program in light of the dynaTrace acquisition. 
As we mentioned on our dynaTrace acquisition conference call, we've expanded our line of credit to $200 million to complete the $256 million acquisition. Of that $200 million, we expect to borrow less than $150 million at an approximate 2% interest rate. Taking into account the debt and the fact that we are now in our lighter cash flow months of the fiscal year, we have no immediate plans to repurchase stocks. 
However, by September, we should be in a position to reevaluate the situation. Lastly, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 17.6%, the lower rate was primarily due to the impact of the latest Michigan Tax Legislation enacted in the first quarter. In Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% dropping 38% in the third and fourth quarters. 
For fiscal '12, the net effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 36%. As you can imagine, this is a very exciting time at Compuware as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and capitalize on our tremendous opportunity, Q1 was a very positive step along the path. Lisa?"

Because of buying behaviors, we found out pretty quickly this is back in February time frame. Tremendous amount of excitement but they want to have everything to drive that dashboard both inside the data center and outside the web. So we've been building furiously the capabilities on top of that platform. We would expect to be in the single digits for millions of dollars this fiscal year. Because again, we've got a limited focus and a single target market that we're allowing. At the point that we get to it, 10 or higher, it fuels about the right track hold but will see. We've been think will have enough reference ability to drive that solution into our global sales force.

Compuware's new business unit structure gives us much better visibility and control over the business. This drives greater agility, which is especially important in quickly changing market conditions. It also means our management team and our investors can easily evaluate the execution of each part of the business and quickly understand its overall contribution to Compuware's success. To extend this transparency we will now use a consistent format on this calls to discuss quarterly business results. 
First, we'll offer our perspective on the total numbers of the quarter. Next, we'll discuss the performance of these business unit, including revenues, margin, key achievements and important trends. Following the business unit discussion, we'll cover onetime issues and we'll close with guidance. This format, consistent with Compuware's new organizational structure, will provide the most information for our investors in the clearest way possible, and we welcome your feedback. Furthermore, for each of our business units, we are competing detailed 3-year financial on solution-based business plans. This process is a natural step of the transformation we embarked upon 3 years ago. 
Joe Angileri, who recently joined us as President and COO and brings decades of financial and business consulting experience, will help drive this effort. Joe is working with me and our leadership team to complete it by our October board meeting. We look forward to sharing these plans with you on a detailed Investor Day in New York on November 10th. I believe the 3-year plans will provide you with the insight to clearly evaluate our performance, which includes delivering long-term and consistent increases in revenues and margins. We will update these plans as a continuous process and will use them as a backbone from which to measure the impact of any onetime events or changing market conditions. I look forward to Joe contributing in future earnings call on this project, and it'll be exciting to have him accelerate our journey towards operational excellence. 
For this first quarter ended June 30th, Compuware posted positive results with total revenues up 11.4% from Q1 last year to $230 million. Net income was $17 million, up 34.3% from Q1 last year. Earnings per share were $0.08, up from $0.06 per share in Q1 last year. 
As you will hear on our business unit details, strong contributors to our success in Q1 were Mainframe and license, Gomez SaaS platform, Professional Services, Covisint and Maintenance. Geographically, we saw particularly strong results for APM in Europe and for Mainframe in North America. 
Beginning with the Mainframe business unit, Q1 revenues were $97.5 million with a 75% contribution margin in Q1. The profitability of this business unit continues to provide the fuel for Compuware to invest in its growth engines. 
As you remember, 2 significant Mainframe deals slipped out of Q4 last year, the smaller of these deals, the financial services agreement, closed in Q1. As expected, the large government agency deals are on track to close in Q2. We see little change in the competitive environment for Mainframe Solutions. With the restructuring of our Mainframe sales team, we're actually starting to see net new business pipeline growth. That's a winning combination for our customers, our investors and for Compuware. 
As mentioned previously, 6 of our top 15 accounts are up for renewal this year. We achieved 92% renewal rates in Q1, which were the same as last year's Q1. Last fiscal year, the overall renewal rates were 93%, but we don't expect any changes to that rate this year. 
The value we're offering with skilled people and scalable programs is ensuring consistency in renewal rates and in our pricing. The APM business unit delivered $55.5 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 25% in Q1. This represents an 18.5% growth in revenue over last year. Contribution margin was impacted by an acceleration of technology investments. 
The Compuware Gomez SaaS solution had a particularly strong quarter with subscription revenues leaping 40.6% from Q1 last year to $18.7 million. The APM on-premise solution did decline in revenue, but for the on-premise solution, we saw a 16% jump in new logos over the prior year. 
As a growth business, our strategic plan for the APM business unit is to invest now to quickly achieve market dominance in the growing $6 billion segment of the category. Our action plan for achieving this position is simple. First, we'll continue to offer best-in-class products to solve painful and expensive point from problems related to the poor performance of key web, non-web mobile and cloud applications. 
Today's buying behavior to buy point solutions and we are winning with our best and great offerings in business transaction monitoring, agentless and web performance solutions. But the way companies buy today won't solve the problem tomorrow. CIOs and a lot of business leaders are fighting data smog, too much data and too few answers for failing applications in a world of growing IT complexity. 
These organizations are increasingly ready to embrace a single platform that cuts through the complexity and exactly identifies the problem and provides the answers they need. To bring this solution to market worldwide, we are making targeted investments in our APM business unit. Specifically, we continue to invest in our global portal, with specific focus on ease of use, time to value and data analytics in mobile application performance capabilities and in video streaming performance. These investments match some of the hottest technology trends in the market that will position Compuware as the leader in these segments. 
The First Mile solution is a key part of this investment roadmap, as it is the first production instance of a cloud, web and data center metrics in a consolidated dashboard. In a limited release to major retailers, we are in 73 active evaluations today. Success rates will only improve as more capability is added to the supplies. 
Finally, our dynaTrace acquisition represents a critical investment in extending our APM leadership. dynaTrace is recognized as the best in class in the segments of the APM market, especially in Java and dot-net environments. The ability to continuously track business transactions through dynaTrace's patented PurePath technology and provide exact identification of performance problems is game-changing this segment but will also have a powerful level of visibility to the global SaaS-based portal. 
On July 19th, less than 3 weeks after the acquisition, we introduced the initial integration of Compuware Gomez and dynaTrace. We have also already developed a share roadmap for future interoperability. 
Training our field-facing teams has begun, and most sales and presales -- most training for sales and presales will have completed their Phase 1 certification by mid-August. 
This will allow our global APM sales team to sell our entire APM portfolio, including dynaTrace, while the dynaTrace team remains focused on this fiscal year selling it's own offering. In both our due diligence and research ends, we finally have similar buyer types who are offered at different parts of the same organization, reporting them to a shared economic sponsor. This is great news. We've increased our points of entry and our addressable market but with buyers we know and with problems we understand. dynaTrace is already running ahead of its annual goal, and the annualized run rate for the end of our fiscal year should be approximately $38 million. The existing Compuware sales force should be able to add another $15 million for the remaining 9 months or $20 million annualized, bringing the run rate up to $58 million. 
Even conservatively, if we plan on the growth rate of 70%, which is down from the existing 125% growth rate, we get to just under $100 million in fiscal year '13. We have this plan mapped by sales organization, geography and channels group. We would need to do about 300 total deals across inside sales, direct and channels organization to achieve this number, which is quite feasible. 
The partners organization continues to contribute significantly to the company's success, particularly that of the APM business unit. We are quickly broadening and deepening our relationships with strategic partners with the goal of delivering $50 million in incremental partner-driven revenue this fiscal year and another $50 million in partner-influenced deals. 
Here are just a few examples. In Q1, we launched new go-to-market plan with the Cisco field organization and partners, particularly around our combined solution for APM and the Cisco-unified computing system. Cisco teams have been trained on the solution and specific high-value accounts have been targeted. Key systems (sic) [Keynote Systems] signed a mass statement of work framework for all Compuware products in Q1. We received the first 2 orders based on this agreement within a week of signing. 
We're also building on our partnership with British Telecom, which, in Q1, agreed to train 100 of its solution consultants around the world on the Compuware APM solution. Other partnerships that deliver increased performance this quarter includes SaaS, Atos Origin, CSC, Logica, Accenture, and others. 
The Compuware Professional Services business unit had a very strong Q1. Taking advantage of increasing demand for mobile application development and other leading technologies, the business unit produced revenue of $39.9 million at a contribution margin of 20.8%. I believe that we can continue to grow on this trajectory through expanding competencies in cloud and mobile application development work. 
The Covisint business unit also had an outstanding quarter with 43.8% increase in revenues year-over-year. Covisint delivered $16.2 million of revenue at a contribution margin of negative 4.1% in Q1. Covisint's margin will breakthrough in the continuous positive ground next quarter. Covisint's market velocity is incredible. More than $11 million unique users logged on to the Covisint network this quarter, a 300% increase from this previous quarter. 
Healthcare revenue grew nearly 52% of the non-healthcare business increased revenue of 39.2% year-over-year as a number of large accounts came online. 
The auto segment has also been rejuvenated. The evolution of the connected vehicle, the different ways in which consumers now interact with their vehicles, generates a great amount for the security and anytime, anywhere access that only Covisint delivers. 
In the healthcare vertical, we signed 5 new deals with hospital-based accountable care organizations in Q1. New Medicaid reimbursement models requires strong outcomes-based reporting, along with a secured sharing of information. Our combination of a highly secured cloud-based platform and tools for population analysis across the community uniquely position us in this market. 
Covisint's partnership with AT&T and AMA are also delivering results. We signed 2 large care coordination agreements with AT&T in the quarter, including one at Bailer [ph] house systems in Texas, one of the largest house systems in the country. The AMA this quarter, through its Imagine [ph] subsidiary, is rolling out Covisint across the country, starting with the next platform being implemented through the Connecticut Medical Society. 
We received many questions regarding the potential IPO and expected valuation numbers. Our guidance has been that Covisint should achieve $80 million of revenue this year. With the visibility we now have in the subscription model and the continued momentum, we now believe we should surpass this guidance. 
If we were to file an S-1 this fall, and complete the IPO next spring, the valuation used for Covisint will be based on calendar year '13 numbers. According to potential book writers of the current growth rate, this would put the valuation at around $1 billion. 
The Covisint competitive environment is largely unchanged. We compete primarily with large integrators like Cap Gemini, IBM Global Services. We win because our SaaS platform offers less risk and faster return. 
The Uniface business unit produced than $10.9 million in revenue in Q1 with a contribution margin of 50.6%. Uniface remains strong and positioned to take advantage of macrotrends in application development that demand speed and flexibility. We are seeing growth and opportunities in developing multitenant cloud-based apps. 
The Changepoint business unit achieved $10 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 14% in Q1. Our strong focus on professional services automation continues to show promise for more sustained success in the coming quarters. 
Moving on to guidance. Compuware is reaffirming projections of $0.50 to $0.54 in GAAP earnings per share for the full year. This reflects the purchase accounting impact of the dynaTrace acquisition, as we detailed on July 6th. We continue to expect revenue for the fiscal year at or near $1.06 billion. 
In Q2, we believe earnings per share will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.10, so a good start: two of the fastest-growing SaaS-based businesses in the high-growth categories, and healthy and mature Mainframe professional service organizations, the strong strategic outlook, greater operational discipline and more transparency forthcoming. We're looking forward to a great year. Laura?"

Operating cash flow for the first quarter came in at $15.2 million. And for the year, we continue to forecast operating cash flow coming in at $160 million to $175 million, which reflects the targeted investments in our business units. Q1 operating expenses were $210.4 million, slightly higher than anticipated. The weakening of the U.S. dollar fueled this increase with currency impacting total operating expenses by approximately $7 million. 
Looking forward, in addition to any currency impact, our fiscal year '12 operating expenses will increase for the acquisition of dynaTrace by about $45.5 million. Total operating expenses for the year are now expected to be between $870 million and $885 million. In addition, interest expense related to the purchase of dynaTrace is expected to be approximately $2.2 million for fiscal '12. 
As always, expense management is one of our top priorities and we will continue to work diligently across the organization to identify potential areas of savings and leverage efficiencies while continuing to support our growth vehicles through targeted investments. 
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q1, we did not repurchase any shares, temporarily suspending the program in light of the dynaTrace acquisition. As we mentioned on our dynaTrace acquisition conference call, we've expanded our line of credit to $200 million to complete the $256 million acquisition. Of that $200 million, we expect to borrow less than $150 million at an approximate 2% interest rate. Taking into account the debt and the fact that we are now in our lighter cash flow months of the fiscal year, we have no immediate plans to repurchase stocks. However, by September, we should be in a position to reevaluate the situation. 
Lastly, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 17.6%. The lower rate was primarily due to the impact of the latest Michigan Tax Legislation enacted in the first quarter. In Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%, dropping 38% in the third and fourth quarters. 
For fiscal '12, the net effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 36%. As you can imagine, this is a very exciting time at Compuware as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and capitalize on our tremendous opportunity. Q1 was a very positive step along the path. Lisa?"

So the strategy behind First Mile is that it was so disruptive that we knew that it wouldn't be a lot of budgets out there to change the way in which APM is being bought. And so we didn't want to give it to the global sales organization without a tremendous amount of reference ability accomplished and making sure that we have the right pricing strategies, support services and everything else that goes around the solution. So coming out of the gate, we have some key pieces of the web performance solution and some key pieces of the agentless technology built on the appliance. And because of buying behaviors, we found out pretty quickly, this is back in February time frame, tremendous amount of excitement but they want to have everything to drive that composite dashboard, both inside the data center and outside the web. So we've been building furiously the capabilities on top of that platform. We would expect to be in the single digits, millions of dollars this fiscal year. Because again, we've got a limited focus and a single target market that we're allowing. At the point that we get to a 10 or a higher. It feels about the right threshold, but we'll see. We're going to think we have enough reference ability to drive that solution into our global sales force. And we'll have the point specific -- I was getting a little bit on that strategy but we'll have a point-specific solutions if I've got the old buying behavior and the specific problem and the global composite solution which would be able to give me full enterprise visibility based upon business relevance, solving and getting into the nth level of detail with the exact problem. And so I would expect the next big move from that appliance is to release it to the general sales organization. I'm not in a position right now to really talk about when that's going to be. But obviously, we'll be disappointed if we didn't have it ready for next fiscal year."

Compuware's new business unit structure gives us much better visibility and control over the business. This drives greater agility, which is especially important in quickly changing market conditions. It also means our management team and our investors can easily evaluate the execution of each part of the business and quickly understand its overall contribution to Compuware's success. To extend this transparency we will now use a consistent format on these calls to discuss quarterly business results. 
First, we'll offer our perspective on the total numbers for the quarter. Next, we'll discuss the performance of these business unit, including revenues, margin, key achievements and important trends. Following the business unit discussion, we'll cover onetime issues and we'll close with guidance. This format, consistent with Compuware's new organizational structure, will provide the most information for our investors in the clearest way possible, and we welcome your feedback. Furthermore, for each of our business units, we are completing detailed 3-year financial on solution-based business plans. This process is a next natural step of the transformation we embarked upon 3 years ago. 
Joe Angileri, who recently joined us as President and COO and brings decades of financial and business consulting experience, will help drive this effort. Joe is working with me and our leadership team to complete it by our October board meeting. We look forward to sharing these plans with you on a detailed Investor Day in New York on November 10th. I believe the 3-year plans will provide you with the insight to clearly evaluate our performance, which includes delivering long-term and consistent increases in revenues and margins. We will update these plans as a continuous process and will use them as a backbone from which to measure the impact of any onetime events or changing market conditions. I look forward to Joe contributing in future earnings calls on this project, and it'll be exciting to have him accelerate our journey towards operational excellence. 
For it's first quarter ended June 30th, Compuware posted positive results with total revenues up 11.4% from Q1 last year to $230 million. Net income was $17 million, up 34.3% from Q1 last year. Earnings per share were $0.08, up from $0.06 per share in Q1 last year. 
As you will hear on our business unit details, strong contributors to our success in Q1 were Mainframe and license, Gomez SaaS platform, Professional Services, Covisint and Maintenance. Geographically, we saw particularly strong results for APM in Europe and for Mainframe in North America. 
Beginning with the Mainframe business unit, Q1 revenues were $97.5 million with a 75% contribution margin in Q1. The profitability of this business unit continues to provide the fuel for Compuware to invest in its growth engines. 
As you remember, 2 significant Mainframe deals slipped out Q4 last year, the smaller of these deals, the financial services agreement, closed in Q1. As expected, the large government agency deal is on track to close in Q2. We see little change in the competitive environment for Mainframe Solutions. With the restructuring of our Mainframe sales team, we're actually starting to see net new business pipeline growth. That's a winning combination for our customers, our investors and for Compuware. 
As mentioned previously, 6 of our top 15 accounts are up for renewal this year. We achieved 92% renewal rates in Q1, which were the same as last year's Q1. Last fiscal year, the overall renewal rates were 93%, but we don't expect any changes to that rate this year. 
The value we're offering with skilled people and scalable programs is ensuring consistency in renewal rates and in our pricing. The APM business unit delivered $55.5 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 25% in Q1. This represents an 18.5% growth in revenue over last year. Contribution margin was impacted by an acceleration of technology investments. 
The Compuware Gomez SaaS solution had a particularly strong quarter with subscription revenues leaping 40.6% from Q1 last year to $18.7 million. The APM on-premise solution did decline in revenue, but for the on-premise solution, we saw a 16% jump in new logos over the prior year. 
As a growth business, our strategic plan for the APM business unit is to invest now to quickly achieve market dominance in the growing $6 billion segment of the category. Our action plan for achieving this position is simple. First, we'll continue to offer best-in-class products to solve painful and expensive point problems related to the poor performance of key web, non-web mobile and cloud applications. 
Today's buying behavior is to buy point solutions and we are winning with our best of breed offerings in business transaction monitoring, agentless and web performance solutions. But the way companies buy today won't solve the problem tomorrow. CIOs and a lot of business leaders are fighting data smog, too much data and too few answers for failing applications in a world of growing IT complexity. 
These organizations are increasingly ready to embrace a single platform that cuts through the complexity and exactly identifies the problem and provides the answers they need. To bring this solution to market worldwide, we are making targeted investments in our APM business unit. Specifically, we continue to invest in our global portal, with specific focus on ease of use, time to value and data analytics in mobile application performance capabilities and in video streaming performance. These investments match some of the hottest technology trends in the market that will position Compuware as the leader in these segments. 
The First Mile solution is a key part of this investment roadmap, as it is the first production instance of a cloud, web and data center metrics in a consolidated dashboard. In a limited release to major retailers, we are in 73 active evaluations today. Success rates will only improve as more capability is added to the supplies. 
Finally, our dynaTrace acquisition represents a critical investment in extending our APM leadership. dynaTrace is recognized as the best in class in the segments of the APM market, especially in Java and dot-net environments. The ability to continuously track business transactions through dynaTrace's patented PurePath technology and provide exact identification of performance problems is game-changing this segment but will also add a powerful level of visibility to the global SaaS-based portal. 
On July 19th, less than 3 weeks after the acquisition, we introduced the initial integration of Compuware Gomez and dynaTrace. We have also already developed a share roadmap for future interoperability. 
Training our field-facing teams has begun, and most sales and presales -- most training for sales and presales will have completed their Phase 1 certification by mid-August. 
This will allow our global APM sales team to sell our entire APM portfolio, including dynaTrace, while the dynaTrace team remains focused on this fiscal year selling it's own offering. In both our due diligence and research since, we found we have similar buyer types who are often at different parts of the same organization, reporting them to a shared economic sponsor. This is great news. We've increased our points of entry and our addressable market but with buyers we know and whose problems we understand. dynaTrace is already running ahead of its annual goal, and the annualized run rate for the end of our fiscal year should be approximately $38 million. The existing Compuware sales force should be able to add another $15 million for the remaining 9 months or $20 million annualized, bringing the run rate up to $58 million. 
Even conservatively, if we plan on the growth rate of 70%, which is down from the existing 125% growth rate, we get to just under $100 million in fiscal year '13. We have this plan mapped out by sales organization, geography and channels group. We would need to do about 300 total deals across inside sales, direct and channel organization to achieve this number, which is quite feasible. 
The partners organization continues to contribute significantly to the company's success, particularly that of the APM business unit. We are quickly broadening and deepening our relationships with strategic partners with the goal of delivering $50 million in incremental partner-driven [ph] revenue this fiscal year and another $50 million in partner-influenced deals. 
Here are just a few examples. In Q1, we launched new go-to-market plans with the Cisco field organization and partners, particularly around our combined solution for APM and the Cisco-unified computing system. Cisco teams have been trained on the solution and specific high-value accounts have been targeted. Key systems (sic) [Keynote Systems] signed a massive statement of work framework for all Compuware products in Q1. We received the first 2 orders based on this agreement within a week of signing. 
We're also building on a partnership with British Telecom, which, in Q1, agreed to train 100 of its solution consultants around the world on the Compuware APM solution. Other partnerships that deliver increased performance this quarter includes SaaS, Atos Origin, CSC, Logica, Accenture, and others. 
The Compuware Professional Services business unit had a very strong Q1. Taking advantage of increasing demand for mobile application development and other leading technologies, the business unit produced revenue of $39.9 million at a contribution margin of 20.8%. I believe that we can continue to grow on this trajectory through expanding competencies in cloud and mobile application development work. 
The Covisint business unit also had an outstanding quarter with 43.8% increase in revenues year-over-year. Covisint delivered $16.2 million of revenue at a contribution margin of negative 4.1% in Q1. Covisint's margin will breakthrough into a continuous positive ground next quarter. Covisint's market velocity is incredible. More than 11 million unique users logged on to the Covisint network this quarter, a 300% increase from this previous quarter. 
Healthcare revenue grew nearly 52% of the non-healthcare business increased revenues 39.2% year-over-year as a number of large accounts came online. 
The auto segment has also been rejuvenated. The evolution of the connected vehicle, the different ways in which consumers now interact with their vehicles, generates great demand for the security and anytime, anywhere access that only Covisint delivers. 
In the healthcare vertical, we signed 5 new deals with hospital-based accountable care organizations in Q1. New Medicaid reimbursement models requires strong outcomes-based reporting, along with a secured sharing of information. Our combination of a highly secured cloud-based platform and tools for population analysis across the community uniquely position us in this market. 
Covisint's partnership with AT&T and AMA are also delivering results. We signed 2 large care coordination agreements with AT&T in the quarter, including one at Baylor Health Systems in Texas, one of the largest healthy systems in the country. The AMA this quarter, through its Amagine subsidiary, is rolling out Covisint across the country, starting with the next platform being implemented through the Connecticut Medical Society. 
We received many questions regarding a potential IPO and expected valuation numbers. Our guidance has been that Covisint should achieve $80 million in revenue this year. With the visibility we now have in the subscription model and the continued momentum, we now believe we should surpass this guidance. 
If we were to file an S-1 this fall, and complete the IPO next spring, the valuation used for Covisint would be based on calendar year '13 numbers. According to potential book writers of the current growth rate, this would put the valuation at around $1 billion. 
The Covisint competitive environment is largely unchanged. We compete primarily with large integrators like Cap Gemini, IBM Global Services. We win because our SaaS platform offers less risk and faster return. 
The Uniface business unit produced $10.9 million in revenue in Q1 with a contribution margin of 50.6%. Uniface remains strong and positioned to take advantage of macrotrends in application development that demand speed and flexibility. We are seeing growth and opportunities in developing multitenant cloud-based apps. 
The Changepoint business unit achieved $10 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 14% in Q1. Our strong focus on professional services automation continues to show promise for more sustained success in the coming quarters. 
Moving on to guidance. Compuware is reaffirming its projections of $0.50 to $0.54 in GAAP earnings per share for the full year. This reflects the purchase accounting impact of the dynaTrace acquisition, as we detailed on July 6. We continue to expect revenue for the fiscal year at or near $1.06 billion. 
In Q2, we believe earnings per share will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.10, so a good start: two of the fastest-growing SaaS-based businesses in a high-growth categories, and a healthy and mature Mainframe professional service organizations, a strong strategic outlook, greater operational discipline and more transparency forthcoming. We're looking forward to a great year. Laura?"

Q1 definitely represented a solid start to the fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the first quarter came in at $15.2 million. And for the year, we continue to forecast operating cash flow coming in at $160 million to $175 million, which ref",393,"Thanks, Bob. Q1 definitely represented a solid start to the fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the first quarter came in at $15.2 million. And for the year, we continue to forecast operating cash flow coming in at $160 million to $175 million, which reflects the targeted investments in our business units. Q1 operating expenses were $210.4 million, slightly higher than anticipated. The weakening of the U.S. dollar fueled this increase with currency impacting total operating expenses by approximately $7 million. 
Looking forward, in addition to any currency impact, our fiscal year '12 operating expenses will increase for the acquisition of dynaTrace by about $45.5 million. Total operating expenses for the year are now expected to be between $870 million and $885 million. In addition, interest expense related to the purchase of dynaTrace is expected to be approximately $2.2 million for fiscal '12. 
As always, expense management is one of our top priorities and we will continue to work diligently across the organization to identify potential areas of savings and leverage efficiencies while continuing to support our growth vehicles through targeted investments. 
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q1, we did not repurchase any shares, temporarily suspending the program in light of the dynaTrace acquisition. As we mentioned on our dynaTrace acquisition conference call, we've expanded our line of credit to $200 million to complete the $256 million acquisition. Of that $200 million, we expect to borrow less than $150 million at an approximate 2% interest rate. Taking into account the debt and the fact that we are now in our lighter cash flow months of the fiscal year, we have no immediate plans to repurchase stocks. However, by September, we should be in a position to reevaluate the situation. 
Lastly, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 17.6%. The lower rate was primarily due to the impact of the latest Michigan Tax Legislation enacted in the first quarter. In Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%, dropping to 38% in the third and fourth quarters. 
For fiscal '12, the net effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 36%. As you can imagine, this is a very exciting time at Compuware as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and capitalize on our tremendous opportunity. Q1 was a very positive step along the path. Lisa?"

Having said that, we're obviously -- the 2 positive things is that we're feeling very, very comfortable with a strong pipeline for the balance of the year. And the activity and interest around the dynaTrace solution has actually shocked most of us. We thought we were hitting a home run with the Gomez business, and what ended up happening is we're actually getting a lot more activity and interest strategically as it relates to dynaTrace and the on-premise stuff. The other thing I'll say is, as a reminder, is that we actually -- the activity was strong for APM in the Q1 as it relates to new business accounts. So we did have a 16% increase in new logos for the on-premise license, APM business."

So the strategy behind First Mile is that it was so disruptive and new that we knew that there wouldn't be a lot of budgets out there to change the way in which APM is being bought. And so we didn't want to give it to the global sales organization without a tremendous amount of reference ability accomplished and making sure that we had the right pricing strategies, support services and everything else that goes around the solution. So coming out of the gate, we had some key pieces of the web performance solution and some key pieces of the agentless technology built on the appliance. And because of buying behaviors, we found out pretty quickly, this is back in February time frame, tremendous amount of excitement but they want to have everything to drive that composite dashboard, both inside the data center and outside the web. So we've been building furiously the capabilities on top of that platform. We would expect to be in the single digits for millions of dollars this fiscal year. Because again, we've got a limited focus and a single target market that we're allowing. At the point that we get to a 10 or higher. It feels about the right threshold, but we'll see. We then think we'll have enough reference ability to drive that solution into our global sales force. And we'll have the point specific -- I was getting a little bit on the strategy but we'll have the point-specific solutions if I've got the old buying behavior and the specific problem and the global composite solution which would be able to give me full enterprise visibility based upon business relevance, solving and getting into the nth level of detail with the exact problem. And so I would expect the next big move from that appliance is to release it to the general sales organization. I'm not in a position right now to really talk about when that's going to be.

Compuware's new business unit structure gives us much better visibility and control over the business. This drives greater agility, which is especially important in quickly changing market conditions. It also means our management team and our investors can easily evaluate the execution of each part of the business and quickly understand its overall contribution to Compuware's success. To extend this transparency we will now use a consistent format on these calls to discuss quarterly business results. 
First, we'll offer our perspective on the total numbers for the quarter. Next, we'll discuss the performance of this business unit, including revenues, margin, key achievements and important trends. Following the business unit discussion, we'll cover onetime issues and we'll close with guidance. This format, consistent with Compuware's new organizational structure, will provide the most information for our investors in the clearest way possible, and we welcome your feedback. Furthermore, for each of our business units, we are completing detailed 3-year financial on solution-based business plans. This process is a next natural step of the transformation we embarked upon 3 years ago. 
Joe Angileri, who recently joined us as President and COO and brings decades of financial and business consulting experience, will help drive this effort. Joe is working with me and our leadership team to complete it by our October board meeting. We look forward to sharing these plans with you on a detailed Investor Day in New York on November 10th. I believe the 3-year plans will provide you with the insight to clearly evaluate our performance, which includes delivering long-term and consistent increases in revenues and margins. We will update these plans as a continuous process and will use them as a backbone from which to measure the impact of any onetime events or changing market conditions. I look forward to Joe contributing in future earnings calls on this project, and it'll be exciting to have him accelerate our journey towards operational excellence. 
For it's first quarter ended June 30th, Compuware posted positive results with total revenues up 11.4% from Q1 last year to $230 million. Net income was $17 million, up 34.3% from Q1 last year. Earnings per share were $0.08, up from $0.06 per share in Q1 last year. 
As you will hear on our business unit details, strong contributors to our success in Q1 were Mainframe and license, Gomez SaaS platform, Professional Services, Covisint and Maintenance. Geographically, we saw particularly strong results for APM in Europe and for Mainframe in North America. 
Beginning with the Mainframe business unit, Q1 revenues were $97.5 million with a 75% contribution margin in Q1. The profitability of this business unit continues to provide the fuel for Compuware to invest in its growth engines. 
As you remember, 2 significant Mainframe deals slipped out Q4 last year, the smaller of these deals, the financial services agreement, closed in Q1. As expected, the large government agency deal is on track to close in Q2. We see little change in the competitive environment for Mainframe Solutions. With the restructuring of our Mainframe sales team, we're actually starting to see net new business pipeline growth. That's a winning combination for our customers, our investors and for Compuware. 
As mentioned previously, 6 of our top 15 accounts are up for renewal this year. We achieved 92% renewal rates in Q1, which were the same as last year's Q1. Last fiscal year, the overall renewal rates were 93%, but we don't expect any changes to that rate this year. 
The value we're offering with skilled people and scalable programs is ensuring consistency in renewal rates and in our pricing. The APM business unit delivered $55.5 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 25% in Q1. This represents an 18.5% growth in revenue over last year. Contribution margin was impacted by an acceleration of technology investments. 
The Compuware Gomez SaaS solution had a particularly strong quarter with subscription revenues leaping 40.6% from Q1 last year to $18.7 million. The APM on-premise solution did decline in revenue, but for the on-premise solution, we saw a 16% jump in new logos over the prior year. 
As a growth business, our strategic plan for the APM business unit is to invest now to quickly achieve market dominance in the growing $6 billion segment of the category. Our action plan for achieving this position is simple. First, we'll continue to offer best-in-class products to solve painful and expensive point problems related to the poor performance of key web, non-web mobile and cloud applications. 
Today's buying behavior is to buy point solutions and we are winning with our best of breed offerings in business transaction monitoring, agentless and web performance solutions. But the way companies buy today won't solve the problem tomorrow. CIOs and a lot of business leaders are fighting data smog, too much data and too few answers for failing applications in a world of growing IT complexity. 
These organizations are increasingly ready to embrace a single platform that cuts through the complexity and exactly identifies the problem and provides the answers they need. To bring this solution to market worldwide, we are making targeted investments in our APM business unit. Specifically, we continue to invest in our global portal, with specific focus on ease of use, time to value and data analytics in mobile application performance capabilities and in video streaming performance. These investments match some of the hottest technology trends in the market that will position Compuware as the leader in these segments. 
The First Mile solution is a key part of this investment roadmap, as it is the first production instance of a cloud, web and data center metrics in a consolidated dashboard. In a limited release to major retailers, we are in 73 active evaluations today. Success rates will only improve as more capability is added to the supplies. 
Finally, our dynaTrace acquisition represents a critical investment in extending our APM leadership. dynaTrace is recognized as the best in class in the segments of the APM market, especially in Java and dot-net environments. The ability to continuously track business transactions through dynaTrace's patented PurePath technology and provide exact identification of performance problems is game-changing this segment but will also add a powerful level of visibility to the global SaaS-based portal. 
On July 19th, less than 3 weeks after the acquisition, we introduced the initial integration of Compuware Gomez and dynaTrace. We have also already developed a share roadmap for future interoperability. 
Training our field-facing teams has begun, and most sales and presales -- most training for sales and presales will have completed their Phase 1 certification by mid-August. 
This will allow our global APM sales team to sell our entire APM portfolio, including dynaTrace, while the dynaTrace team remains focused on this fiscal year selling its own offering. In both our due diligence and research since, we found we have similar buyer types who are often at different parts of the same organization, reporting them to a shared economic sponsor. This is great news. We've increased our points of entry and our addressable market but with buyers we know and whose problems we understand. dynaTrace is already running ahead of its annual goal, and the annualized run rate for the end of our fiscal year should be approximately $38 million. The existing Compuware sales force should be able to add another $15 million for the remaining 9 months or $20 million annualized, bringing the run rate up to $58 million. 
Even conservatively, if we plan on the growth rate of 70%, which is down from the existing 125% growth rate, we get to just under $100 million in fiscal year '13. We have this plan mapped out by sales organization, geography and channels group. We would need to do about 300 total deals across inside sales, direct and channel organization to achieve this number, which is quite feasible. 
The partners organization continues to contribute significantly to the company's success, particularly that of the APM business unit. We are quickly broadening and deepening our relationships with strategic partners with the goal of delivering $50 million in incremental partner-driven [ph] revenue this fiscal year and another $50 million in partner-influenced deals. 
Here are just a few examples. In Q1, we launched new go-to-market plans with the Cisco field organization and partners, particularly around our combined solution for APM and the Cisco-unified computing system. Cisco teams have been trained on the solution and specific high-value accounts have been targeted. Key systems (sic) [Keynote Systems] signed a massive statement of work framework for all Compuware products in Q1. We received the first 2 orders based on this agreement within a week of signing. 
We're also building on a partnership with British Telecom, which, in Q1, agreed to train 100 of its solution consultants around the world on the Compuware APM solution. Other partnerships that deliver increased performance this quarter include SaaS, Atos Origin, CSC, Logica, Accenture, and others. 
The Compuware Professional Services business unit had a very strong Q1. Taking advantage of increasing demand for mobile application development and other leading technologies, the business unit produced revenue of $39.9 million at a contribution margin of 20.8%. I believe that we can continue to grow on this trajectory through expanding competencies in cloud and mobile application development work. 
The Covisint business unit also had an outstanding quarter with 43.8% increase in revenues year-over-year. Covisint delivered $16.2 million of revenue at a contribution margin of negative 4.1% in Q1. Covisint's margin will breakthrough into a continuous positive ground next quarter. Covisint's market velocity is incredible. More than 11 million unique users logged on to the Covisint network this quarter, a 300% increase from this previous quarter. 
Healthcare revenue grew nearly 52% of the non-healthcare business increased revenues 39.2% year-over-year as a number of large accounts came online. 
The auto segment has also been rejuvenated. The evolution of the connected vehicle, the different ways in which consumers now interact with their vehicles, generates great demand for the security and anytime, anywhere access that only Covisint delivers. 
In the healthcare vertical, we signed 5 new deals with hospital-based accountable care organizations in Q1. New Medicaid reimbursement models requires strong outcomes-based reporting, along with a secured sharing of information. Our combination of a highly secured cloud-based platform and tools for population analysis across the community uniquely position us in this market. 
Covisint's partnership with AT&T and AMA are also delivering results. We signed 2 large care coordination agreements with AT&T in the quarter, including one at Baylor Health Systems in Texas, one of the largest healthy systems in the country. The AMA this quarter, through its Amagine subsidiary, is rolling out Covisint across the country, starting with the next platform being implemented through the Connecticut Medical Society. 
We received many questions regarding a potential IPO and expected valuation numbers. Our guidance has been that Covisint should achieve $80 million in revenue this year. With the visibility we now have in the subscription model and the continued momentum, we now believe we should surpass this guidance. 
If we were to file an S-1 this fall, and complete the IPO next spring, the valuation used for Covisint would be based on calendar year '13 numbers. According to potential book writers of the current growth rate, this would put the valuation at around $1 billion. 
The Covisint competitive environment is largely unchanged. We compete primarily with large integrators like Cap Gemini, IBM Global Services. We win because our SaaS platform offers less risk and faster return. 
The Uniface business unit produced $10.9 million in revenue in Q1 with a contribution margin of 50.6%. Uniface remains strong and positioned to take advantage of macrotrends in application development that demand speed and flexibility. We are seeing growth and opportunities in developing multitenant cloud-based apps. 
The Changepoint business unit achieved $10 million in revenue at a contribution margin of negative 14% in Q1. Our strong focus on professional services automation continues to show promise for more sustained success in the coming quarters. 
Moving on to guidance. Compuware is reaffirming its projections of $0.50 to $0.54 in GAAP earnings per share for the full year. This reflects the purchase accounting impact of the dynaTrace acquisition, as we detailed on July 6. We continue to expect revenue for the fiscal year at or near $1.06 billion. 
In Q2, we believe earnings per share will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.10, so a good start: two of the fastest-growing SaaS-based businesses in a high-growth categories, and a healthy and mature Mainframe professional service organizations, a strong strategic outlook, greater operational discipline and more transparency forthcoming. We're looking forward to a great year. Laura?"

Operating cash flow for the first quarter came in at $15.2 million. And for the year, we continue to forecast operating cash flow coming in at $160 million to $175 million, which reflects the targeted investments in our business units. Q1 operating expenses were $210.4 million, slightly higher than anticipated. The weakening of the U.S. dollar fueled this increase with currency impacting total operating expenses by approximately $7 million. 
Looking forward, in addition to any currency impact, our fiscal year '12 operating expenses will increase for the acquisition of dynaTrace by about $45.5 million. Total operating expenses for the year are now expected to be between $870 million and $885 million. In addition, interest expense related to the purchase of dynaTrace is expected to be approximately $2.2 million for fiscal '12. 
As always, expense management is one of our top priorities and we will continue to work diligently across the organization to identify potential areas of savings and leverage efficiencies while continuing to support our growth vehicles through targeted investments. 
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q1, we did not repurchase any shares, temporarily suspending the program in light of the dynaTrace acquisition. As we mentioned on our dynaTrace acquisition conference call, we've expanded our line of credit to $200 million to complete the $256 million acquisition. Of that $200 million, we expect to borrow less than $150 million at an approximate 2% interest rate. Taking into account the debt and the fact that we are now in our lighter cash flow months of the fiscal year, we have no immediate plans to repurchase stocks. However, by September, we should be in a position to reevaluate the situation. 
Lastly, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 17.6%. The lower rate was primarily due to the impact of the latest Michigan Tax Legislation enacted in the first quarter. In Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%, dropping to 38% in the third and fourth quarters. 
For fiscal '12, the net effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 36%. As you can imagine, this is a very exciting time at Compuware as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and capitalize on our tremendous opportunity. Q1 was a very positive step along the path. Lisa?"

And the activity and interest around the dynaTrace solution has actually shocked most of us. We thought we were hitting a home run with the Gomez business, and what ended up happening is we're actually getting a lot more activity and interest strategically as it relates to dynaTrace and the on-premise stuff. The other thing I'll say is, as a reminder, is that we actually -- the activity was strong for APM in the Q1 as it relates to new business accounts.

We then think we'll have enough reference ability to drive that solution into our global sales force. And we'll have the point specific -- I was getting a little bit on the strategy but we'll have the point-specific solutions if I've got the old buying behavior and the specific problem and the global composite solution which would be able to give me full enterprise visibility based upon business relevance, solving and getting into the nth level of detail with the exact problem. And so I would expect the next big move from that appliance is to release it to the general sales organization. I'm not in a position right now to really talk about when that's going to be. But obviously, we'd be disappointed if we didn't have it ready for next fiscal year."

Compuware post a solid Q2 featuring year-over-year revenue growth of 15% to $261 million, which is a strong but given all top line revenue categories. Software license fees increased more than 35%  year-over-year to $62 million, maintenance of Cistercian streams grew 5% year-over-year to $128 million driven by our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional customer value at every level of business. Professional services revenue increased nearly 16% year-over-year to $53 million as our offerings in high demand areas like mobility, virtualization and cloud-based technologies drive new business. At $0.10 per share, we're pleased with this level of earnings and we have the opportunity to do much better.
To more effective leverage our positive operating results, we are applying a laser focus improving margins, a topic on which Joe will provide more color later in the call. Our recently completed three-year planning process gives me great optimism that we can substantially improve company margins by fiscal year '14. We'll provide additional details around our margin and revenue plans for the next 3 years, our financial analyst and investor day on December 8 in New York City.
As with the last quarter, I'll share detail with you on the performance of these business units.
The mainframe business unit produced future revenues of $119 million and 8% contribution margin, revenues were up 16 % year-over-year. Looking forward 2 of our top 15 mainframe renewals have closed with 4 more expected this quarter. Given these business and market conditions, we're revising our guidance for this fiscal year to show a slight growth in total mainframe revenue. We also believe that soon will dynaTrace's unique pure path capability extending into the mainframe, we have the potential to help the world's largest mainframe organization understand the specific load impact of web, mobile and cloud-based applications on their mainframe systems. The dynaTrace team is collaborating with the original core Avon [ph] team to bringing this solution to the market. We hope to have the solution in the field by the end of the calendar year. The Compuware APM business unit including dynaTrace produced $63 million of revenue in Q2 with a margin comparable to Q1 of minus 27%. Total revenues including Compuware grew 11% year-over-year. As we have now integrated and sell the dynaTrace and on premise solutions together, we've combined them in our financial statements. With dynaTrace, on premise license revenues were essentially flat compared to a strong Q2 last year of $18 million. Subscription revenues increased about 5% year-over-year from Q2 last year to $19 million. With consistent win rates and a clear lead over the competition, our APM business has seen a remarkable uptick in overall pipeline, particularly related to dynaTrace. The overall dynaTrace pipeline forecast at the close of fiscal year has grown 128% since the acquisition date. In the last few weeks, our Compuware sales team has added 103 new dynaTrace opportunity supply plan.
We're still evaluating when this activity will result in close agreements, but we are working hard to optimize our results. We provide a complete dynaTrace training to the entire APM sales team and we will continue to monitor pipeline growth weekly. For the fiscal year, including dynaTrace, we expect to deliver a nearly 35% increase in combined APM new license. Our key investments are marginalizing the competition and extending our lead in growing segments. By building out our APM global platform, integration with dynaTrace, web load testing, mobile and streaming capabilities, we have leapfrog the competition.
Our mobile capabilities in particular are leading industry. Because of industry first like mobile customer conversion analytics, integration with Google mobile page speed and the world's largest global performance network, customers are choosing Compuware for the most important mobile performance initiatives.
As discussed in prior quarters, these accelerated investments will moderate our margins in the short-term, which will position us very well for fiscal year '13. Sales and technical integration with dynaTrace continues to proceed successfully. Sales collaboration, that's already created opportunities on new accounts and cross-selling opportunities with existing customers. We're also introducing dynaTrace to the partner channel. Technical integration is proceeding quickly as Compuware launch Gomez 360 Web Load Testing in September. This solution combines Gomez and dynaTrace to radically improve time-to-market for web-based apps.
The dynaTrace 4.0 release and Gomez release has include additional integration that allows customers to trace individual transactions from user devices through the cloud and data center all the way to the specific lines of code in the application. dynaTrace's unique capabilities has also strengthened our on premise offering for the cold level of detail application teams need. With dynaTrace, we are winning projects we would have lost before and competing in projects where we would have been left out. We're very optimistic about our momentum and strategy in this space, recently validated by our leadership position in Gartner's magic quadrant for the APM market. We're offering our customers best-in-class solutions in key point areas across in today. We also have complete solution that allows senior management to cope with new cloud-based universe that they have to face tomorrow. Our partner organization remains a critical component of our growth strategy. Foremost, our partner has provided us with additional skill and capacity to meet market demands. Additionally, our partners create opportunities for market innovation, expanding our ability to deliver disruptive solutions. Finally, our partners, particularly managed service providers and cloud service providers are increasingly becoming direct customers as they make buying decisions for the thousands of customers they represent.
During Q2, service providers were active with our APM offerings as Cable and Wireless alone closed 11 transactions nearly 1 quarter of the world's top consumers of service providers are now running on Compuware APM solutions.
We've achieved this success, which touches some of the world's largest company in a single year.
We have 22 more deals in progress in managed service providers. We're finalizing 8 new go to market offerings with partners like [ph] cable and Wireless, Computer Sciences Corporation, Cisco and Accenture with an emphasis on our on premise solutions. Cisco continues to be a star in the party universe with significant closed business this year. The pipeline for Q3 looks even stronger. More than 400 Cisco sales professionals are now trained on Compuware APM Solutions, 4 Cisco Unified Computing System partners are now signed on to Compuware Partners [ph] with 2 contracts pending at 19 more in qualification.
Compuware's Professional Services business unit had another strong quarter. The revenues up 15% from Q2 last year to $240 million. We have significantly increased our Services segment contribution margin from last year, 20% from 16%. Our specialized competencies in mobile application development, global application sourcing, telematics and cloud implementation and management will continue to drive profitable revenue in the quarters ahead. Covisint have now stand in Q2 with $18 million in revenue, 44% increase over the prior year. Contribution margin was minus 13% as we continue to invest in the business. Covisint's unique value proposition spans industries that need to connect online with customers, suppliers and partners.
By simply and securely managing these engagements in the cloud, Covisint has become the platform of choice for the healthcare and automotive industries with emerging success in the few other industry segments. In the healthcare area, we are experiencing a transition away from state-based health information exchanges as Medicare reimbursed models are shifting to give advantages to care coordination networks and accountable care organizations.
This direct-to-the-market philosophy in healthcare to points of entry where we have strong competitive advantages. In Q2, we launched the first operational Beacon community health information exchange in the country. That is key links 1,600 providers and patients to monitor and improve care. We also signed a strategic partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield Association to deliver a new marketplace of healthcare services nationally for the 39 Blue's plans. Additionally, we launched one of the largest private health information exchanges in the country at Baylor Health Systems. Our non-healthcare business remained strong as we signed a major portal deal with one of the largest global automotive companies in Q2. This portal will provide an engagement platform for the automotive companies business worldwide.
We continue to expand on oil and gas industry as well. In Q2, we extended agreement with the second largest global oil company that services sole provider of all external identity management services. We are taking all the necessary steps to conduct our IPO Covisint. As we evaluate timing, if independent confirmations of financial advisers that we could achieve $1 billion valuation in late Q1 or Q2 next year, given our current growth rate.
We look forward to announcing the underwriters in the near future. The Uniphase business unit had another strong quarter delivering $12 million of revenues and 11% increase over Q2 last year and a 57% contribution margins. Uniphase continues to enjoy the highly profitable resurgence based upon rapid development of rich internet and chrome-based apps. The Changepoint business unit produced total revenues of $11 million in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Contribution margin was flat, a major improvement from minus 18% last year in Q2. The business unit continues to benefit from a strong focus in helping technology, professional services companies increase engagement profitability.
In terms of guidance, Compuware is revising its full-year projections for EPS to range of $0.47 to $0.50. The reasons for these are as follows: First, we have a much stronger dollar against the euro, which has a negative impact on our model. Second, with a new subscription-based dynaTrace UEM solution that was just released, we will see a higher percentage of ratable deals, which obviously means  more revenue will go into deferred. Third, although second half APM pipeline is strong, it will not make up for the slower than expected growth at APM in the first half. Our revenue guidance is now $1.04 billion of total revenue for the fiscal year. For Q3, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. We'll provide more detailed guidance in our financial analyst and investor day in December.
Thank you, Joe."

As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at D",1009,"Thanks, Bob. Now that I've been with Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observation. As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at Deloitte. As a partner, I managed a number of aspects of Deloitte's business on a local, regional and national level. I served on Deloitte's board and I managed Deloitte's strategic sales organization. Just prior to my departure, I ran the Michigan practice for Deloitte, which include all businesses from auditing to consulting. I also had been an adviser to Compuware for more than 20 years before joining the company. Just from my observations of the business, let me start by saying that I'm very excited about being part of this organization. We've got a great leadership team, a terrific portfolio of businesses, outstanding solutions and services that are in high demand in the market.
For instance, one of our for growth drivers, Covisint is at the forefront of a potential new category in platform as a service. Multi-enterprise collaboration is a pace setter with its secure authentication capabilities. Clearly, Covisint is a league of its own. With the ever-growing need for secure online collaboration in just about any industry can think of, we truly believe Covisint's potential is boundless.
Of course, APM is our key growth driver and is receiving a great deal of our investment focus. As we see this business is growing substantially, ultimately becoming Compuware's largest. Something that became really apparent to me upon joining Compuware is that we have the solution portfolio and the underlying strategy to absolutely own the APM market.
We are light-years ahead of the competition in terms of our ability to help customers not only solve their business application performance problems but more so to avoid them altogether. And unlike the competition, we can do this regardless of whether the application resides behind a firewall or in the cloud. Furthermore, our position to market is enviable. Not only do we possess the best-in-breed solutions across the entire application delivery chain, as the cloud expands and becomes even more disruptive, organizations will need complete end-to-end solutions to ensure optical performance of their business-critical applications. As you know, that place right into our wheelhouse. Our recent acquisition of dynaTrace further cements our position as the undisputed leader in APM. Through internal innovation as well as through additional acquisition, we fully intend on remaining on top of the hill in the APM market. In terms of our general acquisition strategy, we continue to look for the right opportunities at the right price to build up the core aspects of our application performance management solution. Of course, I also understand that the strength and tremendous cash flow provided by our Mainframe business, fuels our growth objectives. We see the Mainframe continuing to be a very viable business both currently and in the years to come. As I mentioned, as a consultant at Deloitte, I was very involved in the Compuware business. And over that span, I often heard rumors of the imminent demise of the mainframe as a computing platform. But I think it's safe to say that, that's certainly not the case. From our perspective, while our Mainframe results can be rather lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, business itself has proven to be quite resilient and if anything, we see a bright future for the Mainframe.
The rapid expansion of cloud computing and mobile applications, which in turn generate tremendous amounts of data and transactions that need to be processed, Mainframe due to its stability and security will continue to be a core component of companies, particularly large enterprises' computing strategies.
This dynamic bodes well for the Mainframe because of the strength of our industry-leading solutions as well as our unique ability to support enterprise initiatives in the cloud bodes well for Compuware too. Now from an operating standpoint, we're becoming very focused on margins, yet some work yet to do here as we are not quite as lean and crisp in this area as we need to be. However, with the proper focus, we can certainly make great strides in this regard while driving focused investments in those areas that will produce the highest returns.
This kind of focus is critical in achieving our corporate goals and reaching our tremendous potential. That said, there are some areas we will address to enhance our ability to reduce costs. Some of the key areas we'll be looking at will include our customer acquisition process, sales productivity, quality and customer satisfaction, our overall cost of infrastructure moving to a more virtual work environment where possible as an example.
For the coming year, we'll focus on optimizing these areas and we'll fully expect to see solid margin improvements in the future. We'll share more details about this with you on December 8 in New York. So stay tuned, more to come.
Filling my days, I spent the last 3 months coming up to speed in our businesses, spending most of that time in the office with our people, learning as much as I can. However, as an ex-consultant, I'm getting a little antsy and I want to be out engaged with our customers and the analyst community. Therefore, I plan on doing that in the coming months. This will be tremendously valuable and helping me understand how our customers use and value solutions by allowing me to learn firsthand what they find important and what they need to be successful.
Additionally, getting out on the road will allow me to live a bit in the field with our sales team, the face of Compuware to the market. And I'm sure you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about the business and about our prospects. Most of the pieces are already in place. Now it's our job to go out and execute. Personally and professionally, I can't imagine being in a better situation than I look forward to helping lead Compuware to new Heights. Laura?"

We're glad to have you here. Highlighted by strong performances in our Mainframe and Professional Services business units, Q2 was a positive follow-up to a solid Q1. Overall, we are encouraged by our results",334,"Thanks, Joe, and welcome to the Compuware team. We're glad to have you here. Highlighted by strong performances in our Mainframe and Professional Services business units, Q2 was a positive follow-up to a solid Q1. Overall, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of fiscal year '12. Operating cash flow for Q2 was approximately $16.6 million, bringing up to $31.8 million for the first half of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow for the year to come in between $160 million and $175 million. Q2 operating expenses were approximately $222.5 million dollars. Year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to currency and the expenses associated with the purchase and operation of dynaTrace.
We expect total operating expenses for the year to be between $880 million and $890 million. As we've often discussed, expense management is a critical facet of our strategic plan. We continue to stride to keep costs in check while maintaining a level of investment necessary to ensure our growth areas reach their full potential.
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q2, we repurchased approximately 422,000 shares for about $3.3 million. Going forward, we will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
In terms of our current debt position, as of September 30, our long-term debt balance was approximately $126 million. We continue to anticipate repaying the majority of this obligation by the end of the fiscal year.
And finally, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40.6% due to a deferred tax adjustment. In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39%, dropping to 30% in Q4 when we expect to receive final settlement of certain IRS exempt. Overall, our effective tax rate for the year is now expected to be approximately 35
The second quarter was another clear indicator of the incredible progress we have made and are making across the company as we position Compuware for substantial growth in the quarters to come. Lisa?"

There are fundamentally 2 things that's happening at APM. And I talked about in Q1. I thought we were it was just an education issue but when we integrated the sales organizations, we basically put all of the 3 and then some best-in-class solutions into their sales kit bag. And so now, a traditional Gomez rep could sell everything and it led to a certain amount of distraction, obviously, training issues and above and beyond that. Second thing that happened is upon the dynaTrace acquisition, there was some positioning clarification between our existing on premise solutions and the dynaTrace solutions that have to occur number one with our existing sales force and number two, with the marketplace. And so, what it did is it created some extended sales cycle. When we've lost any deals above normal, so the success rates continue. We just had some extensions in the deals that we have. So those 2 factors we now make sure that we got a focus back in the sales organization. We've already made those slight adjustments. So if the Gomez rep was used to selling Gomez. They bag kit selling Gomez fast. Hence, and that continues obviously with dynaTrace team and with the agent-less the on premise team. So with that, we had some kit bags from the sales execution that we had expected. We're already seeing that in the pipeline and commit for the coming quarters and we're working over the last 60 days, we've been working over time and clarifying the position difference between what dynaTrace can do and what the on premise vantage can do. So we're obviously very confident of the second half of the year with all the data that we can see is going to return us back into growth rates and that's why we're very much looking forward to December to sharing some of that with you."

So there are 2 things that happened, it did go over it earlier, Derek. So I'll cover it very, very briefly right here. The 2 things that happened the sales organization is -- we moved everybody together from the Gomez and the on premise group in a single sales structure. That continues to be in place. But what we also did is we put all the APM solutions in their back to sell and that created a distraction from what they were good at and the people who they were talking to and their expertise and positioning in winning against traditional competition.
So we've subsequently fixed the that. The second thing that happened with the acquisition of dynaTrace and although the dynaTrace demand has far exceeded, far exceeded our expectations in the field so we're dealing with that from the sales execution perspective. It also added length to the sales cycle because there was some confusion at the beginning about where dynaTrace fit versus the Gomez on premise solutions fit. We since then a substantial amount of training globally for our sales organization to clarify that. We're doing a lot of outreach programs in the marketplace to clarify that and I think we're in good shape moving forward. That did have an impact in the growth rates in the first half. And given the pipeline and the comments that we're seeing right now, we're in good shape going into the second half."

We've got some very large projects going on there. We talked about the subsegment of the connected vehicle. And interestingly enough, a couple of these initiatives are turning into instead of fewer B to B plays, as companies now look directly to the consumer to sell their goods and services, it's having an impact on what we're seeing in the pipeline.

Compuware posted a solid Q2 featuring year-over-year revenue growth of more than 15% to $261 million, reaching strong momentum in all top line revenue categories. Software license fees increased more than 35%  year-over-year to $62 million, maintenance and subscription fees grew 5% year-over-year to $128 million, driven by our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional customer value at every level of business.
Professional services revenue increased nearly 16% year-over-year to $53 million as our offerings in high demand areas like mobility, virtualization and cloud-based technologies drive new business. At $0.10 per share, we're pleased with this level of earnings and we have the opportunity to do much better.
To more effective leverage our positive operating results, we're applying a laser focus to improving margins, a topic on which Joe will provide more color later in the call. Our recently completed 3-year planning process gives me great optimism that we can substantially improve company margins by fiscal year '14. We'll provide additional details around our margin and revenue plans for next 3 years at our financial analyst and investor day on December 8 in New York City.
As with the last quarter, I will share details with you on the performance of these business units. The mainframe business unit produced future revenues of $119 million and 80% contribution margin, revenues were up 16% year-over-year. Looking forward, 2 of our top 15 mainframe renewals have closed with 4 more expected this quarter. Given these business and market conditions, we're revising our guidance for this fiscal year to show a slight growth in total mainframe revenue. We also believe that soon with dynaTrace's unique pure path capability extending into the mainframe, we have the potential to help the world's largest mainframe organizations understand the specific load impact of Web, mobile and cloud-based applications on their mainframe systems. The dynaTrace team is collaborating with the original core Abend-AID team on doing -- bringing this solution to market. We hope to have the solution in the field by the end of the calendar year.
The Compuware APM business unit including dynaTrace produced $63 million of revenue in Q2, with a margin comparable to Q1 at minus 27%. Total revenues, including dynaTrace, grew 11% year-over-year. As we have now integrated and sell the dynaTrace and on-premise solutions together, we have combined them in our financial statements. With dynaTrace on-premise license revenues were essentially flat compared to a strong Q2 last year at $18 million. Subscription revenues increased about 5% year-over-year from Q2 last year to $19 million. With consistent win rates and a clear lead over the competition, our APM business has seen a remarkable uptick in overall pipeline, particularly related to dynaTrace. The overall dynaTrace pipeline forecast at the close of fiscal year has grown 128% since the acquisition date. In the last few weeks, the Compuware sales team has added 103 new dynaTrace opportunities to the pipeline.
We're still evaluating when this activity will result in close agreements, but we are working hard to optimize our results. We provide a complete dynaTrace training to the entire APM sales team, and we will continue to monitor pipeline growth weekly. For the fiscal year, including dynaTrace, we expect to deliver a nearly 35% increase in combined APM new license.
Our key investments are marginalizing the competition and extending our lead in growing segments. By building out our APM global platform, integration with dynaTrace, Web load testing, mobile and streaming capabilities, we have leapfrogged the competition.
Our mobile capabilities, in particular, are leading industry. Because of industry first like mobile customer conversion analytics, integration with Google Mobile Page Speed and the world's largest global performance network, customers are choosing Compuware for the most important mobile performance initiatives. As discussed in prior quarters, these accelerated investments will moderate our margins in the short-term, but will position us very well for fiscal year '13.
Sales and technical integration with dynaTrace continues to proceed successfully. Sales collaboration, that's already created opportunities in new accounts and cross-selling opportunities with existing customers. We're also introducing dynaTrace to the partner channel. Technical integration is proceeding quickly as Compuware launch Gomez 360° Web Load Testing in September. This solution combines Gomez and dynaTrace's radically improve time-to-market for web-based apps.
The dynaTrace 4.0 release and Gomez release has include additional integration that allows customers to trace individual transactions from the user devices through the cloud and data center all the way to the specific lines of code in the application. dynaTrace's unique capabilities also strengthened our on-premise offering for the code-level of detail application teams need.
With dynaTrace, we are winning projects we would have lost before and competing in projects where we would have been left out. We're very optimistic about our momentum and strategy in this space, recently validated by our leadership position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for the APM market. We're offering our customers best-in-class solutions in key point areas that cause them pain today. We also have complete solution that allows senior management to cope with new cloud-based universe that they have to face tomorrow.
Our partner organization remains a critical component of our growth strategy. Foremost, our partner has provided us with additional skill and capacity to meet market demands. Additionally, our partners create opportunities for market innovation, expanding our ability to deliver disruptive solutions. Finally, our partners, particularly managed service providers and cloud service providers, are increasingly becoming direct customers as they make buying decisions for the thousands of customers they represent.
During Q2, service providers were active with our APM offerings as Cable and Wireless alone closed 11 transactions, nearly 1/4 of the world's top consumers of service providers are now running on Compuware APM solutions. We've achieved this success, which touches some of the world's largest companies in a single year.
We have 22 more deals in progress in managed service providers. We are finalizing 8 new go-to market offerings with partners like Sam's [ph], Cable&Wireless, Computer Sciences Corporation, Cisco and Accenture with an emphasis on our on-premise solutions. Cisco continues to be a star in the part of the universe with significant closed business this year, and the pipeline for Q3 looks even stronger. More than 400 Cisco sales professionals are now trained on Compuware APM Solutions; 4 Cisco Unified Computing System partners are now signed on with Compuware Partners, with 2 contracts pending and 19 more in qualification.
Compuware's professional services business unit had another strong quarter, with the revenues up 15% from Q2 last year to $40 million. We have significantly increased our services segment contribution margin from last year to 20% from 16%. Our specialized competencies in mobile application development, global application sourcing, telematics and cloud implementation and management will continue to drive profitable revenue in the quarters ahead.
Covisint had an outstanding Q2 with $18 million in revenue, a 44% increase over the prior year. Contribution margin was minus 13% as we continue to invest in the business. Covisint's unique value proposition spans industries that need to connect online with customers, suppliers and partners. By simply and securely managing these engagements in the cloud, Covisint has become the platform of choice for the healthcare and automotive industries with emerging success in a few other industry segments.
In the healthcare arena, we are experiencing a transition away from state-based health information exchanges as Medicare reimbursement models are shifting to give advantages to care coordination networks and accountable care organizations. This direct-to-the-market philosophy in healthcare to points of entry where we have strong competitive advantages. In Q2, we launched the first operational Beacon Community health information exchange in the country. This HIIS links 1,600 providers and patients to monitor and improve care. We also signed a strategic partnership with BlueCross BlueShield Association to deliver a new marketplace in healthcare services nationally for the 39 Blue's plans. Additionally, we launched one of the largest private health information exchanges in the country at Baylor Health Systems.
Our non-healthcare business remain strong as we signed a major portal deal with one of the largest global automotive companies in Q2. This portal will provide an engagement platform for the automotive companies business worldwide.
We continue to expand in the oil and gas industry as well. In Q2, we extended an agreement with the second largest global oil company that services sole provider of all external identity management services. We are taking all of the necessary steps to conduct and carve an IPO at Covisint. As we evaluate timing, we have independent confirmations of financial advisers that we could achieve $1 billion valuation in late Q1 or Q2 next year, given our current growth rate. We look forward to announcing the underwriters in the near future.
The Uniface business unit had another strong quarter delivering $12 million in revenue and 11% increase over Q2 last year, at a 57% contribution margins. Uniface continues to enjoy the highly profitable resurgence based upon rapid development of rich internet and cloud-based apps.
The Changepoint business unit produced total revenues of $11 million in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Contribution margin was flat, a major improvement from minus 18% last year in Q2. The business unit continues to benefit from a strong focus on helping technology, professional services companies increase engagement profitability.
In terms of guidance, Compuware is revising its full-year projections for EPS to a range of $0.47 to $0.50. The reasons for these are as follows. First, we have a much stronger dollar against the euro, which has a negative impact on our model. Second, with a new subscription-based dynaTrace UEM solution that was just released, we will see a higher percentage of ratable deals, which obviously means  more revenue will go into deferred. Third, although second half APM pipeline is strong, it will not make up for the slower-than-expected growth of APM in the first half.
Our revenue guidance is now $1.04 billion in total revenue for the fiscal year. For Q3, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. We will provide more detailed guidance in our financial analyst and investor day in December. Thank you. Joe?"

Now that I've been at Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today, I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observation.
As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at Deloitte. As a partner, I managed a number of aspects of Deloitte's business on a local, regional and national level. I served on Deloitte's board and I managed Deloitte's strategic sales organization. And just prior to my departure, I ran the Michigan practice for Deloitte, which include all businesses from auditing to consulting.
I also had been an adviser to Compuware for more than 20 years before joining the company. As for my observations of the business, let me start by saying that I'm very excited about being part of this organization. We've got a great leadership team, a terrific portfolio of businesses and outstanding solutions and services that are in high demand in the market.
For instance, one of our core growth drivers, Covisint, is at the forefront of a potential new category in Platform-as-a-Service, multi-enterprise collaboration, and is a pace setter with its secure authentication capabilities. Clearly, Covisint is in a league of its own. And with the ever-growing need for secure online collaboration in just about every industry you can think of, we truly believe Covisint's potential is boundless.
Of course, APM is our key growth driver and is receiving a great deal of our investment focus. As we see this business is growing substantially and ultimately becoming Compuware's largest. One thing that became readily apparent to me upon joining Compuware is that we have the solution portfolio and the underlying strategy to absolutely own the APM market.
We are light-years ahead of the competition in terms of our ability to help customers not only to solve their business application performance problems, but more so to avoid them altogether. And unlike the competition, we can do this regardless of whether the application resides behind a firewall or in the cloud.
Furthermore, our position in market is enviable. Not only do we possess the best-in-breed solutions across the entire application delivery chain, but as the cloud expands and becomes even more disruptive, organizations will need complete end-to-end solutions to ensure optimal performance of their business-critical applications. And as you know, that place right into our wheelhouse.
Our recent acquisition of dynaTrace further cements our position as the undisputed leader in APM. And through internal innovation as well as through additional acquisition, we fully intend on remaining on top of the hill in the APM market. In terms of our general acquisition strategy, we'll continue to look for the right opportunities at the right price to build up the core aspects of our application performance management solutions.
Of course, I also understand that the strength and tremendous cash flow provided by our mainframe business fuels our growth objectives. We see the mainframe continuing to be a very viable business both currently and in the years to come. As I mentioned, as a consultant at Deloitte, I was very involved in the Compuware business. And over that span, I often heard rumors of the imminent demise of the mainframe as a computing platform. But I think it's safe to say that, that's certainly not the case.
From our perspective, while our mainframe results can be rather lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, the business itself has proven to be quite resilient and if anything, we see a bright future for the mainframe. With the rapid expansion of cloud computing and mobile applications, which in turn generate tremendous amounts of data and transactions that need to be processed, the mainframe, due to its stability and security, will continue to be a core component of companies, particularly large enterprises' computing strategies. This dynamic bodes well for the mainframe, and because of the strength of our industry-leading solutions as well as our unique ability to support enterprise initiatives in the cloud bodes well for Compuware too.
Now from an operating standpoint, we're becoming very focused on margins, we have some work yet to do here, as we are not quite as lean and crisp in this area as we need to be. However, with the proper focus, we can certainly make great strides in this regard while driving focused investments in those areas that will produce the highest returns. This kind of focus is critical in achieving our corporate goals and reaching our tremendous potential.
That said, there are some areas we will address to enhance our ability to reduce costs. Some of the key areas we'll be looking at will include our customer acquisition process, our sales productivity, quality and customer satisfaction and our overall cost of infrastructure, moving to a more virtual work environment, where possible, as an example.
Over the coming year, we'll focus on optimizing these areas and we'll fully expect to see solid margin improvements in the future. We'll share more details about this with you on December 8 in New York. So stay tuned, more to come.
As for hard and filling my days, I've spent the last 3 months coming up to speed in our businesses, spending most of that time in the office with our people, learning as much as I can. However, as an ex-consultant, I'm getting a little antsy, and I want to be out, engaged with our customers and with the analyst community. Therefore, I plan on doing that in the coming months. This will be tremendously valuable in helping me understand how our customers use and value solutions while allowing me to learn firsthand what they find important and what they need to be successful.
Additionally, getting out on the road will allow me to live a bit in the field with our sales team, the face of Compuware to the market. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about the business and about our prospects. Most of the pieces are already in place. Now it's our job to go out and execute. Personally and professionally, I can't imagine being in a better situation than I look forward to helping lead Compuware to new heights. Laura?"

Overall, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of fiscal year '12. Operating cash flow for Q2 was approximately $16.6 million, bringing out to $31.8 million for the first half of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow for the year to come in between $160 million and $175 million.
Q2 operating expenses were approximately $222.5 million dollars. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to currency and the expenses associated with the purchase and operation of dynaTrace. We expect total operating expenses for the year to be between $880 million and $890 million. As we've often discussed, expense management is a critical facet of our strategic plan. We continue to strive to keep costs in check while maintaining a level of investment necessary to ensure our growth areas reach their full potential.
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q2, we repurchased approximately 422,000 shares for about $3.3 million. Going forward, we will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
In terms of our current debt position, as of September 30, our long-term debt balance was approximately $126 million. We continue to anticipate repaying the majority of this obligation by the end of the fiscal year.
And finally, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40.6% due to a deferred tax adjustment. In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39%, dropping to 30% in Q4 when we expect to receive final settlement of certain IRS exempt. Overall, our effective tax rate for the year is now expected to be approximately 35%.
The second quarter was another clear indicator of the incredible progress we have made and are making across the company as we position Compuware for substantial growth in the quarters to come. Lisa?"

Now -- it's a great question. There are fundamentally 2 things that are happening in APM. And I talked about it in Q1 and thought we were -- it was just an education issue, but when we integrated the sales organizations, we basically put all of the 3, and then some, best-in-class solutions into their sales kit bag. And so now, a traditional Gomez rep could sell everything and it led to a certain amount of distraction, obviously, training issues and above and beyond that. The second thing that happened is upon the dynaTrace acquisition, there were some positioning clarification between our existing on-premise solutions and the dynaTrace solutions that had to occur, number one, with our existing sales force and number two, with the marketplace. And so, what it did is it created some extended sales cycles. Our -- when we've lost any deals above normal, so the success rates continue, we just had some extensions in the deals that we had So with those 2 factors, we've now made sure that we've got a focus back in the sales organization. We've already made those slight adjustments. So if the Gomez rep was used to selling Gomez, they're back at selling Gomez, SaaS. Hence, and that continues, obviously, with the dynaTrace team and with the agent list, the on-premise team. So with that, we get back to the sales execution that we had expected. We're already seeing that in the pipeline and then commit for the coming quarters and we're working, over the last 60 days, we've been working over time and clarifying the position difference between what dynaTrace can do and what the on premise Vantage can do. So we're obviously very confident that the second half of the year with all the data that we can see is going to return us back into growth rates and that's why we're very much looking forward to December to sharing some of that with you."

The 2 things that happened in the sales organization is we moved everybody together from the Gomez and the on-premise group in a single sales structure. That continues to be in place.

So we've subsequently fixed the that. The second thing that happened with the acquisition of dynaTrace, and although the dynaTrace demand has far exceeded, far exceeded our expectations in the field so we're dealing with that from the sales execution perspective. But it also added lengths to the sales cycle because there was some confusion at the beginning about where dynaTrace in that fit versus the Gomez on-premise solution fit.

Consumerization of IT and consumption economics, it's all adoption. And so as we get more wins and use cases, that revenue and uptake will continue to happen. We're getting quite a bit of interest from financial services and travel services organizations, especially those with franchisee models and sort of local retail services of their company and trying to collaborate across that franchise model. We've got some very large projects going on there. We talked about the subsegment of the connected vehicle. And interestingly enough, a couple of these initiatives are turning into, instead of pure B-to-B plays there -- as companies now look directly to the consumer to sell their goods and services, it's having an impact on what we're seeing in the pipeline. Meaning, we typically get employees of various companies or physicians, various healthcare systems adopting the Covisint platform.

Compuware posted a solid Q2 featuring year-over-year revenue growth of more than 15% to $261 million, reaching strong momentum in all top line revenue categories. Software license fees increased more than 35%  year-over-year to $62 million, maintenance and subscription fees grew 5% year-over-year to $128 million, driven by our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional customer value at every level of the business.
Professional services revenue increased nearly 16% year-over-year to $53 million as our offerings in high demand areas like mobility, virtualization and cloud-based technologies drive new business. At $0.10 per share, we're pleased with this level of earnings, but we have the opportunity to do much better.
To more effectively leverage our positive operating results, we're applying a laser focus to improving margins, a topic on which Joe will provide more color later in the call. Our recently completed 3-year planning process gives me great optimism that we can substantially improve company margins by fiscal year '14. We'll provide additional details around our margin and revenue plans for next 3 years at our financial analyst and investor day on December 8 in New York City.
As with the last quarter, I will share details with you on the performance of these business units. The mainframe business unit produced Q2 revenues of $118 million and 80% contribution margin, revenues were up 16% year-over-year. Looking forward, 2 of our top 15 mainframe renewals have closed with 4 more expected this quarter. Given these business and market conditions, we're revising our guidance for this fiscal year to show a slight growth in total mainframe revenue. We also believe that soon with dynaTrace's unique pure path capability extending into the mainframe, we have the potential to help the world's largest mainframe organizations understand the specific load impact of Web, mobile and cloud-based applications on their mainframe systems. The dynaTrace team is collaborating with the original core Abend-AID team on doing -- bringing this solution to market. We hope to have the solution in the field by the end of the calendar year.
The Compuware APM business unit including dynaTrace produced $63 million of revenue in Q2, with a margin comparable to Q1 at minus 27%. Total revenues, including dynaTrace, grew 11% year-over-year. As we have now integrated and sell the dynaTrace and on-premise solutions together, we have combined them in our financial statements. With dynaTrace on-premise license revenues were essentially flat compared to a strong Q2 last year at $18 million. Subscription revenues increased about 5% year-over-year from Q2 last year to $19 million. With consistent win rates and a clear lead over the competition, our APM business has seen a remarkable uptick in overall pipeline, particularly related to dynaTrace. The overall dynaTrace pipeline forecast at the close of fiscal year has grown 128% since the acquisition date. In the last few weeks, the Compuware sales team has added 103 new dynaTrace opportunities to the pipeline.
We're still evaluating when this activity will result in closed agreements, but we are working hard to optimize our results. We provide a complete dynaTrace training to the entire APM sales team, and we will continue to monitor pipeline growth weekly. For the fiscal year, including dynaTrace, we expect to deliver a nearly 35% increase in combined APM new license.
Our key investments are marginalizing the competition and extending our lead in growing segments. By building out our APM global platform, integration with dynaTrace, Web load testing, mobile and streaming capabilities, we have leapfrogged the competition.
Our mobile capabilities, in particular, are leading industry. Because of industry first like mobile customer conversion analytics, integration with Google Mobile Page Speed and the world's largest global performance network, customers are choosing Compuware for the most important mobile performance initiatives. As discussed in prior quarters, these accelerated investments will moderate our margins in the short-term, but will position us very well for fiscal year '13.
Sales and technical integration with dynaTrace continues to proceed successfully. Sales collaboration, that's already created opportunities in new accounts and cross-selling opportunities with existing customers. We're also introducing dynaTrace to the partner channel. Technical integration is proceeding quickly as Compuware launched Gomez 360° Web Load Testing in September. This solution combines Gomez and dynaTrace to radically improve time-to-market for web-based apps.
The dynaTrace 4.0 release and Gomez release has include additional integration that allows customers to trace individual transactions from the user devices through the cloud and data center all the way to the specific lines of code in the application. dynaTrace's unique capabilities also strengthened our on-premise offering for the code-level detail application teams need.
With dynaTrace, we are winning projects we would have lost before and competing in projects where we would have been left out. We're very optimistic about our momentum and strategy in this space, recently validated by our leadership position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for the APM market. We're offering our customers best-in-class solutions in key point areas that cause them pain today. We also have a complete solution that allows senior management to cope with new cloud-based universe that they have to face tomorrow.
Our partner organization remains a critical component of our growth strategy. Foremost, our partners provide us with additional skill and capacity to meet market demands. Additionally, our partners create new opportunities for market innovation, expanding our ability to deliver disruptive solutions. Finally, our partners, particularly managed service providers and cloud service providers, are increasingly becoming direct customers as they make buying decisions for the thousands of customers they represent.
During Q2, service providers were active with our APM offerings as Cable and Wireless alone closed 11 transactions, nearly 1/4 of the world's top consumers of service providers are now running on Compuware APM solutions. We've achieved this success, which touches some of the world's largest companies in a single year.
We have 22 more deals in progress in managed service providers. We are finalizing 8 new go-to market offerings with partners like Sam's [ph], Cable&Wireless, Computer Sciences Corporation, Cisco and Accenture with an emphasis on our on-premise solutions. Cisco continues to be a star in the partner universe with significant closed business this year, and the pipeline for Q3 looks even stronger. More than 400 Cisco sales professionals are now trained on Compuware APM Solutions; 4 Cisco Unified Computing System partners are now signed on to Compuware Partners, with 2 contracts pending and 19 more in qualification.
Compuware's professional services business unit had another strong quarter, with the revenues up 15% from Q2 last year to $40 million. We have significantly increased our services segment contribution margin from last year to 20% from 16%. Our specialized competencies in mobile application development, global application sourcing, telematics and cloud implementation and management will continue to drive profitable revenue in the quarters ahead.
Covisint had an outstanding Q2 with $18 million in revenue, a 44% increase over the prior year. Contribution margin was minus 13% as we continue to invest in the business. Covisint's unique value proposition spans industries that need to connect online with customers, suppliers and partners. By simply and securely managing these engagements in the cloud, Covisint has become the platform of choice for the healthcare and automotive industries with emerging success in a few other industry segments.
In the healthcare arena, we are experiencing a transition away from state-based health information exchanges as Medicare reimbursement models are shifting to give advantages to care coordination networks and accountable care organizations. This direct-to-the-market philosophy in healthcare to points of entry where we have strong competitive advantages. In Q2, we launched the first operational Beacon Community Health Information Exchange in the country. This HIE links 1,600 providers and patients to monitor and improve care. We also signed a strategic partnership with BlueCross BlueShield Association to deliver a new marketplace with healthcare services nationally for the 39 Blue's plans. Additionally, we launched one of the largest private Health Information Exchanges in the country at Baylor Health Systems.
Our non-healthcare business remain strong as we signed a major portal deal with one of the largest global automotive companies in Q2. This portal will provide an engagement platform for the automotive companies business worldwide.
We continue to expand in the oil and gas industry as well. In Q2, we extended an agreement with the second largest global oil company that services sole provider of all external identity management services. We are taking all of the necessary steps to conduct and carve an IPO Covisint. As we evaluate timing, we have independent confirmation from financial advisers that we could achieve $1 billion valuation in late Q1 or Q2 next year, given our current growth rate. We look forward to announcing the underwriters in the near future.
The Uniface business unit had another strong quarter delivering $12 million in revenue, an 11% increase over Q2 last year, and a 57% contribution margin. Uniface continues to enjoy the highly profitable resurgence based upon rapid development of rich internet and cloud-based apps.
The Changepoint business unit produced total revenues of $11 million in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Contribution margin was flat, a major improvement from minus 18% last year in Q2. The business unit continues to benefit from its strong focus on helping technology, professional services companies increase engagement profitability.
In terms of guidance, Compuware is revising its full-year projections for EPS to a range of $0.47 to $0.50. The reasons for this are as follows: First, we have a much stronger dollar against the euro, which has a negative impact on our model. Second, with a new subscription-based dynaTrace UEM solution that was just released, we will see a higher percentage of ratable deals, which obviously means  more revenue will go into deferred. Third, although second half APM pipeline is strong, it will not make up for the slower-than-expected growth of APM in the first half.
Our revenue guidance is now $1.04 billion in total revenue for the fiscal year. For Q3, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. We will provide more detailed guidance in our Financial Analyst and Investor Day in December. Thank you. Joe?"

Now that I've been at Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today, I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observations.As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at",1030,"Thanks, Bob. Now that I've been at Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today, I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observations.
As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at Deloitte. As a partner, I managed a number of aspects of Deloitte's business on a local, regional and national level. I served on Deloitte's board and I managed Deloitte's strategic sales organization. And just prior to my departure, I ran the Michigan practice for Deloitte, which include all businesses from auditing to consulting.
I also had been an adviser to Compuware for more than 20 years before joining the company. As for my observations of the business, let me start by saying that I'm very excited about being part of this organization. We've got a great leadership team, a terrific portfolio of businesses and outstanding solutions and services that are in high demand in the market.
For instance, one of our core growth drivers, Covisint, is at the forefront of a potential new category in Platform-as-a-Service, multi-enterprise collaboration, and is a pace setter with its secure authentication capabilities. Clearly, Covisint is in a league of its own. And with the ever-growing need for secure online collaboration in just about every industry you can think of, we truly believe Covisint's potential is boundless.
Of course, APM is our key growth driver and is receiving a great deal of our investment focus. As we see this business is growing substantially and ultimately becoming Compuware's largest. One thing that became readily apparent to me upon joining Compuware is that we have the solution portfolio and the underlying strategy to absolutely own the APM market.
We are light-years ahead of the competition in terms of our ability to help customers not only to solve their business application performance problems, but more so to avoid them altogether. And unlike the competition, we can do this regardless of whether the application resides behind a firewall or in the cloud.
Furthermore, our position in market is enviable. Not only do we possess the best-in-breed solutions across the entire application delivery chain, but as the cloud expands and becomes even more disruptive, organizations will need complete end-to-end solutions to ensure optimal performance of their business-critical applications. And as you know, that plays right into our wheelhouse.
Our recent acquisition of dynaTrace further cements our position as the undisputed leader in APM. And through internal innovation as well as through additional acquisition, we fully intend on remaining on top of the hill in the APM market. In terms of our general acquisition strategy, we'll continue to look for the right opportunities at the right price to build up the core aspects of our application performance management solutions.
Of course, I also understand that the strength and tremendous cash flow provided by our mainframe business fuels our growth objectives. We see the mainframe continuing to be a very viable business both currently and in the years to come. As I mentioned, as a consultant at Deloitte, I was very involved in the Compuware business. And over that span, I often heard rumors of the imminent demise of the mainframe as a computing platform. But I think it's safe to say that, that's certainly not the case.
From our perspective, while our mainframe results can be rather lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, the business itself has proven to be quite resilient and if anything, we see a bright future for the mainframe. With the rapid expansion of cloud computing and mobile applications, which in turn generate tremendous amounts of data and transactions that need to be processed, the mainframe, due to its stability and security, will continue to be a core component of companies, particularly large enterprises' computing strategies. This dynamic bodes well for the mainframe, and because of the strength of our industry-leading solutions as well as our unique ability to support enterprise initiatives in the cloud bodes well for Compuware too.
Now from an operating standpoint, we're becoming very focused on margins, we have some work yet to do here, as we are not quite as lean and crisp in this area as we need to be. However, with the proper focus, we can certainly make great strides in this regard while driving focused investments in those areas that will produce the highest returns. This kind of focus is critical in achieving our corporate goals and reaching our tremendous potential.
That said, there are some areas we will address to enhance our ability to reduce costs. Some of the key areas we'll be looking at will include our customer acquisition process, our sales productivity, quality and customer satisfaction and our overall cost of infrastructure, moving to a more virtual work environment, where possible, as an example.
Over the coming year, we'll focus on optimizing these areas and we'll fully expect to see solid margin improvements in the future. We'll share more details about this with you on December 8 in New York. So stay tuned, more to come.
As for how I'm filling my days, I spent the last 3 months coming up to speed on our businesses, spending most of that time in the office with our people, learning as much as I can. However, as an ex-consultant, I'm getting a little antsy, and I want to be out, engaged with our customers and with the analyst community. Therefore, I plan on doing that in the coming months. This will be tremendously valuable in helping me understand how our customers use and value solutions while allowing me to learn firsthand what they find important and what they need to be successful.
Additionally, getting out on the road will allow me to live a bit in the field with our sales team, the face of Compuware to the market. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about the business and about our prospects. Most of the pieces are already in place. Now it's our job to go out and execute. Personally and professionally, I can't imagine being in a better situation and I look forward to helping lead Compuware to new heights. Laura?"

Overall, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of fiscal year '12. Operating cash flow for Q2 was approximately $16.6 million, bringing us to $31.8 million for the first half of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow for the year to come in between $160 million and $175 million.
Q2 operating expenses were approximately $222.5 million dollars. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to currency and the expenses associated with the purchase and operation of dynaTrace. We expect total operating expenses for the year to be between $880 million and $890 million. As we've often discussed, expense management is a critical facet of our strategic plan. We continue to strive to keep costs in check while maintaining a level of investment necessary to ensure our growth areas reach their full potential.
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q2, we repurchased approximately 422,000 shares for about $3.3 million. Going forward, we will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
In terms of our current debt position, as of September 30, our long-term debt balance was approximately $126 million. We continue to anticipate repaying the majority of this obligation by the end of the fiscal year.
And finally, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40.6% due to a deferred tax adjustment. In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39%, dropping to 30% in Q4 when we expect to receive final settlement of certain IRS exams [ph] . Overall, our effective tax rate for the year is now expected to be approximately 35%.
The second quarter was another clear indicator of the incredible progress we have made and are making across the company as we position Compuware for substantial growth in the quarters to come. Lisa?"

I thought we were -- it was just an education issue, but when we integrated the sales organizations, we basically put all of the 3, and then some, best-in-class solutions into their sales kit bag. And so now, a traditional Gomez rep could sell everything and it led to a certain amount of distraction, obviously, training issues and above and beyond that. The second thing that happened is upon the dynaTrace acquisition, there were some positioning clarification between our existing on-premise solutions and the dynaTrace solutions that had to occur, number one, with our existing sales force and number two, with the marketplace. And so, what it did is it created some extended sales cycles. Our -- when we've lost any deals above normal, so the success rates continue, we just had some extensions in the deals that we had So with those 2 factors, we've now made sure that we've got a focus back in the sales organization. We've already made those slight adjustments. So if the Gomez rep was used to selling Gomez, they're back at selling Gomez, SaaS [ph] . And that continues, obviously, with the dynaTrace team and with the agent list, the on-premise team. So with that, we get back to the sales execution that we had expected. We're already seeing that in the pipeline and then commit for the coming quarters and we're working, over the last 60 days, we've been working over time and clarifying the position difference between what dynaTrace can do and what the on premise Vantage can do. So we're obviously very confident that the second half of the year with all the data that we can see is going to return us back to growth rates and that's why we're very much looking forward to December to sharing some of that with you."

And probably the biggest growth ramp there is with those existing 2 because it's all about adoption now, and especially in this new world of consumption. Consumerization of IT and consumption economics, it's all adoption. And so as we get more wins and use cases, that revenue and uptake will continue to happen. We're getting quite a bit of interest from financial services and travel services organizations, especially those with franchisee models and sort of local retail services of their company and trying to collaborate across that franchise model. We've got some very large projects going on there. We talked about the subsegment of the connected vehicle. And interestingly enough, a couple of these initiatives are turning into, instead of pure B-to-B plays there -- as companies now look directly to the consumer to sell their goods and services, it's having an impact on what we're seeing in the pipeline. Meaning, we typically get employees of various companies or physicians, various healthcare systems adopting the Covisint platform. What we're now modeling is just the public, the consumers and the rapid uptick of consumers of this platform. And so that, that can have a pretty large spiking impact on the number of ITs that we manage globally in the future."

Compuware posted a solid Q2 featuring year-over-year revenue growth of more than 15% to $261 million, reaching strong momentum in all top line revenue categories. Software license fees increased more than 35%  year-over-year to $62 million, maintenance and subscription fees grew 5% year-over-year to $128 million, driven by our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional customer value at every level of the business.
Professional services revenue increased nearly 16% year-over-year to $53 million as our offerings in high demand areas like mobility, virtualization and cloud-based technologies drive new business. At $0.10 per share, we're pleased with this level of earnings, but we have the opportunity to do much better.
To more effectively leverage our positive operating results, we're applying a laser focus to improving margins, a topic on which Joe will provide more color later in the call. Our recently completed 3-year planning process gives me great optimism that we can substantially improve company margins by fiscal year '14. We'll provide additional details around our margin and revenue plans for next 3 years at our financial analyst and investor day on December 8 in New York City.
As with the last quarter, I will share details with you on the performance of these business units. The mainframe business unit produced Q2 revenues of $118 million and 80% contribution margin, revenues were up 16% year-over-year. Looking forward, 2 of our top 15 mainframe renewals have closed with 4 more expected this quarter. Given these business and market conditions, we're revising our guidance for this fiscal year to show a slight growth in total mainframe revenue. We also believe that soon with dynaTrace's unique pure path capability extending into the mainframe, we have the potential to help the world's largest mainframe organizations understand the specific load impact of Web, mobile and cloud-based applications on their mainframe systems. The dynaTrace team is collaborating with the original core Abend-AID team on doing -- bringing this solution to market. We hope to have the solution in the field by the end of the calendar year.
The Compuware APM business unit including dynaTrace produced $63 million of revenue in Q2, with a margin comparable to Q1 at minus 27%. Total revenues, including dynaTrace, grew 11% year-over-year. As we have now integrated and sell the dynaTrace and on-premise solutions together, we have combined them in our financial statements. With dynaTrace on-premise license revenues were essentially flat compared to a strong Q2 last year at $18 million. Subscription revenues increased about 5% year-over-year from Q2 last year to $19 million. With consistent win rates and a clear lead over the competition, our APM business has seen a remarkable uptick in overall pipeline, particularly related to dynaTrace. The overall dynaTrace pipeline forecast at the close of fiscal year has grown 128% since the acquisition date. In the last few weeks, the Compuware sales team has added 103 new dynaTrace opportunities to the pipeline.
We're still evaluating when this activity will result in closed agreements, but we are working hard to optimize our results. We provide a complete dynaTrace training to the entire APM sales team, and we will continue to monitor pipeline growth weekly. For the fiscal year, including dynaTrace, we expect to deliver a nearly 35% increase in combined APM new license.
Our key investments are marginalizing the competition and extending our lead in growing segments. By building out our APM global platform, integration with dynaTrace, Web load testing, mobile and streaming capabilities, we have leapfrogged the competition.
Our mobile capabilities, in particular, are leading industry. Because of industry first like mobile customer conversion analytics, integration with Google Mobile Page Speed and the world's largest global performance network, customers are choosing Compuware for the most important mobile performance initiatives. As discussed in prior quarters, these accelerated investments will moderate our margins in the short-term, but will position us very well for fiscal year '13.
Sales and technical integration with dynaTrace continues to proceed successfully. Sales collaboration, that's already created opportunities in new accounts and cross-selling opportunities with existing customers. We're also introducing dynaTrace to the partner channel. Technical integration is proceeding quickly as Compuware launched Gomez 360° Web Load Testing in September. This solution combines Gomez and dynaTrace to radically improve time-to-market for web-based apps.
The dynaTrace 4.0 release and Gomez release has include additional integration that allows customers to trace individual transactions from the user devices through the cloud and data center all the way to the specific lines of code in the application. dynaTrace's unique capabilities also strengthened our on-premise offering for the code-level detail application teams need.
With dynaTrace, we are winning projects we would have lost before and competing in projects where we would have been left out. We're very optimistic about our momentum and strategy in this space, recently validated by our leadership position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for the APM market. We're offering our customers best-in-class solutions in key point areas that cause them pain today. We also have a complete solution that allows senior management to cope with new cloud-based universe that they have to face tomorrow.
Our partner organization remains a critical component of our growth strategy. Foremost, our partners provide us with additional skill and capacity to meet market demands. Additionally, our partners create new opportunities for market innovation, expanding our ability to deliver disruptive solutions. Finally, our partners, particularly managed service providers and cloud service providers, are increasingly becoming direct customers as they make buying decisions for the thousands of customers they represent.
During Q2, service providers were active with our APM offerings as Cable and Wireless alone closed 11 transactions, nearly 1/4 of the world's top consumers of service providers are now running on Compuware APM solutions. We've achieved this success, which touches some of the world's largest companies in a single year.
We have 22 more deals in progress in managed service providers. We are finalizing 8 new go-to market offerings with partners like Sam's [ph], Cable&Wireless, Computer Sciences Corporation, Cisco and Accenture with an emphasis on our on-premise solutions. Cisco continues to be a star in the partner universe with significant closed business this year, and the pipeline for Q3 looks even stronger. More than 400 Cisco sales professionals are now trained on Compuware APM Solutions; 4 Cisco Unified Computing System partners are now signed on to Compuware Partners, with 2 contracts pending and 19 more in qualification.
Compuware's professional services business unit had another strong quarter, with the revenues up 15% from Q2 last year to $40 million. We have significantly increased our services segment contribution margin from last year to 20% from 16%. Our specialized competencies in mobile application development, global application sourcing, telematics and cloud implementation and management will continue to drive profitable revenue in the quarters ahead.
Covisint had an outstanding Q2 with $18 million in revenue, a 44% increase over the prior year. Contribution margin was minus 13% as we continue to invest in the business. Covisint's unique value proposition spans industries that need to connect online with customers, suppliers and partners. By simply and securely managing these engagements in the cloud, Covisint has become the platform of choice for the healthcare and automotive industries with emerging success in a few other industry segments.
In the healthcare arena, we are experiencing a transition away from state-based health information exchanges as Medicare reimbursement models are shifting to give advantages to care coordination networks and accountable care organizations. This direct-to-the-market philosophy in healthcare to points of entry where we have strong competitive advantages. In Q2, we launched the first operational Beacon Community Health Information Exchange in the country. This HIE links 1,600 providers and patients to monitor and improve care. We also signed a strategic partnership with BlueCross BlueShield Association to deliver a new marketplace with healthcare services nationally for the 39 Blue's plans. Additionally, we launched one of the largest private Health Information Exchanges in the country at Baylor Health Systems.
Our non-healthcare business remain strong as we signed a major portal deal with one of the largest global automotive companies in Q2. This portal will provide an engagement platform for the automotive companies business worldwide.
We continue to expand in the oil and gas industry as well. In Q2, we extended an agreement with the second largest global oil company that services sole provider of all external identity management services. We are taking all of the necessary steps to conduct and carve an IPO Covisint. As we evaluate timing, we have independent confirmation from financial advisers that we could achieve $1 billion valuation in late Q1 or Q2 next year, given our current growth rate. We look forward to announcing the underwriters in the near future.
The Uniface business unit had another strong quarter delivering $12 million in revenue, an 11% increase over Q2 last year, and a 57% contribution margin. Uniface continues to enjoy the highly profitable resurgence based upon rapid development of rich internet and cloud-based apps.
The Changepoint business unit produced total revenues of $11 million in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Contribution margin was flat, a major improvement from minus 18% last year in Q2. The business unit continues to benefit from its strong focus on helping technology, professional services companies increase engagement profitability.
In terms of guidance, Compuware is revising its full-year projections for EPS to a range of $0.47 to $0.50. The reasons for this are as follows: First, we have a much stronger dollar against the euro, which has a negative impact on our model. Second, with a new subscription-based dynaTrace UEM solution that was just released, we will see a higher percentage of ratable deals, which obviously means  more revenue will go into deferred. Third, although second half APM pipeline is strong, it will not make up for the slower-than-expected growth of APM in the first half.
Our revenue guidance is now $1.04 billion in total revenue for the fiscal year. For Q3, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. We will provide more detailed guidance in our Financial Analyst and Investor Day in December. Thank you. Joe?"
26883,141330496,175846,"Compuware Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Compuware Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Now that I've been at Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today, I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observations.As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at",1030,"Thanks, Bob. Now that I've been at Compuware for a bit over 3 months, I thought today, I'll take the opportunity to introduce myself and share some of my initial observations.
As a way of a little background before joining Compuware, I spend 26 years at Deloitte. As a partner, I managed a number of aspects of Deloitte's business on a local, regional and national level. I served on Deloitte's board and I managed Deloitte's strategic sales organization. And just prior to my departure, I ran the Michigan practice for Deloitte, which include all businesses from auditing to consulting.
I also had been an adviser to Compuware for more than 20 years before joining the company. As for my observations of the business, let me start by saying that I'm very excited about being part of this organization. We've got a great leadership team, a terrific portfolio of businesses and outstanding solutions and services that are in high demand in the market.
For instance, one of our core growth drivers, Covisint, is at the forefront of a potential new category in Platform-as-a-Service, multi-enterprise collaboration, and is a pace setter with its secure authentication capabilities. Clearly, Covisint is in a league of its own. And with the ever-growing need for secure online collaboration in just about every industry you can think of, we truly believe Covisint's potential is boundless.
Of course, APM is our key growth driver and is receiving a great deal of our investment focus. As we see this business is growing substantially and ultimately becoming Compuware's largest. One thing that became readily apparent to me upon joining Compuware is that we have the solution portfolio and the underlying strategy to absolutely own the APM market.
We are light-years ahead of the competition in terms of our ability to help customers not only to solve their business application performance problems, but more so to avoid them altogether. And unlike the competition, we can do this regardless of whether the application resides behind a firewall or in the cloud.
Furthermore, our position in market is enviable. Not only do we possess the best-in-breed solutions across the entire application delivery chain, but as the cloud expands and becomes even more disruptive, organizations will need complete end-to-end solutions to ensure optimal performance of their business-critical applications. And as you know, that plays right into our wheelhouse.
Our recent acquisition of dynaTrace further cements our position as the undisputed leader in APM. And through internal innovation as well as through additional acquisition, we fully intend on remaining on top of the hill in the APM market. In terms of our general acquisition strategy, we'll continue to look for the right opportunities at the right price to build up the core aspects of our application performance management solutions.
Of course, I also understand that the strength and tremendous cash flow provided by our mainframe business fuels our growth objectives. We see the mainframe continuing to be a very viable business both currently and in the years to come. As I mentioned, as a consultant at Deloitte, I was very involved in the Compuware business. And over that span, I often heard rumors of the imminent demise of the mainframe as a computing platform. But I think it's safe to say that, that's certainly not the case.
From our perspective, while our mainframe results can be rather lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, the business itself has proven to be quite resilient and if anything, we see a bright future for the mainframe. With the rapid expansion of cloud computing and mobile applications, which in turn generate tremendous amounts of data and transactions that need to be processed, the mainframe, due to its stability and security, will continue to be a core component of companies, particularly large enterprises' computing strategies. This dynamic bodes well for the mainframe, and because of the strength of our industry-leading solutions as well as our unique ability to support enterprise initiatives in the cloud bodes well for Compuware too.
Now from an operating standpoint, we're becoming very focused on margins, we have some work yet to do here, as we are not quite as lean and crisp in this area as we need to be. However, with the proper focus, we can certainly make great strides in this regard while driving focused investments in those areas that will produce the highest returns. This kind of focus is critical in achieving our corporate goals and reaching our tremendous potential.
That said, there are some areas we will address to enhance our ability to reduce costs. Some of the key areas we'll be looking at will include our customer acquisition process, our sales productivity, quality and customer satisfaction and our overall cost of infrastructure, moving to a more virtual work environment, where possible, as an example.
Over the coming year, we'll focus on optimizing these areas and we'll fully expect to see solid margin improvements in the future. We'll share more details about this with you on December 8 in New York. So stay tuned, more to come.
As for how I'm filling my days, I spent the last 3 months coming up to speed on our businesses, spending most of that time in the office with our people, learning as much as I can. However, as an ex-consultant, I'm getting a little antsy, and I want to be out, engaged with our customers and with the analyst community. Therefore, I plan on doing that in the coming months. This will be tremendously valuable in helping me understand how our customers use and value solutions while allowing me to learn firsthand what they find important and what they need to be successful.
Additionally, getting out on the road will allow me to live a bit in the field with our sales team, the face of Compuware to the market. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about the business and about our prospects. Most of the pieces are already in place. Now it's our job to go out and execute. Personally and professionally, I can't imagine being in a better situation and I look forward to helping lead Compuware to new heights. Laura?"

Overall, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of fiscal year '12. Operating cash flow for Q2 was approximately $16.6 million, bringing us to $31.8 million for the first half of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow for the year to come in between $160 million and $175 million.
Q2 operating expenses were approximately $222.5 million dollars. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to currency and the expenses associated with the purchase and operation of dynaTrace. We expect total operating expenses for the year to be between $880 million and $890 million. As we've often discussed, expense management is a critical facet of our strategic plan. We continue to strive to keep costs in check while maintaining a level of investment necessary to ensure our growth areas reach their full potential.
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q2, we repurchased approximately 422,000 shares for about $3.3 million. Going forward, we will continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
In terms of our current debt position, as of September 30, our long-term debt balance was approximately $126 million. We continue to anticipate repaying the majority of this obligation by the end of the fiscal year.
And finally, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40.6% due to a deferred tax adjustment. In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39%, dropping to 30% in Q4 when we expect to receive final settlement of certain IRS exams [ph] . Overall, our effective tax rate for the year is now expected to be approximately 35%.
The second quarter was another clear indicator of the incredible progress we have made and are making across the company as we position Compuware for substantial growth in the quarters to come. Lisa?"

I thought we were -- it was just an education issue, but when we integrated the sales organizations, we basically put all of the 3, and then some, best-in-class solutions into their sales kit bag. And so now, a traditional Gomez rep could sell everything and it led to a certain amount of distraction, obviously, training issues and above and beyond that. The second thing that happened is upon the dynaTrace acquisition, there were some positioning clarification between our existing on-premise solutions and the dynaTrace solutions that had to occur, number one, with our existing sales force and number two, with the marketplace. And so, what it did is it created some extended sales cycles. Our -- when we've lost any deals above normal, so the success rates continue, we just had some extensions in the deals that we had So with those 2 factors, we've now made sure that we've got a focus back in the sales organization. We've already made those slight adjustments. So if the Gomez rep was used to selling Gomez, they're back at selling Gomez, SaaS [ph] . And that continues, obviously, with the dynaTrace team and with the agent list, the on-premise team. So with that, we get back to the sales execution that we had expected. We're already seeing that in the pipeline and then commit for the coming quarters and we're working, over the last 60 days, we've been working overtime and clarifying the position difference between what dynaTrace can do and what the on premise Vantage can do. So we're obviously very confident that the second half of the year with all the data that we can see is going to return us back to growth rates and that's why we're very much looking forward to December to sharing some of that with you."

And what's going on there is that besides the -- what you think is a fairly interesting opportunity in automotive is actually a huge new market bursting open for Covisint around connected vehicles, and we have over a handful, so 6 to 8 different opportunities. We're dealing with major car or transportation organizations around authentication in the cloud to connected vehicle platforms. So that's driving a lot of sales activity, which quite frankly, there really isn't competition there. The healthcare stuff is self-explanatory, right? There is a lot of federal compliance issues moving where the money is coming from and what the compliance issues are, but overall, the problem is going to get solved. For the 20% of the other business, it's quite remarkable, right? We're heading into this new era of what Geoffrey Moore refers to as systems and engagement, which are really businesses coming to terms with collaboration as we've been seeing it from business to business taking advantage of business consumer capabilities to solving problems never been solved before, and those opportunities are almost limitless.

The 2 things that happened -- the sales organization is we moved everybody together from the Gomez and the on-premise group in a single sales structure. That continues to be in place. But what we also did is we put all the APM solutions in their bag to sell, and that created a distraction from what they were good at and the people who they were talking to, and their expertise and positioning and winning against traditional competition. So we've subsequently fixed that. The second thing that happened with the acquisition of dynaTrace, and although the dynaTrace demand has far exceeded, far exceeded our expectations in the field so we're dealing with that from the sales execution perspective. But it also added length to the sales cycle because there was some confusion at the beginning about where dynaTrace fit versus the Gomez on-premise solution fit. We've since done a substantial amount of training globally for our sales organization to clarify that. We're doing a lot of outreach programs to the marketplace to clarify that. And I think we're in good shape moving forward. But it did have an impact on the growth rates in the first half.

We're getting quite a bit of interest from financial services and travel services organizations, especially those with franchisee models and sort of local retail services of their company and trying to collaborate across that franchise model. We've got some very large projects going on there. We talked about the subsegment of the connected vehicle. And interestingly enough, a couple of these initiatives are turning into, instead of pure B-to-B plays there -- as companies now look directly to the consumer to sell their goods and services, it's having an impact on what we're seeing in the pipeline. Meaning, we typically get employees of various companies or physicians, various healthcare systems adopting the Covisint platform.
