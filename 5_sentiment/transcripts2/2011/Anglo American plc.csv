Anglo American has certainly delivered the strong 2010 performance on the back of rising demand and higher prices, but those effects have been amplified by the excellent operating performance by our businesses. 
I've now visited all our key business units and all our major projects around the world, and I am deeply impressed by the professionalism of our people and by their tier commitment and drive to achieve our strategic goals. And this, I believe, is certainly reflected in today's financial results.
Turning to the dividend. The Board believes it is prudent to provide shareholders with a dividend that they can rely on through the cycles. Against this background, the Board has proposed a final dividend of $0.40 per share, thereby establishing our new base annual dividend per share of $0.65. Taking into account our substantial capital investment program, future earnings potential and the need for robust balance sheet strength at the times of cyclical loops, any surplus cash thereafter will be distributed to shareholders. 
I will know, ladies and gentlemen, hand over to Cynthia."

It's good to see you again here today, and thank you for coming. I'd like to start by giving you the highlights of what has been a very strong year on all fronts. Then also give you some d",1924,"Thank you very much, John, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's good to see you again here today, and thank you for coming. I'd like to start by giving you the highlights of what has been a very strong year on all fronts. Then also give you some detail on the operational performance of our businesses. Rene will then take you through the financials, and we'll conclude with an update of our major growth projects and a view on the growth that is coming up over the next decade. 
So the highlights. We've had a very strong set of numbers to report. Group operating profit for the year was $9.8 billion, almost double that of the previous year. Underlying earnings were $5 billion and EPS was $4.13, a 93% increase on 2009. Our asset optimization and procurement programs have exceeded all expectations. They have delivered $3 billion very considerably ahead of our target and a year ahead of schedule. And I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on the divestments of our non-core assets with proceeds received so far of $3.3 billion. There's been further headway made today with the announcements that Tarmac Limited and Lafarge U.K. have agreed to combine to create a leading U.K. construction materials company. 
We have an exceptionally strong organic growth outlook both in the immediate term and coming years. In the near term, we will deliver 50% volume growth to 2015 starting with Barro Alto next month. We have a $70 billion project pipeline, and in the next three years alone, we expect to approve a further $16 billion in project CapEx.
And as John, our Chairman, indicated, we're pleased to announce the final dividend will be $0.40 bringing total dividends for the year to $0.65 per share. 
Before we turn to the operating performance for the year, I want to look at safety, and that's because it is a priority for me. Our employees have a right to go home safely at the end of every day. 90% of our sites operated without fatalities during 2010, and we put a lot of hard work into this, and we've seen the number of fatalities decline by 68% in the last four years. In the same period, we've seen 51% improvement in lost time injury rates, but having said that, we lost 14 colleagues on company business in 2010. And this is unacceptable and a strong reminder of the work we still have to do on safety. I am passionately committed to zero harm, and I won't settle for anything less. We're headed in the right direction. Our people do understand what we mean when we talk about safety, and so do the governments and the trade unions. Improving safety is not only the right thing to do, it is at the core of the Anglo American values, and it raises morale. It furthers our relationships with our partners and helps us enormously in the steps we are taking to improve things like productivity.
When we look at how Anglo American has performed, I believe the recovery in our performance reflects the decisive action we took during the worst of the downturn. The decisions we took then to cut cost, to restructure the group, to raise productivity and crucially to maintain investment in our key growth projects without turning to the market for additional capital, these were the right decisions. I'm pleased to say that we are now leveraging the benefits of that discipline. 
To give you some examples. In Metallurgical Coal, we have transformed our productivity performance. Our focus on structure and asset optimization programs has yielded significant benefits with labor productivity at our export mines some 48% above 2008 levels. Long well performance at our premier hard coking coal sites, Moranbah and Capcoal had been a particular focus. We have embedded new long-haul management processes at these sites, which have driven a 50% improvement in long-haul move times and a 23% increase in underground production. As a result of these initiatives, our coking coal production is now almost entirely positioned in the lower half of the industry cost curve. 
In Platinum too, we have continued to make excellent progress in improving our cost position with a majority of our production now in the lower half of the cost curve. We have increased productivity by 23% since 2008 and exceeded our target of 7 square meters per operating employee in 2010. In a business where approximately half of the cost base is labor-related, the strong productivity performance has been fundamental to delivering our production target, while keeping cash, operating cost below inflation.
At the beginning of 2009, we set a $2 billion Asset Optimisation and Procurement target to be delivered by the end of 2011. In July last year, we increased that target by applying it just to the core operations. As you can see today, not only have we substantially surpassed that target, we've done so a full year early. This performance has been achieved throughout the group with every business unit delivering a substantial gain through applying the rigorous disciplines of our AO and Procurement programs. And I'm confident that we're going to unlock further value from Asset Optimisation in particular as we continue to embed and sustain best-in-class practices across all of our businesses. 
What we have here is a snapshot of our clear position as a world-class mining company. We have a well diversified portfolio in the structurally attractive commodities, on which we decided to concentrate. Our commodities are copper, diamond, iron ore, manganese, met coal, nickel, platinum and thermal coal. They will deliver long term through the cycle returns and have strong fundamentals of the most attractive risk return profiles.
We have strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from non-core disposals of $3.3 billion. We have our commodity business units positioned where we want them, driving value and moving further down the cost curve and a world-class project pipeline. 
Let me now put those achievements in the context of our strategic path. We've delivered the cost management and improved productivity mindsets I've talked about. The stronger balance sheet, the good progress on our divestments of non-core assets. We're delivering our near-term growth that I shall cover in some detail in a few minutes. I'm looking beyond the next wave of project growth. We have a broad ranging project pipeline with potential to double production over the next decade. These are resources that we already own that our tactical and exploration teams continue to identify, to refine and to advance; and together, they provide us with tremendous growth optionality for the long term.
Let's talk with Copper now turning to our business units. Our operating profit is up 40% to $2.8 billion, reflecting record average copper prices for the year peaking at $4.42 per pound. In line with our expectations, our production was marginally down as a result of the planned lower copper grades at Los Bronces and Collahuasi. And we also saw two separate strikes at Collahuasi during the year. Our low-cost long life brownfield expansion project at Los Bronces is on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter of this year, adding an additional 278,000 tons per annum over the first three years, more than a 40% increase in our attributable copper production. 
In Nickel, the division contributed just under $100 million in the year, driven by strong prices and an increase in production. The world-class Barro Alto project is on schedule for the first metal at the end of next month, and at full capacity, this will double our current nickel production.
Our Platinum business generate $837 million of operating profit. Production was better than expectations with refined platinum production of 2.57 million ounces up over 118,000 ounces or 5% with the strong performance from our own mine operations. Cost inflation will, however, continue to present the business with challenges this year. Mining inflation remained well above South African CPI during 2010, and this differential is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. This year, we will see another 25% increase in electricity tariffs, and there are further waste negotiations starting in the first half of this year and coming into effect on the 1st of July. Continued aggressive cost management and increased labor productivity enabled the business to keep cash, operating cost increases below prevailing inflation, and that is the approach that we intend to apply going forward.
Turning to Iron Ore. Kumba reported a record financial performance delivering an operating profit of $3.7 billion, driven by a 92% rise in realized export prices and a 6% increase in export volumes to 36.1 million tons. This was partially offset by the 15% strengthening of the rand against the U.S. dollar. And as expected, rand unit cost increased 15% driven by a 24% increase in waste stripping, partially offset by a 3% increase in mining productivity. Total production at Sishen increased by 5% to 41.3 million tons. The JIG plant achieved 13.3 million tons of production for the year, 300,000 tons above the nameplate capacity. Improvement in global steel demand drove higher sales volumes and prices at Samancor, with operating up 167% to $382 million. 
Our Met Coal business had a good year with operating profit of $783 million. We've been able to optimize our product mix with a higher proportion to our other sales coming from the premium pricing, hard coking met coal. We achieved record export met coal sales up an impressive 30%. The Queensland coal industry has experienced a period of record cycle and events and floods, which have impacted both our open cut, as well as underground operations. But despite this unprecedented disruption, our Met Coal business delivered record total production and record Met Coal production is up 16% on the prior year, and this translated into record sales up 30% on the prior year. All our mines have now resumed normal operations, and we will ramp up the planned production in the second half as a result of early mitigation actions taken. Looking at the future growth prospects. Feasibility continues for our Grosvenor project with approval expected over the next 12 to 18 months, and this is forecast to produce 4.3 million tons per annum of premium hard coking coal. 
Turning to Thermal Coal. Our performance in South Africa and Colombia was broadly in line with 2009. We saw a strong recovery in Thermal Coal prices and increased export volumes from South Africa, offset by a strong rand. Production in South Africa was at a similar level to last year with Mafube ramping up to full production offsetting a decline in volumes at our older mines. Zibulo is close to completion and well on its way to commercial production levels, and Cerrejon delivered a strong operational performance, maintaining production, unit cost and profit levels in spite of significant ramps in the second half.
And finally, turning to Diamonds. The business had a very, very impressive performance, the highest EBITDA in 10 years with sales up 57%. There was a strong recovery in demand and in prices for rough and polished diamonds, and we're seeing increased purchasing in retail markets in China and India, and rough diamond prices ended the year close to where they were before the economic crisis. I'm pleased to say the work that we did on cost base containment have really paid off. We maintained the lower cost base approximately $500 million lower than 2008 despite bringing back online significant production. 
Now Rene will take us through the financials."

We're j",1041,"Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, they were also based on operational performance. We're just below 30%. We got the benefit of the higher contribution from both De Beers and Kumba, which had a lower tax rate, more than the teens of higher tax  rate in Chile. For 2011, we are predicting the tax rate around 32%.
CapEx of $5 billion, lower than the guidance we gave you the beginning of the year due to the delay of securing the license in Brazil for the Minas Rio project. Net debt down to $7.4 billion. The strong cash flow generation but also the progress on that divestment of the non-core asset, which are highlighted on the next slide. Total divestment and also $3.3 billion for 2008. We completed a $2.8 billion by the end of 2008 net debt, and we have received $0.5 billion since the beginning of the year.
We'd like also to highlight that these divestment we structured in a very tax effective way with limited capital gain tax of $100 million. We announced stay in our restructuring program this morning with a combination of Tarmac U.K. asset with Lafarge U.K. asset in a 50-50. John mentioned that will enable us to be in a much stronger position through this very challenging U.K. market. The two businesses are very complementary. Lafarge has a very strong position in cement, while Tarmac has a very strong position in aggregate asphalt and ready mix. We expect the combination to generate around $100 million of synergies over the two years following the completion of the collection, which we will present to you 30% but pretty in EBITDA compared to the pro forma EBITDA number for 2010.
Turning to the operating profit reconciliation, and you'll see on this slide how significant was the price variance in excess of $5.7 billion. I will go into more detail for each variances. I just want to highlight on this slide that the volume variance of $100 million is at last year's margin. If you are using the accounting margin of 2010, it would be $250 million. We'd like also to highlight the increase in the contribution from associate of $718 million due to the increase in contribution from Samancor but also the recovery in. So turning first to the price variance for traded commodities. Copper, $1.2 billion price variance. That includes the many fees of the mark-to-market adjustments in 2010 of $195 million. At the end of December 2010, we had 96,000 tons of copper price at $4.37.
Platinum, and if you look at the Platinum basket price, an increase of 39% from ZAR 14,000 in excess of ZAR 18,000 in 2010. Currently, basket price at ZAR 21,000.
Turning to bulk. And first, Iron Ore, as you know, the market moved to shorter-term pricing specifically a quite early benchmark. In 2010, we sold 30% of our volume on our index base predominantly to Chinese customer. That's probably above what we would expect. We would expect on average to sell 80% of our volume on the benchmark basis and 20% on the spot basis.
Turning to bulk, similar evolution for the metallurgical coal market. For Thermal Coal, in 2010, we still have a five-year contract, which have been priced on a fixed-priced basis. As you can see 40% of the sales at $67 return. That was the last year of this new contract, and in 2011, all the sales will be on the index basis.
Turning to exchange and volume variance. Negative FX variance of $1 billion, $700 million due to the strengthening of the rand and $300 million due to dollar. In terms of volume variance, just want to highlight the decline at copper of 7%. As Cynthia mentioned, due to strikes at Collahuasi, and as expected lower grade at Los Bronces, in 2011, we will get the benefit of the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion, and we expect overall a 10% increase in copper pollution. Metallurgical coal, quite a substantial increase in pollution, 60% all due to a productivity improvement at our long-haul operations in Australia at 14.7 million tons of metallurgical coal. In 2011, as a result of the flooding in Queensland, we expect the pollution around the same 14.7 million tons. In the case of Iron Ore, a 5% increase, and then despite the challenge and the problem we have with cost net we add in the second half of 2010, five months in South Africa. And then you see the increase in pollution at 34% increase in pollution for 2011 to be striking below 14 million carats. 
Turning to the cost side, cash cost increase of 2.1% all due to non-controllable cost at permanently fuel and electricity increase in both South Africa and Chile.
Turning to CapEx and net debt, as I mentioned on my first slide, total CapEx of $5 billion for the full year, $2.3 billion due to the aforementioned project. We expect a ramp-up in CapEx over the next two years now that we have secured the licenses at Minas Rio. CapEx for the next two years will be around $6.5 billion for both 2011 and 2012.
Turning to cash flow and net debt. Cash flow on the right hand side, net debt down to $7.4 billion, and that includes the impact of recapitalizing both on the Platinum and De Beers. Cynthia highlighted potential improvement on both Platinum and De Beers. I want also to highlight that both businesses are in a much stronger position for the balance sheet standpoint, reflecting has enabled debt of ZAR 4.1 billion, which has enabled our Platinum to resume its dividend, and De Beers had debt of $1.2 billion, and we expect to start to repay load in 2011.
Net debt of $7.4 billion. That includes net cash position in South Africa of $1.8 billion and the net debt outside of South Africa of $8.2 billion. We have total debt of $15 billion at the end of December, which no financing maturing in 2011, so a very strong financial position allowing us to pay slightly higher-than-expected final dividend. Thank you."

We see near-term organic growth of 50% by 2015, equating to 7% per year. We will start up a new mining operation every six to nine months over the next few years, and I will provide you detail where we are on the initial four in a moment. 
Over the next three years, we expect to approve projects with a total CapEx value of $16 billion. But let's look beyond the near term to our world-class resource base. As you can see, we have a very impressive growth portfolio, some 60 products spanning our core commodities, major geographies and through the development cycle. In addition to the already approved $17 billion of projects underway, our next wave of projects represent a potential investment of about $53 billion. And as I've already said, this gives us the potential to more than double our production over the next decade.
We're delivering on all our four key projects: Barro Alto and Nickel in Brazil is in the commissioning phase and on schedule for the first metal next month. This project makes use of a proven technology and will provide 41,000 tons per annum of nickel for the first five years at an average of 36,000 tons per annum over the life of mine with a competitive cost position the lower half of the cost curve. Barro Alto has a life of mine in excess of 25 years from an extended resource base, and it will more than double our production for our Nickel business.
Turning to our second project coming on stream this year. The Los Bronces expansion project in Chile is on track for the first production in the fourth quarter. With the expansion, production at Los Bronces is scheduled to increase to 490,000 tons per annum over the first three years of full production and will average 400,000 tons per annum over the first 10 years. At peak production levels, Los Bronces is expected to be the fifth largest-producing copper mining in the world. It has highly attractive cash operating cost, approximately $0.80 per pound and reserves and resources to support of mine life of over 30 years with further expansion potential. Within the Los Bronces area, we have completed 3.6 kilometers of the 8-kilometer exploration tunnel that will provide underground drilling access to explore and to fund the resources at the very sizable and high-quality new discovery at Los Sulfatos. The resource potential was 1.2 billion tons at 1.46% copper. 
In South Africa, we have the Kolomela iron ore project, which at the end of December was 81% complete. It is on track for a second quarter start-up in 2012. By the end of 2013, we expect to be producing 9 million tons of low-cost high-quality seaborne iron ore, and there's potential for further expansion. Once again, we're looking at a very attractive cost position in the lower half of the cost curve. 
And finally, to Minas Rio, our iron ore project in Brazil, scheduled to produce 65 million tons per annum in its first phase. We now have the main licenses that allow us to start the civil work for the beneficiation plant and tailings dam next month. We expect it will take between 27 and 30 months from the start of these works to construct and commission the mine and plant, complete the project and deliver the first ore on shift. As you would expect, there are some other licenses and permits that we will need along the way, but the progress made in 2010 was very significant. 
In December, we announced that we agreed a fixed 25-year iron ore port tariff with our partner LLX. As part of the agreement to secure the long-term tariff arrangements, we will fund the greater share of the development cost of the first phase of the port. This agreement is expected to result in additional capital expenditure attributable to us of about $525 million in relation to the port. The pipeline is progressing well. 87% land access has been secured, up from 54% in January. Two underground river crossings have been completed, one, of which is the longest of its type in Brazil; and pipeline is ahead of schedule. Civil work for the filtration plant are underway and at the port. We started building the iron ore pier and breakwater having completed the 2.9 kilometer lawn main bridge. Through our ongoing expansion, we have increased the total resource volume to 5.3 billion tons, which supports the expansion of project beyond 26.5 million tons. 
Beyond these four projects that are well underway, we are progressing towards approval decisions in relation to the development of two further high-quality growth projects: the 225,000 ton per annum Quellaveco copper project in Peru; and the 4.3 million ton per annum Grosvenor hard coking coal project in Australia. Again, like all our major projects, these are long life and low cost positioned to lower half of the cost curve and with resource base that support long production lives.
Finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the macro economic outlook. At the time of our results last year, there was considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy. Some economists were worried about a potential double-dip in the U.S. and a sharp slowdown in China, but these fears proved unfounded. Over the last year, the world economy has grown more strongly than expected. Crucially, the U.S. economy has improved significantly, and in recent weeks, we've seen evidence of a market acceleration. Stronger consumer spending is supporting GDP growth, and the latest manufacturing ISM survey points to healthy growth early in 2011. With Chinese growth easing slightly, a stronger U.S. economy is vital to sustain in the global economic recovery and demand for our commodities over the next few years. 
As we've seen, there has been some volatility in the economies and commodities in the shorter term, and we expect this to continue. In the longer term, however, the fundamentals for the mining industry look very strong. China, India and other emerging economies are still in the early stages of their catch-up with the advanced economies. As the living standards improve, Asia's middle class will expand dramatically, generating significant gains into spreadable incomes and demand for more consumable durables.
In addition, there should be huge increases in spending on infrastructure to support the development of these economies. U.S. policymakers also recognize the need to step up infrastructure investment. In this environment, we expect continuing robust demand growth for all of our key commodities over the next two decades. The continued urbanization of China will drive demand for our core commodities such as finished steel. Steel consumption per capital has been rising dramatically in China over the last five to 10 years and has caught up with and recently overtaken the U.S. We expect per capita steel consumption in China to reach around 450 to 500 kilograms per capita as urbanization increases to 60% over the next nine to 10 years. In absolute terms, this represents a very significant increase in annual finished steel demand of an additional 250 million tons. And this is very good news for iron ore and metallurgical coal. 
Not only is China embedding a huge point of our core commodities in its infrastructure, there is significant amount of planned urban regeneration and renewal. The scope for growth in demand is significant, and it is perhaps the most surprise that we see the consumption of high value materials of the stainless steel growing at a rapid rate. We believe that we have a good handle on China, and this supports our very constructive outlook for our core commodities.
In summary, the set of results reflects delivery on all fronts. We are achieving operational excellence. We are continuing to drive our businesses down and the cost curves. We have one of the most exciting growth profiles in the industry. We have strengthened our balance sheet. We are making excellent progress on our divestments, and we are very positive about the outlook for our core commodities. This shows that we are in a great position to achieve our ambition to becoming the leading global mining company. The investment, the partner and the employer of choice. Thank you very much everybody for your attention, and we'd now like to take your questions. Thank you."

But clearly, as well, as you point out, we've got a significant growth pipeline. We will prioritize that growth pipeline as per the returns, timing, and it will be on that basis that we will determine the level of dividend going forward. Okay, your second point of questioning is around Platinum. I think that Neville won't say it but I'll say it on behalf of the Platinum group. I think they've done an outstanding job. We've surpassed the target on productivity. We said we were going to reach 7 square meters per employee. We reached 7.06 square meters. We're looking another 7.3 square meters this year and that productivity continuing to ramp up. This is the third year that they've delivered cost virtually flat year-on-year. And I think as I said earlier, given electricity prices increasing by 25%, 26%, given labor increases representing a very substantial part of the underlying cost in the neighborhood of 8%, 9%, it is challenging, but they've done an outstanding job. Neville, you want to just talk and add to do that?"

I think it'll be good for the group to hear a little bit about the progress that we've made because it is quite impressive and will be very helpful, I think to this audience. In terms of your question about productivity, it is quite impressive. We see productivity increases almost across the group starting first with what Seamus has done in Australia followed by what Neville is doing in platinum. Chris is not here, but we've done phenomenally well in Kumba. So it's virtually across the group that we're seeing this kind of gain, and it really comes back to the approach that we're taking around asset optimization, our focus on the operation, every single one benefiting from the global expertise in group. And maybe I could just touch on the asset optimizations because that's really where it's being driven from. We delivered $3 billion of value this past year. And as I said, it's a year ahead of schedule. I have to tell you, frankly, I didn't think we would get to this level so fast. We're now looking at how we further capitalize on this, and I would have to say, and I don't want to give you too much food for thought here, but the further uplift to the group is quite sizable. How are we doing that? Well, in 2010, we performed five operational reviews in asset optimization, targeting and identifying specific opportunities and capitalizing on our technical excellence. Although this is early days from those reviews, we identified about $170 million of value just in those few alone. We're looking to further standardize and implement the measures that we're putting in place and really work our way up the maturity curve to excellence across the group through asset optimization. And I think in procurement as well, we're also I just should mention that because I think the value there has been fantastic and we see a lot more to come. So again, not to oversell the progress that we're making here, but I think it is evidence of the ability to deliver and the focus that everybody has on their operations and moving into a very competitive cost position. And I think the embedded value in the company and the organization across-the-board continues to be quite high. Now to your other question, Minas Rio FOB cost, why don't you, for a few minutes, Walter, just talk about the progress that has been made this last year and what we're doing in the next couple of months? And then I'll touch on the partner administration."

With the mining permit that we've got in August last year and with the installation license for the beneficiation plant we did in December, we are on track now up to start the civil works. We have about 40% of the Earth works completed at the beneficiation plant. We're going to start civiles now in March. So this is all according to our schedule, and we are slightly, I would say slightly ahead of the game in that site. In the pipeline, we have about 87% of the landowners secured. If you look at the state of Rio, where the pipeline is starting, so the pipeline is coming up from the port to the mine. We have about 97% almost finished of the earth works done, about end of January, 100 kilometers of five welded and installed. So about 20% of the whole pipeline is already finished. We at the port the last bit, at the port, we are about two and half months ahead of schedule. We have the bridge ready, the pier is just over half of it done started the breakwater. So all of that is good news, as you said. In terms of operating costs, we still envisage ourselves to be below the $20 status, that is the aim, FOB.

I'd like to start by giving you the highlights of what has been a very strong year on all fronts. Then also give you some detail on the operational performance of our businesses. Rene will then take you through the financials, and we'll conclude with an update of our major growth projects and a view on the growth that is coming up over the next decade. 
So the highlights. We have had a very strong set of numbers to report. Group operating profit for the year was $9.8 billion, almost double that of the previous year. Underlying earnings were $5 billion and EPS was $4.13, a 93% increase on 2009. Our asset optimization and procurement programs have exceeded all expectations. They have delivered $3 billion very considerably ahead of our target and a year ahead of schedule. And I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on the divestments of our non-core assets with proceeds received so far of $3.3 billion. There's been further headway made today with the announcements that Tarmac Limited and Lafarge U.K. have agreed to combine to create a leading U.K. construction materials company. 
We have an exceptionally strong organic growth outlook both in the immediate term and coming years. In the near term, we will deliver 50% volume growth to 2015 starting with Barro Alto next month. We have a $70 billion project pipeline, and in the next three years alone, we expect to approve a further $16 billion in project CapEx.
And as John, our Chairman, indicated, we're pleased to announce that final dividend will be $0.40, bringing total dividends for the year to $0.65 per share. 
Before we turn to the operating performance for the year, I want to look at safety, and that's because it is a priority for me. Our employees have a right to go home safely at the end of every day. 90% of our sites operated without fatalities during 2010, and we put a lot of hard work into this, and we've seen the number of fatalities decline by 68% in the last four years. In the same period, we've seen 51% improvement in lost time injury rates, but having said that, we lost 14 colleagues on company business in 2010. And this is unacceptable and a strong reminder of the work we still have to do on safety. I am passionately committed to zero harm, and I won't settle for anything less.
We're headed in the right direction. Our people do understand what we mean when we talk about safety, and so do the governments and the trade unions. Improving safety is not only the right thing to do, it is at the core of the Anglo American values. And it raises morale. It furthers our relationships with our partners. And helps us enormously in the steps we are taking to improve things like productivity.
When we look at how Anglo American has performed, I believe the recovery in our performance reflects the decisive action we took during the worst of the downturn. The decisions we took then to cut cost, to restructure the group, to raise productivity and crucially to maintain investment in our key growth projects without turning to the market for additional capital, these were the right decisions. I'm pleased to say that we are now leveraging the benefits of that discipline. 
To give you some examples. In Metallurgical Coal, we have transformed our productivity performance. Our focus on structure and asset optimization programs has yielded significant benefits with labor productivity at our export mines some 48% above 2008 levels. Long-haul performance at our premier hard coking coal sites, Moranbah and Capcoal, had been a particular focus. We have embedded new long-haul management processes at these sites, which have driven a 50% improvement in long-haul move times and a 23% increase in underground production. As a result of these initiatives, our coking coal production is now almost entirely positioned in the lower half of the industry cost curve. 
In Platinum too, we have continued to make excellent progress in improving our cost position, with a majority of our production now in the lower half of the cost curve. We have increased productivity by 23% since 2008 and exceeded our target of seven square meters per operating employee in 2010. In a business where approximately half of the cost base is labor-related, the strong productivity performance has been fundamental to delivering our production target, while keeping cash, operating cost below inflation.
At the beginning of 2009, we set a $2 billion Asset Optimisation and Procurement target to be delivered by the end of 2011. In July last year, we increased that target by applying it just to the core operations. As you can see today, not only have we substantially surpassed that target, we've done so a full year early. This performance has been achieved throughout the group with every business unit delivering a substantial gain through applying the rigorous disciplines of our AO and Procurement programs. And I'm confident that we're going to unlock further value from Asset Optimisation in particular as we continue to embed and sustain best-in-class practices across all of our businesses. 
What we have here is a snapshot of our clear position as a world-class mining company. We have a well-diversified portfolio and structurally attractive commodities, on which we decided to concentrate. Our commodities are copper, diamonds, iron ore, manganese, met coal, nickel, platinum and thermal coal. They will deliver long term through the cycle returns and have strong fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles.
We have strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from non-core disposals of $3.3 billion. We have our commodity business units positioned where we want them, driving value and moving further down the cost curve and a world-class project pipeline. 
Let me now put those achievements in the context of our strategic path. We've delivered the cost management and improved productivity mindsets I've talked about. The stronger balance sheet, the good progress on our divestments of non-core assets. We're delivering our near-term growth that I shall cover in some detail in a few minutes. I'm looking beyond the next wave of project growth. We have a broad ranging project pipeline with potential to double production over the next decade. These are resources that we already own that our tactical and exploration teams continue to identify, to refine and to advance. And together, they provide us with tremendous growth optionality for the long term.
Let's start with Copper now turning to our business units. Our operating profit is up 40% to $2.8 billion, reflecting record average copper prices for the year peaking at $4.42 per pound. In line with our expectations, our production was marginally down as a result of the planned lower copper grades at Los Bronces and Collahuasi. And we also saw two separate strikes at Collahuasi during the year. Our low-cost, long-life brownfield expansion project at Los Bronces is on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter of this year, adding an additional 278,000 tons per annum over the first three years, more than a 40% increase in our attributable copper production. 
In Nickel, the division contributed just under $100 million in the year, driven by strong prices and an increase in production. The world-class Barro Alto project is on schedule for the first metal at the end of next month, and at full capacity, this will double our current nickel production.
Our Platinum business generate $837 million of operating profit. Production was better than expectations with refined platinum production of 2.57 million ounces, up over 118,000 ounces or 5%, with the strong performance from our own mine operations. Cost inflation will, however, continue to present the business with challenges this year. Mining inflation remained well above South African CPI during 2010, and this differential is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. This year, we will see another 25% increase in electricity tariffs, and there are further waste negotiations starting in the first half of this year and coming into effect on the 1st of July. Continued aggressive cost management and increased labor productivity enabled the business to keep cash, operating cost increases below prevailing inflation, and that is the approach that we intend to apply going forward.
Turning to Iron Ore. Kumba reported a record financial performance, delivering an operating profit of $3.7 billion, driven by a 92% rise in realized export prices and a 6% increase in export volumes to 36.1 million tons. This was partially offset by the 15% strengthening of the rand against the U.S. dollar. And as expected, Sishen's rand unit cost increased 15%, driven by a 24% increase in waste stripping, partially offset by a 3% increase in mining productivity. Total production at Sishen increased by 5% to 41.3 million tons. The jig plant achieved 13.3 million tons of production for the year, 300,000 tons above the nameplate capacity. Improvement in global steel demand drove higher sales volumes and prices at Samancor, with operating profits up 167% to $382 million. 
Our Met Coal business had a good year with operating profit of $783 million. We've been able to optimize our product mix with a higher proportion to our other sales coming from the premium pricing, hard coking met coal. We achieved record-export met coal sales, up an impressive 30%. The Queensland coal industry has experienced a period of record cycle and events and floods, which have impacted both our open cut, as well as underground operations. But despite this unprecedented disruption, our Met Coal business delivered record total production and record Met Coal production is up 16% on the prior year, and this translated into record sales up 30% on the prior year.
All our mines have now resumed normal operations, and we will ramp up the planned production in the second half as a result of early mitigation actions taken. Looking at the future growth prospects. Feasibility continues for our Grosvenor project with approval expected over the next 12 to 18 months, and this is forecast to produce 4.3 million tons per annum of premium hard coking coal. 
Turning to Thermal Coal. Our performance in South Africa and Colombia was broadly in line with 2009. We saw a strong recovery in thermal coal prices and increased export volumes from South Africa, offset by a strong rand. Production in South Africa was at a similar level to last year with Mafube ramping up to full production, offsetting a decline in volumes at our older mines. Zibulo is close to completion and well on its way to commercial production levels, and Cerrejon delivered a strong operational performance, maintaining production, unit cost and profit levels in spite of significant ramps in the second half.
And finally, turning to Diamonds. The business had a very, very impressive performance, the highest EBITDA in 10 years with sales up 57%. There was a strong recovery in demand and in prices for both rough and polished diamonds. And we're seeing increased purchasing in retail markets in China and India, and rough diamond prices ended the year close to where they were before the economic crisis. I'm pleased to say the work that we did on cost base containment has really paid off. We maintained the lower cost base approximately $500 million lower than 2008 despite bringing back online significant production. 
Now Rene will take us through the financials."

[indis",1063,"Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, another also very strong operational performance. [indiscernible] just below 30%. We got the benefit of the higher contribution from both De Beers and Kumba, which have a lower tax rate, more than offsetting the higher tax rate in Chile. For 2011, we are predicting the tax rate around 32%.
CapEx of $5 billion, lower than the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year due to the delay of securing the license in Brazil for the Minas Rio project. Net debt down to $7.4 billion. The strong cash flow generation, but also the progress on the divestment of the non-core asset, which are highlighted on the next slide. Total divestment and also $3.3 billion for 2008. We completed a $2.8 billion by the end of 2008 net obtained, and we have received $0.5 billion since the beginning of the year. We'd like also to highlight that this divestment we structured in a very tax-effective way with limited capital gain tax of $100 million.
We announced further stay in our restructuring program this morning with a combination of Tarmac U.K. asset with Lafarge U.K. asset in a 50-50. John mentioned, that will enable us to be in a much stronger position through this very challenging U.K. market. The two businesses are very complementary. Lafarge has a very strong position in cement, while Tarmac has a very strong position in aggregate asphalt and ready mix. We expect the combination to generate around $100 million of synergies over the two years following the completion of the collection, which we will present to you 30% at least in EBITDA compared to the pro forma EBITDA number for 2010.
Turning to the operating profit reconciliation, and you'll see on this slide how significant was the price variance in excess of $5.7 billion. I will go into more detail for each variances. I just want to highlight on this slide that the volume variance of $100 million is at last year's margin. If you are using the current year margin of 2010, it would be $250 million. We'd like also to highlight the increase in the contribution from associate of $718 million due to the increase in contribution from Samancor but also the recovery in other deals.
So turning first to the price variance for traded commodities. Copper, $1.2 billion price variance. That includes the benefits of the mark-to-market adjustments in 2010 of $195 million. At end of December 2010, we had 96,000 tons of copper provisioning price at $4.37.
Platinum, and if you look at the Platinum basket price, an increase of 39% from ZAR 14,000 to in excess of ZAR 18,000 in 2010. Currently, the platinum, that gets priced from ZAR 21,000.
Turning to bulk. And first, Iron Ore, as you know, the market moved to shorter-term pricing specifically, a quite early benchmark. In 2010, we sold 30% of our volume on our index base predominantly to Chinese customer. That's probably above what we would expect. We would expect on average to sell 80% of our volume on the benchmark basis and 20% on the spot basis.
Turning to bulk. Similar evolution for the metallurgical coal market. For Thermal Coal, in 2010, we still had a five-year contract, which had been priced on a fixed-priced basis. As you can see 40% of the sales at $67 return. That was the last year of this five-year contract, and in 2011, all the sales will be on the index basis.
Turning to exchange and volume variance. Negative FX variance of $1 billion, $700 million due to the strengthening of the rand and $300 million due to [indiscernible] dollar. In terms of volume variance, just want to highlight first the decline at copper of 7%. As Cynthia mentioned, due to strikes at Collahuasi, and as expected, lower grade at Los Bronces. In 2011, we will get the benefit of the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion, and we expect overall a 10% increase in copper production.
Metallurgical coal, quite a substantial increase in production, 60% all due to a productivity improvement at our long-haul operation in Australia at 14.7 million tons of metallurgical coal. In 2011, as a result of the flooding in Queensland, we expect a flat production around the same neighborhood of 14.7 million tons. In the case of Iron Ore, a 5% increase, and then despite the challenge and the problem we add with cost net, we add in the second half of 2010, five-day regimens in South Africa. And then you see the increase in production, a 34% increase in cap production for 2011 to be at 6.18 to be striking below 14 million carats. 
Turning to the cost side. Cash cost increase of 2.1%, all due to non-controllable cost at permanently fuel and electricity, electricity increased in both South Africa and Chile.
Turning to CapEx and net debt. As I mentioned on my first slide, total CapEx of $5 billion for the full year, $2.3 billion due to the aforementioned project. We expect a ramp-up in CapEx over the next two years now that we have secured the licenses at Minas Rio. CapEx for the next two years will be around $6.5 billion for both 2011 and 2012.
Turning to cash flow and net debt. Cash flow on the right-hand side, net debt down to $7.4 billion, and that includes the impact of recapitalizing both on the Platinum and De Beers. Cynthia highlighted the potential improvement at both Platinum and De Beers. I want also to highlight that both businesses are in a much stronger position for the balance sheet standpoint, although Platinum now has net debt of ZAR 4.1 billion, which has enabled our Platinum to resume its dividend, and De Beers had external net debt of $1.2 billion, and we expect it to start to repay shareholder load in 2011.
Net debt of $7.4 billion. That includes net cash position in South Africa of $1.8 billion and the net debt outside of South Africa of $8.2 billion. We have total debt of $15 billion at the end of December, which no financing maturing in 2011. So a very strong financial position, allowing us to pay slightly higher-than-expected final dividend. Thank you."

We see near-term organic growth of 50% by 2015, equating to 7% per year. We will start up a new mining operation every six to nine months over the next few years, and I will provide you detail where we are on the initial four in a moment. 
Over the next three years, we expect to approve projects with a total CapEx value of $16 billion. But let's look beyond the near term to our world-class resource base. As you can see, we have a very impressive growth portfolio, some 60 products spanning our core commodities, major geographies and through the development cycle. In addition to the already approved $17 billion of projects underway, our next wave of projects represents a potential investment of about $53 billion. And as I've already said, this gives us the potential to more than double our production over the next decade.
We're delivering on all our four key projects: Barro Alto nickel in Brazil is in the commissioning phase and on schedule for the first metal next month. This project makes use of a proven technology and will provide 41,000 tons per annum of nickel for the first five years at an average of 36,000 tons per annum over the life of mine with a competitive cost position, the lower half of the cost curve. Barro Alto has a life of mine in excess of 25 years from an extensive resource space, and it will more than double our production for our Nickel business.
Turning to our second project coming on stream this year. The Los Bronces expansion project in Chile is on track for the first production in the fourth quarter. With the expansion, production at Los Bronces is scheduled to increase to 490,000 tons per annum over the first three years of full production and will average 400,000 tons per annum over the first 10 years. At peak production levels, Los Bronces is expected to be the fifth largest-producing copper mining in the world. It has highly attractive cash operating cost, approximately $0.80 per pound and reserves and resources to support a mine life of over 30 years with further expansion potential. Within the Los Bronces area, we have completed 3.6 kilometers of the 8-kilometer exploration tunnel that will provide underground drilling access to explore and to fund the resources at the very sizable and high-quality new discovery at Los Sulfatos. The resource potential was 1.2 billion tons at 1.46% copper. 
In South Africa, we have the Kolomela iron ore project, which at the end of December was 81% complete. It is on track for a second quarter start-up in 2012. By the end of 2013, we expect to be producing 9 million tons of low-cost high-quality seaborne iron ore, and there's potential for further expansion. Once again, we're looking at a very attractive cost position in the lower half of the cost curve. 
And finally, to Minas Rio, our iron ore project in Brazil, scheduled to produce 26.5 million tons per annum in its first phase. We now have the main licenses that allow us to start the civil work for the beneficiation plant and tailings done next month. We expect it will take between 27 and 30 months from the start of these works to construct and commission the mine and plant, complete the project and deliver the first ore on shift. As you would expect, there are some other licenses and permits that we will need along the way, but the progress made in 2010 was very significant. 
In December, we announced that we agreed a fixed 25-year iron ore port tariff with our partner LLX. As part of the agreement to secure the long-term tariff arrangements, we will fund the greater share of the development cost of the first phase of the port. This agreement is expected to result in an additional capital expenditure attributable to us of about $525 million in relation to the port. The pipeline is progressing well. 87% land access has been secured, up from 54% in January.
Two underground river crossings have been completed, one, of which is the longest of its type in Brazil; and pipeline is ahead of schedule. Civil work for the filtration plant are underway and at the port. We've started building the iron ore pier and breakwater having completed the 2.9 kilometer long main bridge. Through our ongoing expansion settings, we have increased the total resource volume to 5.3 billion tons, which supports the expansion of project beyond 26.5 million tons. 
Beyond these four projects that are well underway, we are progressing towards approval decisions in relation to the development of two further high-quality growth projects: the 225,000 ton per annum Quellaveco copper project in Peru; and the 4.3 million ton per annum Grosvenor hard coking coal project in Australia. Again, like all our major projects, these are long life and low cost positioned to the lower half of the cost curve and with resource spaces that support long production lives.
Finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the macro economic outlook. At the time of our results last year, there was considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy. Some economists were worried about a potential double-dip in the U.S. and a sharp slowdown in China, but these fears proved unfounded. Over the last year, the world economy has grown more strongly than expected. Crucially, the U.S. economy has improved significantly, and in recent weeks, we've seen evidence of a market acceleration. Stronger consumer spending is supporting GDP growth, and the latest manufacturing ISM survey points to healthy growth early in 2011. With Chinese growth easing slightly, a stronger U.S. economy is vital to sustain in the global economic recovery and demand for our commodities over the next few years. 
As we've seen, there has been some volatility in the economies and commodities in the shorter term, and we expect this to continue. In the longer term, however, the fundamentals for the mining industry look very strong. China, India and other emerging economies are still in the early stages of their catch-up with the advanced economies. As the living standards improve, Asia's middle class will expand dramatically, generating significant gains into spreadable incomes and demand for more consumable durables.
In addition, there should be huge increases in spending on infrastructure to support the development of these economies. U.S. policymakers also recognize the need to step up infrastructure investment. In this environment, we expect continuing robust demand growth for all of our key commodities over the next two decades. The continued urbanization of China will drive demand for our core commodities such as finished steel. Steel consumption per capital has been rising dramatically in China over the last five to 10 years and has caught up with and recently overtaken the U.S. We expect per capita steel consumption in China to reach around 450 to 500 kilograms per capita as urbanization increases to 60% over the next nine to 10 years. In absolute terms, this represents a very significant increase in annual finished steel demand of an additional 250 million tons. And this is very good news for iron ore and metallurgical coal. 
Not only is China embedding a huge point of our core commodities in its infrastructure, there is significant amount of planned urban regeneration and renewal. The scope for growth in demand is significant, and it is perhaps the most surprise that we see the consumption of high value material such as stainless steel growing at a rapid rate. We believe that we have a good handle on China, and this supports our very constructive outlook for our core commodities.
In summary, the set of results reflects delivery on all fronts. We are achieving operational excellence. We are continuing to drive our businesses down and the cost curves. We have one of the most exciting growth profiles in the industry. We have strengthened our balance sheet. We are making excellent progress on our divestments, and we are very positive about the outlook for our core commodities. This shows that we are in a great position to achieve our ambition to becoming the leading global mining company. The investment, the partner and the employer of choice. Thank you very much, everybody, for your attention, and we'd now like to take questions. Thank you."

But clearly, as well, as you point out, we've got a significant growth pipeline. We will prioritize that growth pipeline as per the returns, timing, and it will be on that basis that we will determine the level of dividend going forward. Your second point of questioning is around Platinum. I think that Neville won't say it but I'll say it on behalf of the Platinum group. I think they've done an outstanding job. We've surpassed the target on productivity. We said we were going to reach seven square meters per employee. We've reached 7.06 square meters. We're looking at another 7.3 square meters this year and that productivity continuing to ramp up. This is the third year that they've delivered cost virtually flat year-on-year. And I think as I said earlier, given electricity prices increasing by 25%, 26%, given labor increases representing a very substantial part of the underlying cost in the neighborhood of 8%, 9%, it is challenging, but they've done an outstanding job.

I think it'll be good for the group to hear a little bit about the progress that we've made because it is quite impressive and will be very helpful, I think, to this audience. In terms of your question about productivity, it is quite impressive. We see productivity increases almost across the group starting first with what Seamus has done in Australia followed by what Neville is doing in Platinum. Chris is not here, but we've done phenomenally well in Kumba. So it's virtually across the group that we're seeing this kind of gain, and it really comes back to the approach that we're taking around asset optimization, our focus on the operation, every single one benefiting from the global expertise in group. And maybe I could just touch on the asset optimizations because that's really where it's being driven from. We delivered $3 billion of value this past year. And as I said, it's a year ahead of schedule. I have to tell you, frankly, I didn't think we would get to this level so fast. We're now looking at how we further capitalize on this, and I would have to say, and I don't want to give you too much food for thought here, but the further uplift to the group is quite sizable. How are we doing that? Well, in 2010, we performed five operational reviews in asset optimization, targeting and identifying specific opportunities and capitalizing on our technical excellence. Although this is early days from those reviews, we identified about $170 million of value just in those few alone. We're looking to further standardize and implement the measures that we're putting in place and really work our way up the maturity curve to excellence across the group through asset optimization. And I think in procurement as well, we're also I just should mention that because I think the value there has been fantastic, and we see a lot more to come. So again, not to oversell the progress that we're making here, but I think it is evidence of the ability to deliver and the focus that everybody has on their operations, and moving into a very competitive cost position. And I think the embedded value in the company, in the organization across the board continues to be quite high.

With the mining permit that we've got in August last year and with the installation license for the beneficiation plant, the tailings dam we're doing in December, we are on track now up to start the civil works. We have about 40% of the Earthworks completed at the beneficiation plant. We're going to start civils now in March. So this is all according to our schedule, and we are slightly, I would say, ahead of the game in that site. In the pipeline, we have about 87% of the landowners secured. If you look at the state of Rio, where the pipeline is starting, so the pipeline is coming up from the port to the mine. We have about 97% almost finished of the Earthworks done. About end of January, 100 kilometers of pipe welded and installed. So about 20% of the whole pipeline is already finished. We at the port the last bit, at the port, we are about two and half months ahead of schedule. We have the bridge ready, the pier is just over half of it done, started the breakwater.

I'd like to start by giving you the highlights of what has been a very strong year on all fronts. Then also give you some detail on the operational performance of our businesses. Rene will then take you through the financials, and we'll conclude with an update of our major growth projects and a view on the growth that is coming up over the next decade. 
So the highlights. We have had a very strong set of numbers to report. Group operating profit for the year was $9.8 billion, almost double that of the previous year. Underlying earnings were $5 billion and EPS was $4.13, a 93% increase on 2009. Our asset optimization and procurement programs have exceeded all expectations. They have delivered $3 billion very considerably ahead of our target and a year ahead of schedule. And I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on the divestments of our non-core assets with proceeds received so far of $3.3 billion. There's been further headway made today with the announcements that Tarmac Limited and Lafarge U.K. have agreed to combine to create a leading U.K. construction materials company. 
We have an exceptionally strong organic growth outlook both in the immediate term and coming years. In the near term, we will deliver 50% volume growth to 2015 starting with Barro Alto next month. We have a $70 billion project pipeline, and in the next three years alone, we expect to approve a further $16 billion in project CapEx.
And as John, our Chairman, indicated, we're pleased to announce the final dividend will be $0.40, bringing total dividend for the year to $0.65 per share. 
Before we turn to the operating performance for the year, I want to look at safety, and that's because it is a priority for me. Our employees have a right to go home safely at the end of every day. 90% of our sites operated without fatalities during 2010, and we put a lot of hard work into this, and we've seen the number of fatalities decline by 68% in the last four years. In the same period, we've seen 51% improvement in lost time injury rates, but having said that, we lost 14 colleagues on company business in 2010. And this is unacceptable and a strong reminder of the work we still have to do on safety. I am passionately committed to zero harm, and I won't settle for anything less.
We're headed in the right direction. Our people do understand what we mean when we talk about safety, and so do the governments and the trade unions. Improving safety is not only the right thing to do, it is at the core of the Anglo American values. And it raises morale. It furthers our relationships with our partners. And helps us enormously in the steps we are taking to improve things like productivity.
When we look at how Anglo American has performed, I believe the recovery in our performance reflects the decisive action we took during the worst of the downturn. The decisions we took then to cut cost, to restructure the group, to raise productivity and crucially to maintain investment in our key growth projects without turning to the market for additional capital, these were the right decisions. I'm pleased to say that we are now leveraging the benefits of that discipline. 
To give you some examples. In Metallurgical Coal, we have transformed our productivity performance. Our focus on structure and asset optimization programs has yielded significant benefits with labor productivity at our export mines some 48% above 2008 levels. Long-haul performance at our premier hard coking coal sites, Moranbah and Capcoal, had been a particular focus. We have embedded new long-haul management processes at these sites, which have driven a 50% improvement in long-haul move times and a 23% increase in underground production. As a result of these initiatives, our coking coal production is now almost entirely positioned in the lower half of the industry cost curve. 
In Platinum too, we have continued to make excellent progress in improving our cost position, with a majority of our production now in the lower half of the cost curve. We have increased productivity by 23% since 2008 and exceeded our target of seven square meters per operating employee in 2010. In a business where approximately half of the cost base is labor-related, the strong productivity performance has been fundamental to delivering our production target, while keeping cash operating cost below inflation.
At the beginning of 2009, we set a $2 billion Asset Optimisation and Procurement target to be delivered by the end of 2011. In July last year, we increased that target by applying it just to the core operations. As you can see today, not only have we substantially surpassed that target, we've done so a full year early. This performance has been achieved throughout the group with every business unit delivering a substantial gain through applying the rigorous disciplines of our AO and Procurement programs. And I'm confident that we're going to unlock further value from Asset Optimisation in particular as we continue to embed and sustain best-in-class practices across all of our businesses. 
What we have here is a snapshot of our clear position as a world-class mining company. We have a well-diversified portfolio and structurally attractive commodities, on which we decided to concentrate. Our commodities are copper, diamonds, iron ore, manganese, met coal, nickel, platinum and thermal coal. They will deliver long term through the cycle returns and have strong fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles.
We have strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from non-core disposals of $3.3 billion. We have our commodity business units positioned where we want them, driving value and moving further down the cost curve and a world-class project pipeline. 
Let me now put those achievements in the context of our strategic path. We've delivered the cost management and improved productivity mindsets I've talked about. The stronger balance sheet, the good progress on our divestments of non-core assets. We're delivering our near-term growth that I shall cover in some detail in a few minutes. I'm looking beyond the next wave of project growth. We have a broad ranging project pipeline with potential to double production over the next decade. These are resources that we already own that our tactical and exploration teams continue to identify, to refine and to advance. And together, they provide us with tremendous growth optionality for the long term.
Let's start with Copper now turning to our business units. Our operating profit is up 40% to $2.8 billion, reflecting record average copper prices for the year peaking at $4.42 per pound. In line with our expectations, our production was marginally down as a result of the planned lower copper grades at Los Bronces and Collahuasi. And we also saw two separate strikes at Collahuasi during the year. Our low-cost, long-life brownfield expansion project at Los Bronces is on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter of this year, adding an additional 278,000 tons per annum over the first three years, more than a 40% increase in our attributable copper production. 
In Nickel, the division contributed just under $100 million in the year, driven by strong prices and an increase in production. The world-class Barro Alto project is on schedule for the first metal at the end of next month, and at full capacity, this will double our current nickel production.
Our Platinum business generate $837 million of operating profit. Production was better than expectations with refined platinum production of 2.57 million ounces, up over 118,000 ounces or 5%, with the strong performance from our own mine operations. Cost inflation will, however, continue to present the business with challenges this year. Mining inflation remained well above South African CPI during 2010, and this differential is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. This year, we will see another 25% increase in electricity tariffs, and there are further waste negotiations starting in the first half of this year and coming into effect on the 1st of July. Continued aggressive cost management and increased labor productivity enabled the business to keep cash operating cost increases below prevailing inflation, and that is the approach that we intend to apply going forward.
Turning to Iron Ore. Kumba reported a record financial performance, delivering an operating profit of $3.7 billion, driven by a 92% rise in realized export prices and a 6% increase in export volumes to 36.1 million tons. This was partially offset by the 15% strengthening of the rand against the U.S. dollar. And as expected, Sishen's rand unit cost increased 15%, driven by a 24% increase in waste stripping, partially offset by a 3% increase in mining productivity. Total production at Sishen increased by 5% to 41.3 million tons. The jig plant achieved 13.3 million tons of production for the year, 300,000 tons above the nameplate capacity. Improvement in global steel demand drove higher sales volumes in prices at Samancor, with operating profits up 167% to $382 million. 
Our Met Coal business had a good year with operating profit of $783 million. We've been able to optimize our product mix with a higher proportion to our other sales coming from the premium pricing, hard coking met coal. We achieved record-export met coal sales, up an impressive 30%. The Queensland coal industry has experienced a period of record cycle and events and floods, which have impacted both our open cut, as well as underground operations. But despite this unprecedented disruption, our Met Coal business delivered record total production and record Met Coal production is up 16% on the prior year, and this translated into record sales up 30% on the prior year.
All our mines have now resumed normal operations, and we will ramp up the planned production in the second half as a result of early mitigation actions taken. Looking at the future growth prospects. Feasibility continues for our Grosvenor project with approval expected over the next 12 to 18 months, and this is forecast to produce 4.3 million tons per annum of premium hard coking coal. 
Turning to Thermal Coal. Our performance in South Africa and Colombia was broadly in line with 2009. We saw a strong recovery in thermal coal prices and increased export volumes from South Africa, offset by a strong rand. Production in South Africa was at a similar level to last year with Mafube ramping up to full production, offsetting a decline in volumes at our older mines. Zibulo is close to completion and well on its way to commercial production levels, and Cerrejon delivered a strong operational performance, maintaining production, unit cost and profit levels in spite of significant ramps in the second half.
And finally, turning to Diamonds. The business had a very, very impressive performance, the highest EBITDA in 10 years with sales up 57%. There was a strong recovery in demand and in prices for both rough and polished diamonds. And we're seeing increased purchasing in retail markets in China and India, and rough diamond prices ended the year close to where they were before the economic crisis. I'm pleased to say the work that we did on cost base containment has really paid off. We maintained the lower cost base approximately $500 million lower than 2008 despite bringing back online significant production. 
Now Rene will take us through the financials."

A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, another also very strong operational performance. [indis",1067,"Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, another also very strong operational performance. [indiscernible] just below 30%. We got the benefit of the higher contribution from both De Beers and Kumba, which have a lower tax rate, more than offsetting the higher tax rate in Chile. For 2011, we are predicting the tax rate around 32%.
CapEx of $5 billion, lower than the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year due to the delay of securing the license in Brazil for the Minas Rio project. Net debt down to $7.4 billion. The strong cash flow generation, but also the progress on the divestment of the non-core asset, which are highlighted on the next slide. Total divestment and also $3.3 billion for 2008. We completed a $2.8 billion by the end of 2008 net obtained, and we have received $0.5 billion since the beginning of the year. We'd like also to highlight that this divestment we structured in a very tax-effective way with limited capital gain tax of $100 million.
We announced further stay in our restructuring program this morning with a combination of Tarmac U.K. asset with Lafarge U.K. asset in a 50-50. John mentioned, that will enable us to be in a much stronger position through this very challenging U.K. market. The two businesses are very complementary. Lafarge has a very strong position in cement, while Tarmac has a very strong position in aggregate asphalt and ready mix. We expect the combination to generate around $100 million of synergies over the two years following the completion of the collection, which we will present to you 30% at least in EBITDA compared to the pro forma EBITDA number for 2010.
Turning to the operating profit reconciliation, and you'll see on this slide how significant was the price variance in excess of $5.7 billion. I will go into more detail for each variances. I just want to highlight on this slide that the volume variance of $100 million is at last year's margin. If you are using the current year margin of 2010, it would be $250 million. We'd like also to highlight the increase in the contribution from associate of $718 million due to the increase in contribution from Samancor but also the recovery in other deals.
So turning first to the price variance for traded commodities. Copper, $1.2 billion price variance. That includes the benefits of the mark-to-market adjustments in 2010 of $195 million. At end of December 2010, we had 96,000 tons of copper provisioning price at $4.37.
Platinum, and if you look at the Platinum basket price, an increase of 39% from ZAR 14,000 to in excess of ZAR 18,000 in 2010. Currently, the platinum basket priced from ZAR 21,000.
Turning to bulk. And first, Iron Ore, as you know, the market moved to shorter-term pricing specifically, a quarterly benchmark. In 2010, we sold 30% of our volume on our index base predominantly to Chinese customer. That's probably above what we would expect. We would expect on average to sell 80% of our volume on the benchmark basis and 20% on the spot basis.
Turning to bulk. Similar evolution for the metallurgical coal market. For Thermal Coal, in 2010, we still had a five-year contract, which had been priced on a fixed-priced basis. As you can see 40% of the sales at $67 return. That was the last year of this five-year contract, and in 2011, all the sales will be on the index basis.
Turning to exchange and volume variance. Negative FX variance of $1 billion, $700 million due to the strengthening of the rand and $300 million due to [indiscernible] dollar. In terms of volume variance, just want to highlight first the decline at copper of 7%. As Cynthia mentioned, due to strikes at Collahuasi, and as expected, lower grade at Los Bronces. In 2011, we will get the benefit of the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion, and we expect overall a 10% increase in copper production.
Metallurgical coal, quite a substantial increase in production, 60% all due to a productivity improvement at our long-haul operation in Australia at 14.7 million tons of metallurgical coal. In 2011, as a result of the flooding in Queensland, we expect a flat production around the same neighborhood of 14.7 million tons. In the case of Iron Ore, a 5% increase, and then despite the challenge and the problem we add with cost net, we add in the second half of 2010, five-day regimens in South Africa. And then you see the increase in production at -- there is a 34% increase in cap production for 2011. We are predicting  this to be slightly below 14 million carats. 
Turning to the cost side. Cash cost increase of 2.1%, all due to non-controllable cost at permanently fuel and electricity. Electricity increased in both South Africa and Chile.
Turning to CapEx and net debt. As I mentioned on my first slide, total CapEx of $5 billion for the full year, $2.3 billion due to the aforementioned project. We expect a ramp-up in CapEx over the next two years now that we have secured the auto licenses at Minas Rio. CapEx for the next two years will be around $6.5 billion for both 2011 and 2012.
Turning to cash flow and net debt. Cash flow on the right-hand side, net debt down to $7.4 billion, and that includes the impact of recapitalizing both on the Platinum and De Beers. Cynthia highlighted the potential improvement at both Platinum and De Beers. I want also to highlight that both businesses are in a much stronger position from the balance sheet standpoint, although Platinum now has net debt of ZAR 4.1 billion, which has enabled our Platinum to resume its dividend, and De Beers had external net debt of $1.2 billion, and we expect De Beers to start to repay shareholder load in 2011.
Net debt of $7.4 billion. That includes net cash position in South Africa of $1.8 billion and the net debt outside of South Africa of $8.2 billion. We have total debt of $15 billion at the end of December, with no financing maturing in 2011. So a very strong financial position, allowing us to pay slightly higher-than-expected final dividend. Thank you."

We see near-term organic growth of 50% by 2015, equating to 7% per year. We will start up a new mining operation every six to nine months over the next few years, and I will provide you detail where we are on the initial four in a moment. 
Over the next three years, we expect to approve projects with a total CapEx value of $16 billion. But let's look beyond the near term to our world-class resource base. As you can see, we have a very impressive growth portfolio, some 60 products spanning our core commodities, major geographies and through the development cycle. In addition to the already approved $17 billion of projects underway, our next wave of projects represents a potential investment of about $53 billion. And as I've already said, this gives us the potential to more than double our production over the next decade.
We're delivering on all our four key projects: Barro Alto nickel in Brazil is in the commissioning phase and on schedule for the first metal next month. This project makes use of a proven technology and will provide 41,000 tons per annum of nickel for the first five years and an average of 36,000 tons per annum over the life of mine with a competitive cost position, the lower half of the cost curve. Barro Alto has a life of mine in excess of 25 years from an extensive resource base, and it will more than double our production for our Nickel business.
Turning to our second project coming on stream this year. The Los Bronces expansion project in Chile is on track for the first production in the fourth quarter. With the expansion, production at Los Bronces is scheduled to increase to 490,000 tons per annum over the first three years of full production and will average 400,000 tons per annum over the first 10 years. At peak production levels, Los Bronces is expected to be the fifth largest-producing copper mine in the world. It has highly attractive cash operating cost, approximately $0.80 per pound and reserves and resources to support a mine life of over 30 years with further expansion potential. Within the Los Bronces area, we have completed 3.6 kilometers of the 8-kilometer exploration tunnel that will provide underground drilling access to explore and to fund the resources at the very sizable and high-quality new discovery at Los Sulfatos. The resource potential was 1.2 billion tons at 1.46% copper. 
In South Africa, we have the Kolomela iron ore project, which at the end of December was 81% complete. It is on track for a second quarter start-up in 2012. By the end of 2013, we expect to be producing 9 million tons of low-cost, high-quality seaborne iron ore, and there's potential for further expansion. Once again, we're looking at a very attractive cost position in the lower half of the cost curve. 
And finally, to Minas Rio, our iron ore project in Brazil, scheduled to produce 26.5 million tons per annum in its first phase. We now have the main licenses that allow us to start the civil work for the beneficiation plant and tailing stand next month. We expect it will take between 27 and 30 months from the start of these works to construct and commission the mine and plant, complete the project and deliver the first ore on ship. As you would expect, there are some other licenses and permits that we will need along the way, but the progress made in 2010 was very significant. 
In December, we announced that we agreed a fixed 25-year iron ore port tariff with our partner LLX. As part of the agreement to secure the long-term tariff arrangements, we will fund the greater share of the development cost of the first phase of the port. This agreement is expected to result in an additional capital expenditure attributable to us of about $525 million in relation to the port. The pipeline is progressing well. 87% land access has been secured, up from 54% in January.
Two underground river crossings have been completed, one, of which is the longest of its type in Brazil; and pipeline is ahead of schedule. Civil work for the filtration plant are underway and at the ports. We've started building the iron ore pier and breakwater having completed the 2.9 kilometer long main bridge. Through our ongoing expansion studies, we have increased the total resource volume to 5.3 billion tons, which supports the expansion of project beyond 26.5 million tons. 
Beyond these four projects that are well underway, we are progressing towards approval decisions in relation to the development of two further high-quality growth projects: the 225,000 ton per annum Quellaveco copper project in Peru; and the 4.3 million ton per annum Grosvenor hard coking coal project in Australia. Again, like all our major projects, these are long life and low cost positioned in the lower half of the cost curve and with resource basis that support long production lives.
Finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the macro economic outlook. At the time of our results last year, there was considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy. Some economists were worried about a potential double-dip in the U.S. and a sharp slowdown in China, but these fears proved unfounded. Over the last year, the world economy has grown more strongly than expected. Crucially, the U.S. economy has improved significantly, and in recent weeks, we've seen evidence of a market acceleration. Stronger consumer spending is supporting GDP growth, and the latest manufacturing ISM survey points to healthy growth early in 2011. With Chinese growth easing slightly, a stronger U.S. economy is vital to sustaining the global economic recovery and demand for our commodities over the next few years. 
As we've seen, there has been some volatility in the economies and in commodities in the shorter term, and we expect this to continue. In the longer term, however, the fundamentals for the mining industry look very strong. China, India and other emerging economies are still in the early stages of their catch-up with the advanced economies. As the living standards improve, Asia's middle class will expand dramatically, generating significant gains into spreadable incomes and demand for more consumable durables.
In addition, there should be huge increases in spending on infrastructure to support the development of these economies. U.S. policymakers also recognize the need to step up infrastructure investment. In this environment, we expect continuing robust demand growth for all of our key commodities over the next two decades. The continued urbanization of China will drive demand for our core commodities such as finished steel. Steel consumption per capita has been rising dramatically in China over the last five to 10 years and has caught up with and recently overtaken the U.S. We expect per capita steel consumption in China to reach around 450 to 500 kilograms per capita as urbanization increases to 60% over the next nine to 10 years. In absolute terms, this represents a very significant increase in annual finished steel demand of an additional 250 million tons. And this is very good news for iron ore and metallurgical coal. 
Not only is China embedding a huge quantity of our core commodities in its infrastructure, there is significant amount of planned urban regeneration and renewal. The scope for growth in demand is significant, and it is perhaps the most surprise that we see the consumption of high value material such as stainless steel growing at a rapid rate. We believe that we have a good handle on China, and this supports a very constructive outlook for our core commodities.
In summary, the set of results reflects delivery on all fronts. We are achieving operational excellence. We are continuing to drive our businesses down and the cost curves. We have one of the most exciting growth profiles in the industry. We have strengthened our balance sheet. We are making excellent progress on our divestments, and we are very positive about the outlook for our core commodities. This shows that we are in a great position to achieve our ambition to becoming the leading global mining company. The investment, the partner and the employer of choice. Thank you very much, everybody, for your attention, and we'd now like to take questions. Thank you."

But clearly, as well, as you point out, we've got a significant growth pipeline. We will prioritize that growth pipeline as per the returns, timing, and it will be on that basis that we will determine the level of dividend going forward. Your second point of questioning is around Platinum. I think that Neville won't say it but I'll say it on behalf of the Platinum group. I think they've done an outstanding job. We've surpassed the target on productivity. We said we were going to reach seven square meters per employee. We've reached 7.06 square meters. We're looking at another 7.3 square meters this year and that productivity continuing to ramp up. This is the third year that they've delivered cost virtually flat year-on-year. And I think as I said earlier, given electricity prices increasing by 25%, 26%, given labor increases representing a very substantial part of the underlying cost in the neighborhood of 8%, 9%, it is challenging, but they've done an outstanding job.

I think it'll be good for the group to hear a little bit about the progress that we've made because it is quite impressive and will be very helpful, I think, to this audience. In terms of your question about productivity, it is quite impressive. We see productivity increases almost across the group starting first with what Seamus has done in Australia followed by what Neville is doing in Platinum. Chris is not here, but we've done phenomenally well in Kumba. So it's virtually across the group that we're seeing this kind of gain, and it really comes back to the approach that we're taking around asset optimization, our focus on the operation, every single one benefiting from the global expertise in group. And maybe I could just touch on the asset optimizations because that's really where it's being driven from. We delivered $3 billion of value this past year. And as I said, it's a year ahead of schedule. I have to tell you, frankly, I didn't think we would get to this level so fast. We're now looking at how we further capitalize on this, and I would have to say, and I don't want to give you too much food for thought here, but the further uplift to the group is quite sizable. How are we doing that? Well, in 2010, we performed five operational reviews in asset optimization, targeting and identifying specific opportunities and capitalizing on our technical excellence. Although this is early days from those reviews, we identified about $170 million of value just in those few alone. We're looking to further standardize and implement the measures that we're putting in place and really work our way up the maturity curve to excellence across the group through asset optimization. And I think in procurement as well, we're also I just should mention that because I think the value there has been fantastic, and we see a lot more to come. So again, not to oversell the progress that we're making here, but I think it is evidence of the ability to deliver and the focus that everybody has on their operations, and moving into a very competitive cost position. And I think the embedded value in the company, in the organization across the board continues to be quite high.

With the mining permit that we've got in August last year and with the installation license for the beneficiation plant, the tailings dam we're doing in December, we are on track now up to start the civil works. We have about 40% of the Earthworks completed at the beneficiation plant. We're going to start civils now in March. So this is all according to our schedule, and we are slightly, I would say, ahead of the game in that site. In the pipeline, we have about 87% of the landowners secured. If you look at the state of Rio, where the pipeline is starting, so the pipeline is coming up from the port to the mine. We have about 97% almost finished of the Earthworks done. About end of January, 100 kilometers of pipe welded and installed. So about 20% of the whole pipeline is already finished.

If that was transferred across to Cadelco, it's exercisable for a period of 30 days, January. The next one comes up in January 2012. I think it's a broad comment. The option has not been in the money any time in the last 30 years, and I don't think there's any reason why we would expect that to change. The formula that it's based upon is reasonably complex and is fairly confidential. That is based upon, amongst other things, the previous five years of earnings. And obviously, the high prices that we've had in copper over the past five years further push up their price of exercising that option."

I'd like to start by giving you the highlights of what has been a very strong year on all fronts. Then also give you some detail on the operational performance of our businesses. Rene will then take you through the financials, and we'll conclude with an update of our major growth projects and a view on the growth that is coming up over the next decade. 
So the highlights. We have had a very strong set of numbers to report. Group operating profit for the year was $9.8 billion, almost double that of the previous year. Underlying earnings were $5 billion and EPS was $4.13, a 93% increase on 2009. Our asset optimization and procurement programs have exceeded all expectations. They have delivered $3 billion very considerably ahead of our target and a year ahead of schedule. And I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on the divestments of our non-core assets with proceeds received so far of $3.3 billion. There's been further headway made today with the announcements that Tarmac Limited and Lafarge U.K. have agreed to combine to create a leading U.K. construction materials company. 
We have an exceptionally strong organic growth outlook both in the immediate term and coming years. In the near term, we will deliver 50% volume growth to 2015 starting with Barro Alto next month. We have a $70 billion project pipeline, and in the next three years alone, we expect to approve a further $16 billion in project CapEx.
And as John, our Chairman, indicated, we're pleased to announce the final dividend will be $0.40, bringing total dividend for the year to $0.65 per share. 
Before we turn to the operating performance for the year, I want to look at safety, and that's because it is a priority for me. Our employees have a right to go home safely at the end of every day. 90% of our sites operated without fatalities during 2010, and we put a lot of hard work into this, and we've seen the number of fatalities decline by 68% in the last four years. In the same period, we've seen 51% improvement in lost time injury rates, but having said that, we lost 14 colleagues on company business in 2010. And this is unacceptable and a strong reminder of the work we still have to do on safety. I am passionately committed to zero harm, and I won't settle for anything less.
We're headed in the right direction. Our people do understand what we mean when we talk about safety, and so do the governments and the trade unions. Improving safety is not only the right thing to do, it is at the core of the Anglo American values. And it raises morale. It furthers our relationships with our partners. And helps us enormously in the steps we are taking to improve things like productivity.
When we look at how Anglo American has performed, I believe the recovery in our performance reflects the decisive action we took during the worst of the downturn. The decisions we took then to cut cost, to restructure the group, to raise productivity and crucially to maintain investment in our key growth projects without turning to the market for additional capital, these were the right decisions. I'm pleased to say that we are now leveraging the benefits of that discipline. 
To give you some examples. In Metallurgical Coal, we have transformed our productivity performance. Our focus on structure and asset optimization programs has yielded significant benefits with labor productivity at our export mines some 48% above 2008 levels. Long-haul performance at our premier hard coking coal sites, Moranbah and Capcoal, had been a particular focus. We have embedded new long-haul management processes at these sites, which have driven a 50% improvement in long-haul move times and a 23% increase in underground production. As a result of these initiatives, our coking coal production is now almost entirely positioned in the lower half of the industry cost curve. 
In Platinum too, we have continued to make excellent progress in improving our cost position, with a majority of our production now in the lower half of the cost curve. We have increased productivity by 23% since 2008 and exceeded our target of seven square meters per operating employee in 2010. In a business where approximately half of the cost base is labor-related, the strong productivity performance has been fundamental to delivering our production target, while keeping cash operating cost below inflation.
At the beginning of 2009, we set a $2 billion Asset Optimisation and Procurement target to be delivered by the end of 2011. In July last year, we increased that target by applying it just to the core operations. As you can see today, not only have we substantially surpassed that target, we've done so a full year early. This performance has been achieved throughout the group with every business unit delivering a substantial gain through applying the rigorous disciplines of our AO and Procurement programs. And I'm confident that we're going to unlock further value from Asset Optimisation in particular as we continue to embed and sustain best-in-class practices across all of our businesses. 
What we have here is a snapshot of our clear position as a world-class mining company. We have a well-diversified portfolio and structurally attractive commodities, on which we decided to concentrate. Our commodities are copper, diamonds, iron ore, manganese, met coal, nickel, platinum and thermal coal. They will deliver long term through the cycle returns and have strong fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles.
We have strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from non-core disposals of $3.3 billion. We have our commodity business units positioned where we want them, driving value and moving further down the cost curve and a world-class project pipeline. 
Let me now put those achievements in the context of our strategic path. We've delivered the cost management and improved productivity mindsets I've talked about. The stronger balance sheet, the good progress on our divestments of non-core assets. We're delivering our near-term growth that I shall cover in some detail in a few minutes. I'm looking beyond the next wave of project growth. We have a broad ranging project pipeline with potential to double production over the next decade. These are resources that we already own that our tactical and exploration teams continue to identify, to refine and to advance. And together, they provide us with tremendous growth optionality for the long term.
Let's start with Copper now turning to our business units. Our operating profit is up 40% to $2.8 billion, reflecting record average copper prices for the year peaking at $4.42 per pound. In line with our expectations, our production was marginally down as a result of the planned lower copper grades at Los Bronces and Collahuasi. And we also saw two separate strikes at Collahuasi during the year. Our low-cost, long-life brownfield expansion project at Los Bronces is on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter of this year, adding an additional 278,000 tons per annum over the first three years, more than a 40% increase in our attributable copper production. 
In Nickel, the division contributed just under $100 million in the year, driven by strong prices and an increase in production. The world-class Barro Alto project is on schedule for the first metal at the end of next month, and at full capacity, this will double our current nickel production.
Our Platinum business generate $837 million of operating profit. Production was better than expectations with refined platinum production of 2.57 million ounces, up over 118,000 ounces or 5%, with the strong performance from our own mine operations. Cost inflation will, however, continue to present the business with challenges this year. Mining inflation remained well above South African CPI during 2010, and this differential is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. This year, we will see another 25% increase in electricity tariffs, and there are further waste negotiations starting in the first half of this year and coming into effect on the 1st of July. Continued aggressive cost management and increased labor productivity enabled the business to keep cash operating cost increases below prevailing inflation, and that is the approach that we intend to apply going forward.
Turning to Iron Ore. Kumba reported a record financial performance, delivering an operating profit of $3.7 billion, driven by a 92% rise in realized export prices and a 6% increase in export volumes to 36.1 million tons. This was partially offset by the 15% strengthening of the rand against the U.S. dollar. And as expected, Sishen's rand unit cost increased 15%, driven by a 24% increase in waste stripping, partially offset by a 3% increase in mining productivity. Total production at Sishen increased by 5% to 41.3 million tons. The jig plant achieved 13.3 million tons of production for the year, 300,000 tons above the nameplate capacity. Improvement in global steel demand drove higher sales volumes in prices at Samancor, with operating profits up 167% to $382 million. 
Our Met Coal business had a good year with operating profit of $783 million. We've been able to optimize our product mix with a higher proportion to our other sales coming from the premium pricing, hard coking met coal. We achieved record-export met coal sales, up an impressive 30%. The Queensland coal industry has experienced a period of record cycle and events and floods, which have impacted both our open cut, as well as underground operations. But despite this unprecedented disruption, our Met Coal business delivered record total production and record Met Coal production is up 16% on the prior year, and this translated into record sales up 30% on the prior year.
All our mines have now resumed normal operations, and we will ramp up the planned production in the second half as a result of early mitigation actions taken. Looking at the future growth prospects. Feasibility continues for our Grosvenor project with approval expected over the next 12 to 18 months, and this is forecast to produce 4.3 million tons per annum of premium hard coking coal. 
Turning to Thermal Coal. Our performance in South Africa and Colombia was broadly in line with 2009. We saw a strong recovery in thermal coal prices and increased export volumes from South Africa, offset by a strong rand. Production in South Africa was at a similar level to last year with Mafube ramping up to full production, offsetting a decline in volumes at our older mines. Zibulo is close to completion and well on its way to commercial production levels, and Cerrejon delivered a strong operational performance, maintaining production, unit cost and profit levels in spite of significant ramps in the second half.
And finally, turning to Diamonds. The business had a very, very impressive performance, the highest EBITDA in 10 years with sales up 57%. There was a strong recovery in demand and in prices for both rough and polished diamonds. And we're seeing increased purchasing in retail markets in China and India, and rough diamond prices ended the year close to where they were before the economic crisis. I'm pleased to say the work that we did on cost base containment has really paid off. We maintained the lower cost base approximately $500 million lower than 2008 despite bringing back online significant production. 
Now Rene will take us through the financials."

A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, another also very strong operational performance. [indis",1067,"Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. A very strong financial performance. As Cynthia highlighted, we doubled our level of operating profit and earnings. On the back of favorable pricing, another also very strong operational performance. [indiscernible] just below 30%. We got the benefit of the higher contribution from both De Beers and Kumba, which have a lower tax rate, more than offsetting the higher tax rate in Chile. For 2011, we are predicting the tax rate around 32%.
CapEx of $5 billion, lower than the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year due to the delay of securing the license in Brazil for the Minas Rio project. Net debt down to $7.4 billion. The strong cash flow generation, but also the progress on the divestment of the non-core asset, which are highlighted on the next slide. Total divestment and also $3.3 billion for 2008. We completed a $2.8 billion by the end of 2008 net obtained, and we have received $0.5 billion since the beginning of the year. We'd like also to highlight that this divestment we structured in a very tax-effective way with limited capital gain tax of $100 million.
We announced further stay in our restructuring program this morning with a combination of Tarmac U.K. asset with Lafarge U.K. asset in a 50-50. John mentioned, that will enable us to be in a much stronger position through this very challenging U.K. market. The two businesses are very complementary. Lafarge has a very strong position in cement, while Tarmac has a very strong position in aggregate asphalt and ready mix. We expect the combination to generate around $100 million of synergies over the two years following the completion of the collection, which we will present to you 30% at least in EBITDA compared to the pro forma EBITDA number for 2010.
Turning to the operating profit reconciliation, and you'll see on this slide how significant was the price variance in excess of $5.7 billion. I will go into more detail for each variances. I just want to highlight on this slide that the volume variance of $100 million is at last year's margin. If you are using the current year margin of 2010, it would be $250 million. We'd like also to highlight the increase in the contribution from associate of $718 million due to the increase in contribution from Samancor but also the recovery in other deals.
So turning first to the price variance for traded commodities. Copper, $1.2 billion price variance. That includes the benefits of the mark-to-market adjustments in 2010 of $195 million. At end of December 2010, we had 96,000 tons of copper provisioning price at $4.37.
Platinum, and if you look at the Platinum basket price, an increase of 39% from ZAR 14,000 to in excess of ZAR 18,000 in 2010. Currently, the platinum basket priced from ZAR 21,000.
Turning to bulk. And first, Iron Ore, as you know, the market moved to shorter-term pricing specifically, a quarterly benchmark. In 2010, we sold 30% of our volume on our index base predominantly to Chinese customer. That's probably above what we would expect. We would expect on average to sell 80% of our volume on the benchmark basis and 20% on the spot basis.
Turning to bulk. Similar evolution for the metallurgical coal market. For Thermal Coal, in 2010, we still had a five-year contract, which had been priced on a fixed-priced basis. As you can see 40% of the sales at $67 return. That was the last year of this five-year contract, and in 2011, all the sales will be on the index basis.
Turning to exchange and volume variance. Negative FX variance of $1 billion, $700 million due to the strengthening of the rand and $300 million due to [indiscernible] dollar. In terms of volume variance, just want to highlight first the decline at copper of 7%. As Cynthia mentioned, due to strikes at Collahuasi, and as expected, lower grade at Los Bronces. In 2011, we will get the benefit of the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion, and we expect overall a 10% increase in copper production.
Metallurgical coal, quite a substantial increase in production, 60% all due to a productivity improvement at our long-haul operation in Australia at 14.7 million tons of metallurgical coal. In 2011, as a result of the flooding in Queensland, we expect a flat production around the same neighborhood of 14.7 million tons. In the case of Iron Ore, a 5% increase, and then despite the challenge and the problem we add with cost net, we add in the second half of 2010, five-day regimens in South Africa. And then you see the increase in production at -- there is a 34% increase in cap production for 2011. We are predicting  this to be slightly below 14 million carats. 
Turning to the cost side. Cash cost increase of 2.1%, all due to non-controllable cost at permanently fuel and electricity. Electricity increased in both South Africa and Chile.
Turning to CapEx and net debt. As I mentioned on my first slide, total CapEx of $5 billion for the full year, $2.3 billion due to the aforementioned project. We expect a ramp-up in CapEx over the next two years now that we have secured the auto licenses at Minas Rio. CapEx for the next two years will be around $6.5 billion for both 2011 and 2012.
Turning to cash flow and net debt. Cash flow on the right-hand side, net debt down to $7.4 billion, and that includes the impact of recapitalizing both on the Platinum and De Beers. Cynthia highlighted the potential improvement at both Platinum and De Beers. I want also to highlight that both businesses are in a much stronger position from the balance sheet standpoint, although Platinum now has net debt of ZAR 4.1 billion, which has enabled our Platinum to resume its dividend, and De Beers had external net debt of $1.2 billion, and we expect De Beers to start to repay shareholder load in 2011.
Net debt of $7.4 billion. That includes net cash position in South Africa of $1.8 billion and the net debt outside of South Africa of $8.2 billion. We have total debt of $15 billion at the end of December, with no financing maturing in 2011. So a very strong financial position, allowing us to pay slightly higher-than-expected final dividend. Thank you."

We see near-term organic growth of 50% by 2015, equating to 7% per year. We will start up a new mining operation every six to nine months over the next few years, and I will provide you detail where we are on the initial four in a moment. 
Over the next three years, we expect to approve projects with a total CapEx value of $16 billion. But let's look beyond the near term to our world-class resource base. As you can see, we have a very impressive growth portfolio, some 60 products spanning our core commodities, major geographies and through the development cycle. In addition to the already approved $17 billion of projects underway, our next wave of projects represents a potential investment of about $53 billion. And as I've already said, this gives us the potential to more than double our production over the next decade.
We're delivering on all our four key projects: Barro Alto nickel in Brazil is in the commissioning phase and on schedule for the first metal next month. This project makes use of a proven technology and will provide 41,000 tons per annum of nickel for the first five years and an average of 36,000 tons per annum over the life of mine with a competitive cost position, the lower half of the cost curve. Barro Alto has a life of mine in excess of 25 years from an extensive resource base, and it will more than double our production for our Nickel business.
Turning to our second project coming on stream this year. The Los Bronces expansion project in Chile is on track for the first production in the fourth quarter. With the expansion, production at Los Bronces is scheduled to increase to 490,000 tons per annum over the first three years of full production and will average 400,000 tons per annum over the first 10 years. At peak production levels, Los Bronces is expected to be the fifth largest-producing copper mine in the world. It has highly attractive cash operating cost, approximately $0.80 per pound and reserves and resources to support a mine life of over 30 years with further expansion potential. Within the Los Bronces area, we have completed 3.6 kilometers of the 8-kilometer exploration tunnel that will provide underground drilling access to explore and to fund the resources at the very sizable and high-quality new discovery at Los Sulfatos. The resource potential was 1.2 billion tons at 1.46% copper. 
In South Africa, we have the Kolomela iron ore project, which at the end of December was 81% complete. It is on track for a second quarter start-up in 2012. By the end of 2013, we expect to be producing 9 million tons of low-cost, high-quality seaborne iron ore, and there's potential for further expansion. Once again, we're looking at a very attractive cost position in the lower half of the cost curve. 
And finally, to Minas Rio, our iron ore project in Brazil, scheduled to produce 26.5 million tons per annum in its first phase. We now have the main licenses that allow us to start the civil work for the beneficiation plant and tailings dam next month. We expect it will take between 27 and 30 months from the start of these works to construct and commission the mine and plant, complete the project and deliver the first ore on ship. As you would expect, there are some other licenses and permits that we will need along the way, but the progress made in 2010 was very significant. 
In December, we announced that we agreed a fixed 25-year iron ore port tariff with our partner LLX. As part of the agreement to secure the long-term tariff arrangements, we will fund the greater share of the development cost of the first phase of the port. This agreement is expected to result in an additional capital expenditure attributable to us of about $525 million in relation to the port. The pipeline is progressing well. 87% land access has been secured, up from 54% in January.
Two underground river crossings have been completed, one, of which is the longest of its type in Brazil; and pipeline is ahead of schedule. Civil work for the filtration plant are underway and at the ports. We've started building the iron ore pier and breakwater having completed the 2.9 kilometer long main bridge. Through our ongoing expansion studies, we have increased the total resource volume to 5.3 billion tons, which supports the expansion of project beyond 26.5 million tons. 
Beyond these four projects that are well underway, we are progressing towards approval decisions in relation to the development of two further high-quality growth projects: the 225,000 ton per annum Quellaveco copper project in Peru; and the 4.3 million ton per annum Grosvenor hard coking coal project in Australia. Again, like all our major projects, these are long life and low cost positioned in the lower half of the cost curve and with resource basis that support long production lives.
Finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the macro economic outlook. At the time of our results last year, there was considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy. Some economists were worried about a potential double-dip in the U.S. and a sharp slowdown in China, but these fears proved unfounded. Over the last year, the world economy has grown more strongly than expected. Crucially, the U.S. economy has improved significantly, and in recent weeks, we've seen evidence of a market acceleration. Stronger consumer spending is supporting GDP growth, and the latest manufacturing ISM survey points to healthy growth early in 2011. With Chinese growth easing slightly, a stronger U.S. economy is vital to sustaining the global economic recovery and demand for our commodities over the next few years. 
As we've seen, there has been some volatility in the economies and in commodities in the shorter term, and we expect this to continue. In the longer term, however, the fundamentals for the mining industry look very strong. China, India and other emerging economies are still in the early stages of their catch-up with the advanced economies. As the living standards improve, Asia's middle class will expand dramatically, generating significant gains into spreadable incomes and demand for more consumable durables.
In addition, there should be huge increases in spending on infrastructure to support the development of these economies. U.S. policymakers also recognize the need to step up infrastructure investment. In this environment, we expect continuing robust demand growth for all of our key commodities over the next two decades. The continued urbanization of China will drive demand for our core commodities such as finished steel. Steel consumption per capita has been rising dramatically in China over the last five to 10 years and has caught up with and recently overtaken the U.S. We expect per capita steel consumption in China to reach around 450 to 500 kilograms per capita as urbanization increases to 60% over the next nine to 10 years. In absolute terms, this represents a very significant increase in annual finished steel demand of an additional 250 million tons. And this is very good news for iron ore and metallurgical coal. 
Not only is China embedding a huge quantity of our core commodities in its infrastructure, there is significant amount of planned urban regeneration and renewal. The scope for growth in demand is significant, and it is perhaps the most surprise that we see the consumption of high value material such as stainless steel growing at a rapid rate. We believe that we have a good handle on China, and this supports a very constructive outlook for our core commodities.
In summary, the set of results reflects delivery on all fronts. We are achieving operational excellence. We are continuing to drive our businesses down and the cost curves. We have one of the most exciting growth profiles in the industry. We have strengthened our balance sheet. We are making excellent progress on our divestments, and we are very positive about the outlook for our core commodities. This shows that we are in a great position to achieve our ambition to becoming the leading global mining company. The investment, the partner and the employer of choice. Thank you very much, everybody, for your attention, and we'd now like to take questions. Thank you."

Let me start with the question on the dividend. Look, what we are saying is that taking into account the group's substantial investment program today and going forward, the future earnings potential and the continuing need to protect and ensure a robust balance sheet, what we are saying is that surplus cash will be returned to shareholders. But clearly, as well, as you point out, we've got a significant growth pipeline. We will prioritize that growth pipeline as per the returns, timing, and it will be on that basis that we will determine the level of dividend going forward. Your second point of questioning is around Platinum. I think that Neville won't say it but I'll say it on behalf of the Platinum group. I think they've done an outstanding job. We've surpassed the target on productivity. We said we were going to reach seven square meters per employee. We've reached 7.06 square meters. We're looking at another 7.3 square meters this year and that productivity continuing to ramp up. This is the third year that they've delivered cost virtually flat year-on-year. And I think as I said earlier, given electricity prices increasing by 25%, 26%, given labor increases representing a very substantial part of the underlying cost in the neighborhood of 8%, 9%, it is challenging, but they've done an outstanding job.

This year, it does present further challenges. However, the opportunity to produce answers at a slightly higher grade than we did last year means that we are still in line to achieve essentially flat nominal costs for this year."

I think it'll be good for the group to hear a little bit about the progress that we've made because it is quite impressive and will be very helpful, I think, to this audience. In terms of your question about productivity, it is quite impressive. We see productivity increases almost across the group starting first with what Seamus has done in Australia followed by what Neville is doing in Platinum. Chris is not here, but we've done phenomenally well in Kumba. So it's virtually across the group that we're seeing this kind of gain, and it really comes back to the approach that we're taking around asset optimization, our focus on the operation, every single one benefiting from the global expertise in group. And maybe I could just touch on the asset optimizations because that's really where it's being driven from. We delivered $3 billion of value this past year. And as I said, it's a year ahead of schedule. I have to tell you, frankly, I didn't think we would get to this level so fast. We're now looking at how we further capitalize on this, and I would have to say, and I don't want to give you too much food for thought here, but the further uplift to the group is quite sizable. How are we doing that? Well, in 2010, we performed five operational reviews in asset optimization, targeting and identifying specific opportunities and capitalizing on our technical excellence. Although this is early days from those reviews, we identified about $170 million of value just in those few alone. We're looking to further standardize and implement the measures that we're putting in place and really work our way up the maturity curve to excellence across the group through asset optimization. And I think in procurement as well, we're also I just should mention that because I think the value there has been fantastic, and we see a lot more to come. So again, not to oversell the progress that we're making here, but I think it is evidence of the ability to deliver and the focus that everybody has on their operations, and moving into a very competitive cost position. And I think the embedded value in the company, in the organization across the board continues to be quite high.

With the mining permit that we've got in August last year and with the installation license for the beneficiation plant, the tailings dam we're doing in December, we are on track now up to start the civil works. We have about 40% of the Earthworks completed at the beneficiation plant. We're going to start civils now in March. So this is all according to our schedule, and we are slightly, I would say, ahead of the game in that site. In the pipeline, we have about 87% of the landowners secured. If you look at the state of Rio, where the pipeline is starting, so the pipeline is coming up from the port to the mine. We have about 97% almost finished of the Earthworks done. About end of January, 100 kilometers of pipe welded and installed. So about 20% of the whole pipeline is already finished. We at the port the last bit, at the port, we are about two and half months ahead of schedule. We have the bridge ready, the pier is just over half of it done, started the breakwater.

The option comes around every three years and is exercisable by originally it was an army or state entity. If that was transferred across to Cadelco, it's exercisable for a period of 30 days, January. The next one comes up in January 2012. I think it's a broad comment. The option has not been in the money any time in the last 30 years, and I don't think there's any reason why we would expect that to change. The formula that it's based upon is reasonably complex and is fairly confidential. That is based upon, amongst other things, the previous five years of earnings. And obviously, the high prices that we've had in copper over the past five years further push up their price of exercising that option."

Then I'll",1334,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. It's very good to see you all this morning, and thank you for coming. 
I'll start big giving you the highlights of what has been a strong first half to the year, despite escalating cost impacts. Then I'll demonstrate how we transformed and positioned ourselves over the last 4 years to face challenges no matter where we were in the cycle. And we'll also look at the operational performances of the business. Rene will take you through the financials and I'll outline our growth profile and how our new production will improve further our cost positions. And finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the long-term picture.
So firstly, I'd like to remind you of the journey that we've been on with our strategy, embedding a culture that focuses on business excellence. We are investing in the commodities we believe have the most attractive fundamentals. We have a well-diversified portfolio of attractive commodities, with exposure to the full cycle of the development of emerging countries. We now have a performance mindset in safety, productivity, cost containment and project delivery. Our focus has been on people and driving performance with everyone getting involved. So the highlights.
Our strong financial performance in the first half is reflective of the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. These have enabled us to capture the maximum benefit from increased commodity prices. The terrible tragedy in Japan has shown the world the extraordinary resilience of the Japanese people and this was also evident in our customers who recovered strongly following the disasters. Our close relationships with customers enabled us to redirect shipments at very short notice. And this in turn were satisfied at the right place and at the right time. 
Total group operating profit is $6 million, up 38%. Operating profit from our core businesses was up 45%. Our underlying earnings are $3.1 billion with earnings per share at $2.58, a 40% increase. All our core business units recorded higher operating profits. Asset optimization and supply-chain programs have delivered a combined $1.3 billion of value in the first 6 months of the year. This is how we maximize margin, by capturing the full benefit of strong prices and minimizing the impact of those events beyond our control, be it weather, be it cost inflation or infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front.  Our decision in 2009 to sustain investment on our big 4 projects will pay off as we generate substantial cash flows. So the successful delivery of Barro Alto is only just the start. 
Our other major, 3 major projects are coming along extremely well. We're now in a position to take full advantage of robust demand, as we deliver some of the lowest capital intensity and operating cost volumes to attractive markets. 
And in addition, we have another $66 billion worth of growth projects awaiting approval. It's a very strong picture. And I'm therefore pleased to announce we have raised our interim dividend by 12% to $0.28 per share.
Before we turn to the operating performance, I'd like to talk for a few minutes about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo-American and for me. Over the past 5 years, we have had sustained safety improvement. And I'm therefore extremely disappointed and deeply saddened to report that 10 of our employees lost their lives in work-related incidents in the first half of the year. Having said this, it is important to note 93% of our operations had no fatalities and a number of our individual months have achieved exceptional performance, including the mine platinum achieving -- recently achieving a South African industry record of 8 million fatality-free shifts, The new mine in South Africa has recently achieved 13 million lost time injury-free man hours. And no matter what the record though, 10 deaths are 10 too many and there are no ifs and there is no buts. Every man and woman working on our sites has a right to return home safely. So let me assure you we are relentless in driving towards 0 harm.
Looking at the first half of 2011. We see a story of two quarters, the first marked by severe weather and a second all about recovery. We acted fast as a line group. We put in place recovery plans and we achieved a swift turnaround, and I expect this momentum to continue as we've moved through the second half of the year.
Turning to input cost. We are not immune to the pressures industry is facing. Prices for some key input commodities have escalated dramatically. As you can see from the chart, market sulfuric acid prices are up 60%. Oil is up 27%. And this is in addition to the higher salary demand in Chile, in South Africa and Australia. And Rene will take you through how this has impacted our cost position, but we have mitigated some of the impacts through our supply-chain and asset-optimization programs.
Looking at our Global Supply Chain. We are delivering real benefit to the bottom line. The rate of increase in the prices of our key inputs is much lower than wider market escalation. And whether as large off-road tires or dump trucks, price however, is only part of the picture. Solid partnerships with critical suppliers insure we can secure supply for existing operations and future projects. We're also working closely with our suppliers to identify the best ways of achieving greater tire longevity and fuel efficiency for our vehicles.
Asset optimization continues to exceed expectations. And having delivered on our 2011 target a year early, we believe that there is more value to be unlocked here. We are confident. We have gained momentum in embedding operational excellence across the group. And this year, we intend to complete 7 operation reviews. 5 reviews were completed last year, and we've identified up to $400 million of potential savings out of that. 
At our Australian coal business, for example, we are already leading the industry in open cut mine productivity. We applied the same approach to our underground mines. The long wall 100 program launched less than a year ago exceeded its target of 100 cutting hours in just 6 months which led to a production record in the month of June.
Now let's look at the businesses. And I'm going to take you through iron ore, nickel, Thermal Coal and diamonds. And as John Mackenzie, Neville and the same as the talk about their businesses. 
Starting with iron ore and Manganese. Operating profit was $2.5 billion, up 54%. And despite heavy rains, Kumba delivered 22 million tons of product sales, and we expect Kumba to recover the production shortfall by the end of the year. 
In Brazil, Amapa is a turnaround story. In the first half of last year, Amapa recorded a loss of $7 million. In the first half of this year, we've recorded a gain of $45 million. As you all know, we have 2 major iron ore projects under construction. Kolomela is 94% complete. The plan has been handed over for coal commissioning. Hot commissioning is expected to start in the third quarter, with the first work that through the system this year. And as you are aware, the Minas Rio project faces many regulatory challenges. Nevertheless, we continue to make progress. Civil works for the bit of the initiation plant and the tailing them have been underway since March.
A strong result also for Thermal Coal, driven by higher export prices and stable production can be seen here. And as many of our other operations, Cerrejon had a big increase in rain stoppages. So it was great that we ended the half year with production down just 3%. We've made good progress on our projects, Zibulo is ramping up substantially and the Cerrejon expansive project is set for shareholders approval in the third quarter. I'll now invite Seamus to come up and talk about Met Coal."

Metallurgical Coal's operating profit of $491 million was an increase of 87% in the prior year and was an outstanding result given the challenges we faced early in the year with disastrous floods and one of the largest cyclones to hit Queensland on record.  The first half profit was in fact a record H1 profit for the business. 
On Prices, a positive working relationship with customers, early engagement allowed the business to effectively manage the flood impact on our customers and to lead the market in settling quarterly pricing. The benchmark price of $330 a ton that we set in quarter two is in fact the record had coking coal price.
Production was to be impacted by these flood events, particularly in quarter 1 and a production recovery plan was put into place.  The actions of that is to recover in quarter 2 at a faster rate than our competitors, allowing us to fully capitalize on the record prices that we had set. 
As a result of this work, production is expected to increase in the second half of the year, as operations return to normalized levels in June. And this build up of momentum of the second quarter which was itself a 77% production increase over the first quarter. We are expecting a heavy wet season starting again in quarter four and to minimize future rain impacts, we put together a comprehensive program at our open cut site said it includes coding road surfaces, drainage to reduce ingress and doubling up pit pumping capacity.
Looking forward, near-term production will be driven by asset optimization initiatives over the next 3 years. And of course, delivery of the first page of the Grosvenor project in 2016. And we expect approval for that project in the next 12 months as we've said previously. 
We should not however, that a cap in prices came proposed by the Australian government. This posed a risk for planned future investments in Australia. Mining projects in Australia will face the full impact of the carbon price from day 1 of production, with no transitional assistance. And this will of course will divert resources and funding that could otherwise have been engaged in abatement technology. 
We have been proactive in engaging with the government to modify this scheme, and we will continue to work with the government to look forward a better way of pricing carbon that won't impact on these planned investments in Australia. Cindy?"

These production issues were mitigated by increases in production from Mogalakwena, sweeping and sweeping material.

While copper prices was somewhat volatile on average, the copper price for the first half was a record. 
Our copper production for the first half was down 8% in the prior year, primarily as a result of 2Q reasons. Firstly, severe rain disruptions is a result of rainfall that is 4x to 5x the annual average which came down in first 3 months of the year. And then secondly, the anticipated grade decline at Los Bronces. Some of this was offset by a significant increase in three-put at Los Bronces following a series of initiatives to increase our throughput in the sag mill which is the bottleneck for our production process. 
As you've heard from Cynthia, we're facing the same broad pressures in costs and also a weaker U.S. dollar in Chile. Having said that, we do expect a stronger performance in the second half. There's a positive upside to our sales as inventory accumulated during the project report shipload or repairs are expected to be sold in the second half. 
Production is also expected to be stronger. Collahuasi have been integrated through a throughput despite a loss week of production during the recent snowstorm. Los Bronces production will also increase, particularly as the expansion project comes on stream in the fourth quarter. And this will be delivering new volumes at a low cash cost. This also leads a significant step-up in our copper production for next year as the production -- as the project is up and running. 
At Collahuasi, all of our expansion projects are progressing well.  
Turning to our Quellaveco project in Peru. The project's approval has been delayed compared to the previous guidance and we're now targeting approval during 2012. We continue to work on the projects, consulting and working with all levels of government in order to achieve the water permits that we require. And then the dialogue process with the local communities is making very good progress. However, it's still going to take more time successfully to complete this prices."

Sales from Codemin and nobody were up 21% at a time of strong nickel pricing. In this half year, we successfully delivered Barro Alto on-time and on budget in local currency terms. This is a major milestone. And we believe this is one of the most successful green field nickel project delivered in recent times. There are a few nickel projects able to deliver product to specification. Barro Alto has done that from the start. Barro Alto is ramping up well and we expect to reach full production in the second half of next year. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. And with a cash cost of around $4 per pound, Barro Alto will generate significant cash flows.
De Beers production totaled 15.5 million carats recovered, following strong growth in demand from the Middle East and China regional markets. De Beers sales during the first half were larger than the full year sales in 2009. Contributing $450 million of operating profit to Anglo American. 
So building on a strong financial performance in the first half, we fully expect an even stronger second half to this year. With that, I now hand over to René to take you through the financials."

Despite operation in China in the first quarter that Cynthia described. I'm very pleased to report that 41% increase in earnings. So the level of earnings of $3.1 billion after an effective tax rate of 31.8",935,"Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. Despite operation in China in the first quarter that Cynthia described. I'm very pleased to report that 41% increase in earnings. So the level of earnings of $3.1 billion after an effective tax rate of 31.8%, very much in line with the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year and we are confirming the 32% tax rate for the full year. 
CapEx of $2.3 billion, we are confirming our guidance for the full year of $6 billion, as we are ramping up the project at Minas Rio. In the first 6 months, we spent $300 million at Minas Rio. We are projecting to spend $1.3 billion for the full year. 
Net debt was down with $600 million in the first 6 months, down to $6.8 billion. This number includes a net cash position in South Africa of $1.7 billion. 
Over the next slide, I will go through price exchange, volume and cash balances. Let me highlight a couple of things on this slide. Okay, I think profit from Corporation went up 45%. The level of CPI inflation on the weighted average gold as pick up to the point 3.9% in the first 6 months of this year. For last year, the number was basis was 3.3%. 
We also highlight on this slide the cash cost variance as we said, the age at Platinum, as well as disruptions that Cynthia described $250 million negative impact. Positive variance from associates must be due to the substantial increase in contribution from De Beers. De Beers contributed $450 million in the first 6 months in the back of 35% increase in rough diamonds.
Turning to traded commodities price variance. You see the increase in Platinum price and an increase in around basket price just below 20,000 for the first half of this year, an increase of 16% due to the increase in Platinum price, but even more to increase in Platinum price which an average whether $775 an ounce in the first 6 months, an increase of 68% compared to the similar period last year. 
Copper on average, realized price of $4.22 compared to $308 in the previous period. At the end of this year, at the end of June, sorry, we had 108,000 tons of copper positively priced at $4.28. As the volatility due to macro adjustment will increase following the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion. 
Turning to the books commodities and first iron ore. Like the rest of the industry, we have moved to shorter term prices. Cynthia mentioned the production declined in Kumba. Kumba sometime was able to maintain the same level of export sales in excess of 18 million tons in the first 6 months of this year. Kumba has also negotiated an extension of the interim pricing agreement for another 12 months up to July 2012 at the branded price of $65 a ton. 
Turning to coal, similar situation as the one I described for iron ore with a move to a shorter term prices. In fact, Met Coal was able to outperform the spot par -- the spot price in the second quarter and have also settled for the second quarter for hot coking coal at $315 a ton just like the lower available of the second quarter. 
Thermal Coal in 2010, we saw the expiration of the five-year contract with the FDA. We met at $67 a ton which means we are fully exposed to short-term prices in Thermal Coal.
Exchange and volume variance, we like the rest of the industry we are negatively impacted by the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar, the negative exchange variance of $519 all due to start beginning trend and Australian dollar. 
Leading to volume variance of $124 million as especially Kumba and Platinum, we are able to mitigate the production decline by drawing down on the available of finished goods inventory in Kumba and pipeline inventory in Platinum.
Turning to cost of variance. Cynthia described the level of inflationary pressures that we are seeing them on input cost. For the first 6 months, we are reporting a 7% above CPI inflation in increased costs is that this number includes the impact of lower production. If you normalize the level of production in the first 6 months, this number is down to 5%. In that way, we are projecting for the full year. So 5% above CPI inflation for the full year. 
We had a very strong operating cash flow of $5.2 billion for the first 6 months despite the negative working capital movement of $800 million due to higher prices. You also see some proceeds from the divestment of $5 billion following the completion of the divestment of as it at the beginning of the year, back markets and leashing. In thermal divestment, we are going through the regulatory approval process for as John mentioned, between in Tarmac and Lafarge in the U.K. and we are preparing the launch of the divestment of first in the second half of this year. 
This update $6 million in June exclude the debt in De Beers which is down to $1.4 billion to end of June compared to $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. 
Cynthia mentioned increased in the Indian dividend at 12%.  In terms of capital management, the priorities are first to fund our organic growth and we are expecting the level of CapEx to remain about $6 million for the next few years. We will continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisition and any excess cash will be returned to our shareholders. Thank you."

O",1081,"So far, you've heard about the solid foundation we have built. We've delivered on our promises to lift productivity and we are moving down the cost curve. We have the skills and the structure to successfully execute large scale, very complex projects. 
Our big 4 projects are all on track. Barro Alto is in production. Los Bronces is close behind. Kolomela is being commissioned and Minas Rio is also on track. I've said it before and I'll say it again, our growth profile sets us apart, both in terms of being well-spread across our suite of core commodities and across the different times. This is not distant growth, this is growth now. 
Our long-life, low-cost projects are coming on stream in time to benefit from the robust demand and pricing environment. At the current copper price of around $4.40 per pound and nickel of around $11 per pound, we are set to generate very substantial cash flows. 
We have the potential to double production over the next decade, with the delivery of an $85 billion pipeline covering more than 100 projects. And this is up from $70 billion I've mentioned previously. This reflects the progress we have been making in moving our projects through the pipeline. And you can see the potential for growth from our world-class project pipeline that spans the breadth of commodities attracting the greatest value. We invest in those commodities with the strongest fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles and that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders. 
We can claim ownership of the most diversified project pipeline in mining and we're positioned to take full advantage of development in emerging economies which I'll talk about in a few minutes. 
I'll explain later on the challenges the industry faces from which we are not immune. Notwithstanding over the past 6 months significant progress has been made. As you can see, 14 projects have progressed through the next approval stage. And many more have progressed through earlier phases of studies. But there's more to come. In 2011, our spending on exploration the studies were more than doubled. 
You've heard us talk about first half performance. The challenges we've faced and a solid foundation for growth. Our focus on constantly improving and our cost position is relentless and the delivery of our big 4 projects will further enhance our position. 
Since 2005, our resource base has underground -- undergone explosive growth, as a result of many exploration successes and acquisitions. We are restocking our pipeline continuously to sustained growth for the long term. Take nickel, for example, we have increased our resource base by more than 9x. And this doesn't include the world-class discovery, Morro Sem Bone in Brazil. For iron ore, our resource base has grown by almost 4x, not least as we have defined further the resource at Minas Rio taking it from 1.2 billion tons at the time of acquisition to 5.3 billion tons today. 
We have resources, the infrastructure and the people to deliver. And this places us in a very competitive position. 
Now let me say a few words on the macro environment. In the short-term demand for commodities is likely to be volatile. The sovereign debt prices in the U.S. and Europe have passed some shadows over the outlook for the demand in the next few years. In addition, growth in the major emerging economies is slowing, as policymakers seek to restrain inflation. Still, the longer-term fundamentals for commodity demand remained strong. 
The urbanization of China and the emerging economies will ensure demand for the commodities we produce remain strong for the long term. At present, some 20 million people almost a population of Australia are moving to China's cities each year. In China's current five-year plan, more than 36 million social housing units will be constructed. 10 million this year alone. Urbanization will require significant steel and other raw materials over the next few decades. 
China's industrialization and urbanization will provide additional long-term growth and demand for our raw materials required for construction of roads and rails like in cities, ports, power transmission networks and heavy industry. And let's not forget, this is not only about China. India in the other emerging economies are following a similar sort of development cycle. 
As development continues in China and emerging economies, the demand growth for the commodities reproduced will ship in parallel to the increasing sophistication of these economies. And there's no doubt in my mind we will benefit from this shift. 
Demand growth in emerging economies however, is only half the price picture. The other half is the inability of supply to keep up with demand growth and this is caused by a wide variety of factors such as skill, labor shortages, regulatory delays and infrastructure constraints. 
We see in Australia, for example, permitting times which 5 years ago on average would've taken about 12 months for a project. Now it can take up to about 3 years. And a similar story occurs with full capacity in Queensland or rail capacity in South Africa or political uncertainty in many resource-rich countries. And coupled with grades in existing ore bodies, a picture emerges of supply consistently underdelivering against market expectations. And this is unlikely to improve in the short term. 
So to sum up, we have been on a journey to transform Anglo American. We have delivered on commitments made along the way. Today, we've reported on progress on these commitments. You've heard this morning, a substantial rise in operating profits, the benefits of asset optimization and supply chain programs and our actions to mitigate cost pressures and move down the cost curve. Above all, you've heard about where we are going as a company. The foundations we have laid to get us there and the delivery of our very substantial production growth. We have delivered Barro Alto, a large complex project.  Another 3 major projects are on schedule to be delivered into this highly supportive demand environment. An $85 billion, 100-project diversified pipeline will allow us to double or more than double production over the next decade. And this is why I am confident in saying, our real growth is still to come and our eyes remain focused firmly on becoming the leading global mining company. 
So with that everyone, thank you very much for your attention and I'd like to take questions. First from London, couple questions and then from South Africa and then on the phone line. Jason?"

First of all, our plan for projects in Peru have not changed. We congratulate President Humala on his electoral victory and we look forward to working with him, and we remain committed to those 2 copper projects Quellaveco and . The feasibility study for Quellaveco has been completed. And as John said, we are awaiting approval of critical water permits. What I would also say to you is we did elect as a result of some of the events this year in particular, with respect to other mining projects, we decided to engage in a dialogue table with the local community, with NGOs and with the regional president in the Quellaveco area. As a result of that, as John mentioned, it has caused a delay. On the other hand, we are unique in terms of what it is that we have done in having that dialogue table, and we've also been engaging with the new minister and others at the central government level. So the answer to your question is I think we're going about this the right way. I think we have done something very different from what has been done in the past. The regional president is with us all along the way very committed, and we are also getting the same sort of feedback from the newly elected official. So the outlook I think is positive. As I said, we continue to be committed, but we do expect a confirmation of the project to be next year. On the question of South Africa. We have been very clear about our position nationalization first of all is not the policy of the South African government. Nationalization does not work. Mining makes a massive contribution to the economies, of resource-producing countries and certainly in the case of South Africa. We constitute, the industry constitutes 8.6% of South African GDP, Anglo American alone is 2.5% and actually the largest beneficiaries of South African mining are the employees and the South African government and the suppliers to the mining industry. So Jason again we have made ourselves clear on where we are on this. We have gotten consistent readings from the government and expression of an absolute position on this, whether it's from the Minister or the President or the deputy President and we continue to believe in South Africa. Now if you turn to our project pipeline going forward, we are looking at I mention $85 billion I've mentioned before $16 billion of near-term projects to be approved, about 50% of that will be in South America. And so we are very, very diverse, in terms of our geographic footprint and we'll continue to invest heavily, not just in South Africa, but in South America. Other questions yes."

Just on the strategy side, if you look for 6 months I think 3 of your major projects will be in production. So is the strategy just to continue to fill your CapEx pipeline like your peer group or can Anglo also be a free cash flow story with higher dividends to run alongside your higher production base?

First question on the strategy looking forward and whether it's all about projects I think is what you're asking and whether the cash flows will be going directly in the projects are feeding back into the market. I think that we, as I've said, we've got a massive project pipeline. Thank heavens we didn't stop the spend a few years ago, with many of our peers did stop the spend. We will continue to invest going forward.  We are reaping the benefits from those 4 projects. We're going to be seeing an EBITDA contribution in the next few years at today's prices of more than $6 billion. Next year, we are looking at a CapEx this year as René said, it's about $6 billion. Next year it will be about $6.5 billion a year after, similar sort of run rate. And as we go forward and as we look at the dynamics of the markets and how we're positioned, how we're performing operationally, how those projects are coming on stream, we will make a determination as to how much, to what extent we will increase those dividends. So we have a progressive dividend policy that is either to maintain or increase. And it's really on that basis. It's on that basis as to whether we are going to -- which options we're going to pursue and actually we can pursue many of them at the same time. The second question is about Platinum, will higher production offset the cost inflation. Clearly, cost inflation has been a big, big challenge in South Africa. You're aware that labor rates have labor cost have increased by about 9% this year. Electricity is up by about 26% in line with the last couple of years. I think Neville and the group in Platinum have actually done a phenomenal job in containing cost in nominal terms over the last 3 years, and we've done that 2008, 2009, 2010 between 11,000, 12,000 and our target is to get it to 12,000 per ounce for the rest of the year. We know that is a challenge. So higher production will help, but that's not all that's needed. We need to also increase productivities. We need to capture more out of procurements. We need to think even more about the structure of the organization. Neville's done a phenomenal job of restructuring and driving efficiencies. But there's still more that we can do. As of the organization last year plus procurement, yield is about $700 million of value and he's got even more plans to do greater amounts of that going forward. So it's really across the business. Neville, you want to just comment and were quick Neville is happy with that. all right, there's one question from you and then we'll go to South Africa and I'll try to share these questions with my colleagues around this room because we've got a great group here."

We have on Spread 3 which is all in the state of Rio. We have about 99% there virtually complete.  87% on spread too and 65% on spread one. So I would say making very, very good progress I'd be happy to sit with you and kind of give you the details I have a lot of details on this. I can also say that we are -- I mean, you have everybody in this executive team is right behind ministry. I'm trying to do everything to support. We continue to drill the resource. I've stated, I notified you that we identified or confirmed 5.3 billion tons. It's going to be quite a bit more than that and I'll come back and give you an update at the year-end performance. In terms of CapEx it's still $5 billion, so we haven't changed that, and we spent $1.9 billion to date. So again does anybody else would be happy with lots and lots and lots of detail. The port is actually ahead of schedule by about a month and a half and a per construction is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. And we've got as I said civil works about 15% of that has been completed. So that's not too bad. on the Orth worksite around a bit depreciation planned about 73% is complete. So a lot of bit -- a lot of pieces to this story. But I think that's certainly, we are pretty confident that this is going to be a great cash generator. We believe that the cash cost will be on the very low end of the cost curve. We think the quality of this resource is very, very high. It is absolutely a Tier 1 resource. You've heard us talk about the tariff that we've locked in for the long-term at about $5.15 per ton. I mean, that's phenomenal in today's environment. So I think it's looking pretty good. But that's not to say we don't have our challenges and I said to you all before, I cannot guarantee anything. I mean, a lot of this is out of our control, but we've got hundreds of people on the ground working day to access the permits and the licenses. Okay, I need to go to South Africa. So South Africa?"

And starting first in Australia. I mean, we are -- you would be very well aware of those challenges there. Now what are we doing about it? We are not waiting for those projects to even be confirmed. We are preparing for those projects now. So in the case of Grosvenor, macro project in Australia, again we don't expect confirmation until the first quarter of next year. On the other hand, we're looking at our needs from a critical resource standpoint and capacity standpoint from a young talent standpoint. From a particular functional standpoint so whether we're looking for engineers, or geologists or miners, we are preparing and understanding person-by-person, man-by-man what our needs are for the next number of years for the next 5 years. And it's an extremely helpful process. It is multifaceted, multilayered and Seamus and the team going to places like Canada, Germany, United States to start recruiting for those projects for years to come.

Okay, your question about Copebras, Catalao and Peace River coal. Maybe I could just touch on Peace River coal. So why did we retained this.
We, Seamus and the team from Australia have done quite a bit of time on the ground. We think that it's all Metallurgical Coal.  We are only producing about 1 million tons and even that's this year, but we think there is more potential and it's about sharing expertise. It's about applying best practices and doing things differently. So we think this resource does have the potential to increase production substantially. We haven't yet defined exactly to what extent, but I will say substantially. And so that is now part of Seamus' group, in terms of go progress in Catalao. This businesses will be managed of these our core businesses within Anglo American and which is now determining exactly under which individual, but we believe that they're quality, they're assets in the case of Copebras. Given where the phosphate business is today, the margins that we are reaping, we're looking at and assessing how this businesses is likely to revolve. So that's really where it is. Catalao, we've identified a lot more resources and they in Brazil, there are substantially more and we are looking at seeing how we can actually expand that operation."

First question I'm not going to answer but only to say that $400 million do so just from those 5 operation reviews we are doing 7 this year and already we've identified substantial amount that we have yet to deliver some of those operations. We're working on how that's going to flow through to the bottom line and when. We haven't yet taken a decision about how we're going to show up to the market and we'll probably do that either year-end results. In terms of the question on outlook, Keith, we actually have increased the prices on all the long-term prices for our commodities. So with every single one. I think we've made those increases and we think actually for every one of our commodities the growth actually looks very, very strong. We've got average growth on a platinum side of 3% to 4%. We think that the market is pretty much in balance right now. Copper obviously had we expect a significant deficit this year of around 500,000 tons at least. We and longer-term demand in the neighborhood of about 3% to 4%. China representing in the near term of about 7%. I think in terms of iron ore and Met Coal. Met Coal has come up by 8% year-on-year thus far and the outlook is continues to be very, very strong. We are seeing steel production obviously, come up significantly in starting first in China, but across the world, including Europe and the U.S. So I would say overall, we are -- despite that volatility and despite that their business, we think that the consumption of our commodities, all of our commodities will be very strong, both in the near, medium and the long term. And obviously I did also mention on the Platinum side. We think that there is on a lot of upside, given that the Platinum will be coming on even more strongly out into the future. So growth there I mean, we saw a growth this year thus far of the market in Platinum of about 7%. On the auto catalyst that, it was up by over 50%. I mean, it's fantastic. And again we'll come back and talk to you more about were Platinum outlook. I know Neville will, but we think there's a lot of upside in the market there.
Okay, everybody. We need to wrap it up. But David, you have a quick question. A burning question."

But I'm not surprised if you continue to ask the question. So with respect to Platinum. Let me just back up a little bit and put it in perspective from where we sit. Our number",588,"Okay, first question, yes, I have to say I am a little tired of the question. But I'm not surprised if you continue to ask the question. So with respect to Platinum. Let me just back up a little bit and put it in perspective from where we sit. Our number 1 objective is to deliver shareholder value across all of our businesses. That -- let's be clear about that.  And this means we continuously review the entire Anglo American portfolio of businesses and our position in that portfolio. This includes the ownership of Anglo-American platform. However, our strategy remains clear. And we focus on commodities that we believe will deliver the best return to the economic cycle. And with those commodities, we focus on Tier 1 assets that have large-scale long-life, have low cost profiles and offer clear expansion potential. And we remain committed to maximizing the value of these synergies while reviewing the portfolio structure. We believe PGMs are highly attractive and they have fantastic long-term fundamentals. PGMs provide material exposure to late cycle development of the emerging countries and a shift towards carbon production technology and our Platinum assets represent one if not the best Tier 1 resource position in the world. I think in terms of our intervention and our involvement in the Platinum business, I don't think there can be a question about that. We have made significant impact and improvements over the years with Neville and the team to achieve best practice to Anglo American standard. And applying expertise both within the Platinum business, but also from Anglo American. We've improved the safety performance, that is down by 70% since 2007. Headcount has been reduced by about 30,000. We've had flat cost for 3 years running. We've got another challenges this year.
Productivity has increased hugely and we are benefiting from the Platinum business, as they are benefiting from us. I think the group structure is highly effective business are benefiting from the synergies of Anglo American's global scale and broader financial and technical resources. And I think this clearly demonstrates, it has been demonstrated through the economic benefits delivered year-to-date through asset optimizations as an example of about $300 million or procurement of 100.
And let me put this into context. Platinum's assets are the equivalent of the cover of iron ore, but they're not carved up or co-owned by '10 Joe or BHB or FMG. And in the bulk base of Met Coal, BHB has 50% of BMA. So we think that these are great assets. We think that we're adding substantial value. We think that they're adding value to us. And given the market outlook of Platinum and PGMs in general, we think that the returns of this business will be that much more attractive and add that much more to Anglo American going forward.
Okay, with that everybody, sorry, David. Question about Finland. We do have a lot of work going on in Northern Finland. I can't share it with you as much as I would like to today. But we will come back at the year-end results. We believe where are you, when we have confirmed the resource and the makeup of that resource and give you the specifics around it.
So with that everybody, I thank you again for your attention. I thank you for yours in South Africa and for those on the phone. We certainly appreciate your support. We appreciate your interest. We appreciate the time that you've spent with us today. Thank you"

Then I'll d",1339,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. It's very good to see you all this morning, and thank you for coming. 
I'll start big giving you the highlights of what has been a strong first half to the year despite escalating cost impacts. Then I'll demonstrate how we transformed and positioned ourselves over the last 4 years to face challenges no matter where we were in the cycle. And we'll also look at the operational performances of the business. Rene will take you through the financials, and I'll outline our growth profile and how our new production will improve further our cost positions. And finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the long-term picture.
So firstly, I'd like to remind you of the journey that we've been on with our strategy, embedding a culture that focuses on business excellence. We are investing in the commodities we believe have the most attractive fundamentals. We have a well-diversified portfolio of attractive commodities with exposure to the full cycle of the development of emerging countries. We now have a performance mindset in safety, productivity, cost containment and project delivery. Our focus has been on people and driving performance with everyone getting involved. So the highlights.
Our strong financial performance in the first half is reflective of the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. These have enabled us to capture the maximum benefit from increased commodity prices. 
The terrible tragedy in Japan has shown the world the extraordinary resilience of the Japanese people, and this was also evident in our customers who recovered strongly following the disasters. Our close relationships with customers enabled us to redirect shipments at very short notice. And this ensured demand was satisfied at the right place and at the right time. 
Total group operating profit is $6 billion, up 38%. Operating profit from our core businesses was up 45%. Our underlying earnings are $3.1 billion, with earnings per share at $2.58, a 40% increase. All our core business units recorded higher operating profits. 
Asset optimization and supply chain programs have delivered a combined $1.3 billion of value in the first 6 months of the year. This is how we maximize margin, by capturing the full benefit of strong prices and minimizing the impact of those events beyond our control, be it weather, be it cost inflation or infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front. Our decision in 2009 to sustain investment on our big 4 projects will pay off as we generate substantial cash flows. So the successful delivery of Barro Alto is only just the start. 
Our other major -- 3 major projects are coming along extremely well. We're now in a position to take full advantage of robust demand as we deliver some of the lowest capital intensity and operating cost volumes to attractive markets. And in addition, we have another $66 billion worth of growth projects awaiting approval. 
It's a very strong picture. And I'm therefore pleased to announce we have raised our interim dividend by 12% to $0.28 per share.
Before we turn to the operating performance, I'd like to talk for a few minutes about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. Over the past 5 years, we have had sustained safety improvement, and I'm therefore extremely disappointed and deeply saddened to report that 10 of our employees lost their lives in work-related incidents in the first half of the year. 
Having said this, it is important to note 93% of our operations had no fatalities, and a number of our individual months have achieved exceptional performance, including the Modikwa mine in Platinum achieving -- recently achieving a South African industry record of 8 million fatality-free shifts. The new Kolomela mine in South Africa has recently achieved 13 million lost time injury free man hours. 
And no matter what the record though, 10 deaths are 10 too many, and there's no ifs and there's no buts. Every man and woman working on our sites has a right to return home safely. So let me assure you we are relentless in driving towards 0 harm.
Looking at the first half of 2011. We see a story of 2 quarters: the first marked by severe weather and the second all about recovery. We acted fast as a an aligned group. We put in place recovery plans and we achieved a swift turnaround, and I expect this momentum to continue as we move through the second half of the year.
Turning to input costs. We are not immune to the pressures industry is facing. Prices for some key input commodities have escalated dramatically. As you can see from the chart, market sulfuric prices -- sulfuric acid prices are up 60%. Oil is up 27%. And this is in addition to the higher salary demand in Chile, in South Africa and Australia. And Rene will take you through how this has impacted our cost position, but we have mitigated some of the impacts through our supply chain and asset optimization programs.
Looking at our global supply chain. We are delivering real benefit to the bottom line. The rate of increase in the prices of our key inputs is much lower than wider market escalation. And whether its large off-road tires or dump trucks, price, however, is only part of the picture. 
Solid partnerships with critical suppliers ensure we can secure supply for existing operations and future projects. We're also working closely with our suppliers to identify the best ways of achieving greater tire longevity and fuel efficiency for our vehicles.
Asset optimization continues to exceed expectations. And having delivered on our 2011 target a year early, we believe that there is more value to be unlocked here. We are confident we have gained momentum in embedding operational excellence across the group. And this year, we intend to complete 7 operation reviews. Five reviews were completed last year, and we've identified up to $400 million of potential savings out of that. 
At our Australian Coal business, for example, we are already leading the industry in open cut mine productivity. We apply the same approach to our underground mines. The Longwall 100 Program, launched less than a year ago, exceeded its target of 100 cutting hours in just 6 months, which led to a production record in the month of June.
Now let's look at the businesses. And I'm going to take you through Iron Ore, Nickel, Thermal Coal and Diamonds and ask John Mackenzie, Neville and Seamus to talk about their businesses. 
Starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Operating profit was $2.5 billion, up 54%. And despite heavy rains, Kumba delivered 22 million tons of product sales, and we expect Kumba to recover their production shortfall by the end of the year. 
In Brazil, Amapa is a turnaround story. In the first half of last year, Amapa recorded a loss of $7 million. In the first half of this year, we've recorded a gain of $45 million. 
As you all know, we have 2 major Iron Ore projects under construction. Kolomela is 94% complete. The plan has been handed over for coal commissioning. Hot commissioning is expected to start in the third quarter, with the first ore fed through the system this year. And as you are aware, the Minas Rio project faces many regulatory challenges. Nevertheless, we continue to make progress. Civil works for the beneficiation plant and the tailing dam have been underway since March.
A strong result also for Thermal Coal driven by higher export prices and stable production can be seen here. And as many of our other operations, Cerrejon had a big increase in rain stoppages. So it was great that we ended the half year with production down just 3%. We've made good progress on our projects. Zibulo is ramping up substantially, and the Cerrejon expansive project is set for shareholders' approval in the third quarter. 
I'll now invite Seamus to come up and talk about Met Coal."

Metallurgic Coal's operating profit of $491 million was an increase of 87% on the prior year and was an outstanding result given the challenges we faced early in the year with disastrous floods and one of the largest cyclones to hit Queensland on record.  The first half profit was, in fact, a record H1 profit for the business. 
On prices, our positive working relationship with customers, early engagement allowed the business to effectively manage the flood impact on our customers and to lead the market in settling quarterly pricing. The benchmark price of $330 a ton that we set in quarter 2 is in fact a record hard coking coal price.
Production was severely impacted by these flood events, particularly in quarter 1, and a production recovery plan was put into place. The actions allowed us to recover in quarter 2 at a faster rate than our competitors, allowing us to fully capitalize on the record prices that we had set. 
As a result of this work, production is expected to increase in the second half of the year as operations return to normalized levels in June and this build on the momentum of the second quarter, which was itself a 77% production increase over the first quarter. 
We are expecting a heavy wet season starting again in quarter 4. And to minimize future rain impacts, we put together a comprehensive program at our open cut sites that includes coding haulage road surfaces, drainage buns to reduce pit water ingress and doubling up pit pumping capacity.
Looking forward, near-term production will be driven by asset optimization initiatives over the next 3 years and of course, delivery of the first stage of the Grosvenor project from 2016. And we expect approval for that project in the next 12 months as we have said previously. 
We should note, however, that the carbon prices scheme proposed by the Australian government does pose a risk of planned future investments in Australia. Mining projects in Australia will face the full impact of the carbon price from day one of production with no transitional assistance. And this will, of course -- will divert resources and funding that could otherwise be engaged in abatement technology. 
We have been proactive in engaging with the government to modify the scheme, and we will continue to work with the government to put forward a better way of pricing carbon that won't impact on these planned investments in Australia. Cynthia?"

Refined platinum volume increased by 17% to 1.17 million ounces, allowing for increased sales year-on-year. Our refined platinum production and sales guidance of 2.6 million ounces remains unchanged as we expect a better performance in the second half of the year. 
Reduction in the first half of the year was badly affected by extraordinary safety stoppages, breaks due to public holidays and long weekends and some operational issues. These production issues were mitigated with increases in production from Mogalakwena, Unki, our tail-end treatment, sweeping and sifted material. Mogalakwena, the open-pit mine, continues to perform strongly and provides Anglo American Platinum with a flexible production source. 
As we improve production, our cost and efficiency will get back to the -- back on track in the second half of this year. Our unit cost will get back down to the ZAR 12,000 per ounce level. And similarly, our productivity will increase to the 7.3 square meters per person for the second half."

Whilst copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the first half was a record. 
Our copper production for the first half was down 8% on the prior year, primarily as a result of 2 key reasons: firstly, severe rain disruptions at Collahuasi is a result of rainfall that is 4 to 5x the annual average, which is -- came down in the first 3 months of the year; and then secondly, the anticipated grade decline at Los Bronces. Some of this was offset by a significant increase in throughput at Los Bronces following a series of initiatives to increase our throughput in the SAG mill, which is the bottleneck for our production process. 
As you've heard from Cynthia, we're facing the same broad pressures in costs and also, a weaker U.S. dollar in Chile. Having said that, we do expect a stronger performance in the second half. There's a positive upside to our sales as inventory accumulated during the Patache port shiploader repairs are expected to be sold in the second half. 
Production is also expected to be stronger. Collahuasi will have better grade and throughput despite a loss week of production during the recent snowstorm. Los Bronces production will also increase, particularly as the expansion project comes on stream in the fourth quarter, and this will be delivering new volumes at a low cash cost. This also leads to a significant step-up in our copper production for next year as the production -- as the project is up and running. At Collahuasi, all of our expansion projects are progressing well.  
Turning to our Quellaveco project in Peru. The project approval has been delayed compared to the previous guidance, and we're now targeting approval during 2012. We're continuing to work on the project, consulting and working with all levels of government in order to achieve the water permits that we require. And then the dialogue process with the local communities is making very good progress. However, it is still going to take more time to successfully conclude this process."

In this half year, we successfully delivered Barro Alto on time and on budget in local currency terms. This is a major milestone, and we believe this is one of the most successful greenfield nickel project delivered in recent times. There are a few nickel projects able to deliver product to specification. 
Barro Alto has done that from the start. Barro Alto is ramping up well, and we expect to reach full production in the second half of next year. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. And with a cash cost of around $4 per pound, Barro Alto will generate significant cash flows.
De Beers production totaled 15.5 million carats recovered, following strong growth in demand from the Middle East and China retail markets. De Beers sales during the first half were larger than the full year sales in 2009, contributing $450 million of operating profit to Anglo American. 
So building on a strong financial performance in the first half, we fully expect an even stronger second half to this year. With that, I now hand over to Rene to take you through the financials."

Despite operation in China in the first quarter, that Cynthia described, I'm very pleased to report a 41% increase in earnings. So level of earnings of $3.1 billion, that's after an effective tax rate of 31.8%, very much in line with the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year, and we are confirming a 32% tax rate for the full year. 
CapEx of $2.3 billion, we are confirming our guidance for the full year of $6 billion as we are ramping up the project at Minas Rio. In the first 6 months, we spent $300 million at Minas Rio. We are projecting to spend $1.2 billion for the full year. 
Net debt was down $600 million in the first 6 months, down to $6.8 billion. This number includes a net cash position in South Africa of $1.7 billion. 
Over the next slide, I will go through price exchange, volume and cash balances. Let me highlight a couple of things on this slide. 
Operating profit from Coal went up 45%. The level of CPI inflation on the weighted average for the group has picked up to 3.9% in the first 6 months of this year. For last year, the number of the same basis was 3.3%. 
We also highlight on this slide the cash cost variance associated with the safety stoppage at Platinum as well as the rain disruptions that Cynthia described, $250 million negative impact. 
Positive variance from associates must be due to the substantial increase in contribution from De Beers. De Beers contributed $450 million in the first 6 months on the back of 35% increase in rough diamonds.
Turning to traded commodities price variance. You see the increase in platinum price and an increase in their own basket price just above ZAR 20,000 for the first half of this year, an increase of 16% due to the increase in platinum price but even more the increase in palladium price, which on average was at $775 an ounce in the first 6 months, an increase of 68% compared to the similar period last year. 
Copper, on average, realized price of $4.22 compared to $308 in the previous period. At the end of this year -- end of June, sorry, we had 108,000 tons of copper partially priced at $4.28. The volatility due to mark-to-market adjustment will increase following the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion. 
Turning to the bulks commodities and first, Iron Ore. Like the rest of the industry, we have moved to shorter-term prices. Cynthia mentioned the production declined in Kumba. Kumba, in same time, was able to maintain the same level of export sales in excess of 18 million tons in the first 6 months of this year. Kumba has also negotiated with AMSA an extension of the interim pricing agreement for another 12 months up to July 2012 at the branded price of $65 a ton. 
Turning to Coal. Similar situation as the one I've described for Iron Ore with a move to shorter-term prices. In fact, Met Coal was able to outperform the spot price in the second quarter and have also settled for the third quarter for hard coking coal at $315 a ton just like the lower available of the second quarter. 
Thermal Coal. In 2010, we saw the expiration of a 5-year contract with EDF, the French utility, at $67 a ton, which means that now, we are fully exposed to short-term prices in thermal coal.
Exchange and volume variance. We -- like the rest of the industry, we are negatively impacted by the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar, a negative exchange variance of $519, all due to the South African rand and Australian dollar. 
Limited volume variance of $124 million as  especially Kumba and Platinum were able to mitigate the production decline by drawing down on the level finished goods inventory in Kumba and pipeline inventory in Platinum.
Turning to cost of variance. Cynthia described the level of inflationary pressure that we are seeing them of input cost. For the first 6 months, we are reporting 7% above CPI inflation in increased cost. If that -- this number includes the impact of lower production. If you normalize the level of production in the first 6 months, this number is down to 5%, and it's that way that we are projecting for the full year. So 5% above CPI inflation for the full year. 
We had a very strong operating cash flow of $5.2 billion for the first 6 months. That's despite the negative working capital movement of $800 million due to higher prices. You also see the proceed from divestment of $0.5 billion following the completion of the divestment of the 2 zinc assets at the beginning of the year, Black Mountain and Lisheen. 
In terms of mining divestment, we are going through the regulatory approval process for the -- John mentioned, between Tarmac and Lafarge in the U.K., and we are preparing the launch of the divestment of Scaw Metals in South Africa in the second half of this year. 
This table updates $6.8 billion at end of June, exclude the debt in De Beers, which is down to $1.4 billion at end of June compared to $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. 
Cynthia mentioned the increase in the interim dividend at 12%. In terms of capital management, the priorities are first, to fund our organic growth program, and we are expecting the level of CapEx to remain above $6 billion for the next few years. We will continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisition, and any excess cash will be returned to our shareholders. Thank you."

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Our growth profile sets us apart, both in terms of being well spread across our suite of core commodities and across the different time horizons. This is not distant growth. This is growth now. 
Our long-life, low-cost projects are coming onstream in time to benefit from the robust demand and pricing environment. At the current copper price of around $4.40 per pound and nickel of around $11 per pound, we are set to generate very substantial cash flows.

We can claim ownership of the most diversified project pipeline in mining, and we're positioned to take full advantage of development in emerging economies, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. 
I will explain later on the challenges the industry faces from which we are not immune. Notwithstanding, in the past 6 months, significant progress has been made. As you can see, 14 projects have progressed through the next approval stage, and many more have progressed through earlier phases of studies. But there's more to come. In 2011, our spending on exploration and earthly studies were more than double. 
You've heard us talk about first half performance, the challenges we've faced with the solid -- and the solid foundation for growth. Our focus on constantly improving on our cost position is relentless, and the delivery of our big 4 projects will further enhance those positions. 
Since 2005, our resource base has underground -- undergone explosive growth as a result of many exploration successes and acquisitions. We are restocking our pipeline continuously to sustain growth for the long term. 
Take Nickel, for example. We have increased our resource base by more than 9x, and this doesn't include the world-class discovery, Morro Sem Bone, in Brazil. For Iron Ore, our resource base has grown by almost 4x, not least as we have to fund further the resource at Minas Rio, taking it from 1.2 billion tons at the time of acquisition to 5.3 billion tons today. 
We have resources, the infrastructure and the people to deliver, and this places us in a very competitive position. 
Now let me say a few words on the macro environment. In the short term, demand for commodities is likely to be volatile. The sovereign debt crisis in the U.S. and Europe have passed some shadows over the outlook for the demand in the next few years. In addition, growth in the major emerging economies is slowing as policymakers seek to restrain inflation. Still, the longer-term fundamentals for commodity demand remained strong. 
The urbanization of China and the emerging economies will ensure demand for the commodities we produce remains strong for the long term. At present, some 20 million people, almost the population of Australia, are moving to China's cities each year. In China's current 5-year plan, more than 36 million social housing units will be constructed, 10 million this year alone. Urbanization will require significant steel and other raw materials over the next 2 decades. 
China's industrialization and urbanization will provide additional long-term growth and demand for raw materials required for construction of roads and rail to light cities, ports, power transmission networks and heavy industry. And let's not forget, this is not only about China. India and the other emerging economies are following a similar sort of development cycle. 
As development continues in China and emerging economies, the demand growth for the commodities we produce will shift in parallel to the increasing sophistication of these economies. And there's no doubt in my mind we will benefit from this shift. 
Demand growth in emerging economies, however, is only half the price picture. The other half is the inability of supply to keep up with demand growth, and this is caused by a wide variety of factors, such as skill, labor shortages, regulatory delays and infrastructure constraints. 
We see in Australia, for example, permitting times, which 5 years ago, on average, would have taken about 12 months for a project. Now it can take up to about 3 years. And a similar story occurs with poor capacity in Queensland or rail capacity in South Africa or political uncertainty in many resource-rich countries. And coupled with grades declines in existing ore bodies, a picture emerges of supply consistently under delivering against market expectations, and this is unlikely to improve in the short term. 
So to sum up, we have been on a journey to transform Anglo American. We have delivered on commitments made along the way. Today, we've reported on progress on those commitments. You've heard this morning a substantial rise in operating profits, the benefits of asset optimization and supply chain programs and our actions to mitigate cost pressures and move down the cost curve. Above all, you've heard about where we are going as a company. The foundations we have laid to get us there and the delivery of our very substantial production growth. 
We have delivered Barro Alto, a large complex project. Another 3 major projects are on schedule to be delivered into this highly supportive demand environment. An $85 billion, 100-project diversified pipeline will allow us to double or more than double production over the next decade. And this is why I am confident in saying our real growth is still to come, and our eyes remain focused firmly on becoming the leading global mining company. 
So with that, everyone, thank you very much for your attention. And I'd like to take questions, first, from London, a couple of questions and then from South Africa and then on the phone line. Jason?"

First of all, our plans for projects in Peru have not changed. We congratulate President Humala on his electoral victory, and we look forward to working with him. And we remain committed to those 2 copper projects,",469,"Okay. Well, let's start first with Peru. First of all, our plans for projects in Peru have not changed. We congratulate President Humala on his electoral victory, and we look forward to working with him. And we remain committed to those 2 copper projects, Quellaveco and Michiquillay. The feasibility study for Quellaveco has been completed, and as John said, we are awaiting approval of critical water permits. What I would also say to you is we did elect -- as a result of some of the events this year, in particular, with respect to other mining projects, we decided to engage in a dialogue table with the local community, with NGOs and with the regional president in the Quellaveco area. As a result of that, as John mentioned, it has caused a delay. On the other hand, we are unique in terms of what it is that we have done and having that dialogue table, and we've also been engaging with the new Minister and others at the central government level. So the answer to your question is I think we're going about this the right way. I think we have done something very different from what has been done in the past. The regional president is with us all along the way, very committed, and we are also getting the same sort of feedback from the newly elected official. So the outlook, I think, is positive. As I said, we continue to be committed, but we do expect the confirmation on the project to be next year. On the question of South Africa. We have been very clear about our position. Nationalization, first of all, is not the policy of the South African government. Nationalization does not work. Mining makes a massive contribution to the economies of resource-producing countries. And certainly, in the case of South Africa, we constitute -- the industry constitutes 8.6% of South Africa GDP. Anglo American alone is 2.5%. And actually, the largest beneficiaries of South African mining are the employees of the South African government and the suppliers to the mining industry. So Jason, again, we have made ourselves clear on where we are on this. We have gotten consistent readings from the government and expression of an absolute position on this, whether it's from the Minister or the President or the Deputy President, and we continue to believe in South Africa. Now if you turn to our project pipeline, going forward, we are looking at, I mentioned, $85 billion. I've mentioned before $16 billion of near-term projects to be approved. About 50% of that are -- will be in South America. And so, we are very, very diverse in terms of our geographic footprint, and we'll continue to invest heavily, not just in South Africa but in South America. Other questions? Yes."

So is the strategy just to continue to fill your CapEx pipeline like your peer group? Or can Anglo also be a free cash flow story with higher dividends to run alongside your higher production base? And then secondly, on Platinum, I. Know you're talking about higher production in the second half, but do you really think that's enough to offset the cost inflation that we're seeing in the region at the moment?"

First question on our strategy, looking forward and whether it's all about projects I think is what you're asking and whether the cash flows will be going directly in the projects or feeding back into the market. I think that we -- as I've said, we'",508,"Okay. First question on our strategy, looking forward and whether it's all about projects I think is what you're asking and whether the cash flows will be going directly in the projects or feeding back into the market. I think that we -- as I've said, we've got a massive project pipeline. Thank heavens we didn't stop the spend a few years ago with many of our peers did stop the spend. We will continue to invest going forward. We're reaping the benefits from those 4 projects. We're going to be seeing in the EBITDA, a contribution, over the next few years, at today's prices of more than $6 billion. Next year, we're looking at a CapEx -- this year, as Rene said, it's about $6 billion. Next year, it will be about $6.5 billion, the year after, similar sort of run rate. And as we go forward and as we look at the dynamics of the markets and how we're positioned, how we're performing operationally, how those projects are coming onstream, we will make a determination as to how much -- to what extent we will increase those dividends. So we have a progressive dividend policy that is either to maintain or increase, and it's really on that basis. It's on that basis as to whether we are going to -- which options we're going to pursue, and actually, we can pursue many of them at the same time. The second question is about Platinum. Will higher production offset the cost inflation? Clearly, cost inflation has been a big, big challenge in South Africa. You're aware that labor rates have -- labor costs have increased by about 9% this year. Electricity is up by about 26%, in line with the last couple of years. I think Neville and the group in Platinum have actually done a phenomenal job in containing cost in nominal terms over the last 3 years. I mean, we've done that 2008, 2009, 2010 between ZAR 11,000, ZAR 12,000, and our target is to get it to ZAR 12,000 per ounce for the rest of the year. We know that is a challenge. So higher production will help, but that's not all that's needed. We need to also increase productivities. We need to capture more out of procurements. We need to think even more about the structure of the organization. Neville's done a phenomenal job of restructuring and driving efficiencies, but there's still more that we can do, as for the optimization last year plus procurement yielded about $700 million of value. And he's got even more plans to do greater amounts of that going forward. So it's really across the business. Neville, you want to just comment anymore. And were quick Neville is happy with that. Okay. Neville was happy with that. All right. I'll take just one question from you and then we'll go to South Africa. And then -- and I'll try to share these questions with my colleagues who are in this room, because you got a great group here."

In terms of where we are, at present, there are no particular bottlenecks that we don't believe that we believe that we can't overcome. And as I said earlier, we have started on the civil works at the beneficiation plant and the tailings dam. There are a number of licenses and permits that we still need. We've gotten secured, since we started, 38 critical licenses. We have 11 yet to secure. In terms of the land assets, we have 87% of the land access along the pipeline now secured. We have -- on Spread 3, which is all in the state of Rio, we have about 99% there virtually complete, 87% on Spread 2 and 65% on Spread 1, so I would say making very, very good progress. I'd be happy to sit with you and kind of give you the details. I have a lot of details on this. I can also say that we are -- I mean, you have everybody in this executive team is right behind Ministry to do everything to support. We continue to drill the resource. I've stated -- I notified you that we identified or confirmed 5.3 billion tons. It's going to be quite a bit more than that, and I'll come back and give you an update at the year end performance. In terms of CapEx, it's still $5 billion. So we haven't changed that, and we spent $1.9 billion to date. So again, to us, anybody else would be happy with lots and lots and lots of detail. The port is actually ahead of schedule by about 1.5 months, and port construction is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. And we've got -- as I said, civil works, about 15% of that has been now completed. So that's not too bad. On the earthwork side around the beneficiation plant, about 73% is complete. So a lot of bits, a lot of pieces to this story. But I think that, certainly, we are pretty confident that this is going to be a great cash generator. We believe that the cash cost will be on the very low end of the cost curve. We think the quality of this resource is very, very high. It is absolutely a Tier 1 resource. You've heard us talk about the tariff that we've locked in for the long term at about $5.15 per ton. I mean, that's phenomenal in today's environment. So I think it's looking pretty good, but that's not to say we don't have our challenges. And I've said to you all before, I cannot guarantee anything. I mean, a lot of this is out of our control, but we got hundreds of people on the ground working day in, day out to access the permits and the licenses. Thank you very much for the question. Okay.

And with this extensive and significant growth profile that you have, I wonder if we could speak about a project such as, for example, New Largo, how you think about New Largo, which we see is up for approval late in 2012. And clearly going as a captive mine to, we wonder if we could just think about how Anglo thinks about that in internal relation to returns. And then my last and third question, please. I noticed that, clearly, Catalao, Copebras and Peace River have reappeared as coal operations. And I just wonder if you could speak about whether those are going to be integrated into the big -- into the divisions, where they'd be integrated. I noticed that Catalao is on the growth profile. It's on the project pipeline, which I think, if I look back quite a long time, I haven't seen Catalao as a growth project at Anglo for a long time.

Again, as I've said a little bit early of the progressive dividend policy, we -- and that means that we -- it's either maintained -- our dividends are either maintained off of a base or increased through the cycle. And you would be aware that obviously we made an increase at the tail end of last year with the base annual dividend per share of $0.65 per share that we reestablished in 2010. So perhaps I'll leave it at that. In terms of the project hurdles, I'm not sure that New Largo is exactly the one that we want to pick out. I would just say, generally -- and then Norman, maybe I'll ask you to comment on some of the challenges maybe in South Africa, because you've got -- you've actually what brought onstream Mafube, that is adding a really good value, fully operational. You're right in the process of bringing on Zibulo. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. But clearly, on the projects execution and delivery side, there are hurdles, starting first with labor shortages and starting first in Australia. I mean, we're-- you would be very well aware of those challenges there. Now what are we doing about it? We are not waiting for those projects to even be confirmed. We are preparing for those projects now. So in the case of Grosvenor macro project in Australia, again, we don't expect confirmation until the first quarter of next year. On the other hand, we're looking at our needs from a critical resource standpoint and capacity standpoint, from a young talent standpoint, from a particular functional standpoint. So whether we're looking for engineers or geologists or miners, we are preparing and understanding, person-by-person, man-by-man, what our needs are for the next number of years, for the next 5 years. And it's an extremely helpful process. It is multifaceted, multilayered. And Seamus and the team are going to places like Canada, Germany, the United States to start recruiting for those projects for years to come. So that's one answer to how we're dealing with some of this. Now Norman, I'd like you to stand up and just comment on the question about how you bring projects online in South Africa, because I think you've got some very, very good examples."

Your question about Copebras, Catalao and Peace River coal, maybe I can just touch on Peace River coal for a minute. So why did we retain this? We -- Seamus and the team from Australia have spent quite a bit of time on the ground. We think that it's all metallurgical coal.  We're only producing about 1 million tons, not even that, this year, but we think there is more potential. And it's about sharing expertise. It's about applying best practices and doing things differently. So we think this resource does have the potential to increase production substantially. We haven't yet defined exactly to what extent, but I will say substantially. And so that is now part of Seamus' group. In terms of Copebras and Catalao, these businesses will be managed as core businesses within Anglo American, and we're just now determining exactly under which individual. But we believe that their quality -- they're assets, in the case of Copebras, given where the phosphate business is today, the margins that we're reaping, we are looking at and assessing how this business is likely to evolve. So that's really where it is. Catalao, we've identified a lot more resources and niobium in Brazil there, substantially more. And we're looking at seeing how we can actually expand that operation.

So I -- we're working on how that's going to flow through to the bottom line and when. We haven't yet taken a decision on how we're going to share that with the market, and we'll probably do that either at the year end results. In terms of the question on outlook, Heath, we actually have increased the prices on all the long-term prices for our commodities. So with every single one, we've made those increases. And we think, actually, for every one of our commodities, the growth actually looks very, very strong. I mean, we've got average growth on the Platinum side of 3% to 4%. We think that the market is pretty much in balance right now. Copper, obviously -- it has a -- we expect a significant deficit this year of around 500,000 tons at least. We -- and longer-term demand in the neighborhood of about 3% to 4%. China representing, in the near term, about 7%. I think in terms of Iron Ore and Met Coal, Met Coal has come up by 8% year-on-year thus far. And the outlook is -- continues to be very, very strong. We're seeing steel production, obviously, come up significantly in -- starting first in China but across the world, including Europe and the U.S. So I would say, overall, we are -- despite that volatility and despite that nervousness, we think that the consumption of our commodities, all of our commodities, will be very strong, both in the near, medium and the long term. And obviously, I did also mention, on the Platinum side, we think that there's a lot of upside given that at the Platinum, we'll be coming on even more strongly out into the future. So growth there -- I mean, we saw a growth this year, thus far, of the market in Platinum of about 7%. On the autocatalyst side, it was up by over 50%. I mean, it's just fantastic. And again, we'll come back and talk to you more about our Platinum outlook. I know Neville will, but we think there's a lot of upside in the market there. Thank you, Heath.

Yes, I have to say I am a little tired of the question, but I'm not surprised that you continue to ask the question. So with respect to Platinum, let me just back up a little bit and then put it in perspective from where we sit. Our #1 objective is to deliver shareholder value across all of our businesses. That -- let's be clear about that. And this means that we continuously review the entire Anglo American portfolio of businesses and are positioned in that portfolio. This includes the ownership of Anglo American Platinum. However, our strategy remains clear, and we focus on commodities that we believe will deliver the best return to the economic cycle. And with those commodities, we focus on Tier 1 assets that have large scale, long life, have low cost profiles and offer clear expansion potential. And we remain committed to maximizing the value of these synergies while reviewing the portfolio structure. We believe PGMs are highly attractive, and they have fantastic long-term fundamentals. PGMs provide material exposure to late cycle development of the emerging countries and a shift towards carbon reduction technology. And our Platinum assets represent one, if not the best Tier 1 resource position in the world. I think in terms of the -- our intervention and our involvement in the Platinum business, I don't think there can be a question about that. We have made significant impact and improvements over the years with Neville and the team to achieve best practice to Anglo American standard and applying expertise both within the Platinum business but also from Anglo American. We've improved the safety performance. Fatalitites are down by almost 70% since 2007. Headcount has been reduced by about 30,000. We've had flat cost for 3 years running. We've got another challenge this year. Productivity has increased hugely, and we are benefiting from the Platinum business as they are benefiting from us. I think the group structure is highly effective with -- the businesses are benefiting from the synergies of Anglo American's global scale and broader financial and technical resources. And I think this clearly demonstrates -- it has been demonstrated through the economic benefits delivered year-to-date through asset optimizations, as an example, of about $300 million or procurement of $100 million. And let me put this into context. Platinum's assets are the equivalent of the cover of the Pilbara of Iron Ore, but they're not carved up or co-owned by Rio Tinto or BHP or FMG. And then the Bowen Basin of Met Coal, BHB Billiton has 50% of BMA. So we think that these are great assets. We think that we're adding substantial value. We think that they're adding value to us. And given the market outlook of Platinum and PGMs in general, we think that the returns of this business will be that much more attractive and add that much more to Anglo American going forward. Okay, with that, everybody -- oh, sorry, David. Question about Finland. We do have a lot of work going on in Northern Finland. I can't share it with you as much as I would like to today, but we will come back at the year end results, we believe -- Brian, where are you -- when we have confirmed the resource and the makeup of that resource and give you the specifics around it.
So with that everybody, I thank you again for your attention. I thank you for yours in South Africa and for those on the phone. We certainly appreciate your support. We appreciate your interest. We appreciate the time that you've spent with us today. Thank you very much."

I'll start by giving you the highlights of what has been a strong first half to the year despite escalating cost impacts. Then I'll demonstrate how we transformed and positioned ourselves over the last 4 years to face challenges no matter where we were in the cycle. And we'll also look at the operational performances of the business. Rene will take you through the financials, and I'll outline our growth profile and how our new production will improve further our cost positions. And finally, I'll say a few words about how we see the long-term picture.
So firstly, I'd like to remind you of the journey that we've been on with our strategy, embedding a culture that focuses on business excellence. We are investing in the commodities we believe have the most attractive fundamentals. We have a well-diversified portfolio of attractive commodities with exposure to the full cycle of the development of emerging countries. We now have a performance mindset in safety, productivity, cost containment and project delivery. Our focus has been on people and driving performance with everyone getting involved. So the highlights.
Our strong financial performance in the first half is reflective of the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. These have enabled us to capture the maximum benefit from increased commodity prices. 
The terrible tragedy in Japan has shown the world the extraordinary resilience of the Japanese people, and this was also evident in our customers who recovered strongly following the disasters. Our close relationships with customers enabled us to redirect shipments at very short notice. And this ensured demand was satisfied at the right place and at the right time. 
Total group operating profit is $6 billion, up 38%. Operating profit from our core businesses was up 45%. Our underlying earnings are $3.1 billion, with earnings per share at $2.58, a 40% increase. All our core business units recorded higher operating profits. 
Asset optimization and supply chain programs have delivered a combined $1.3 billion of value in the first 6 months of the year. This is how we maximize margin, by capturing the full benefit of strong prices and minimizing the impact of those events beyond our control, be it weather, be it cost inflation or infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front. Our decision in 2009 to sustain investment on our big 4 projects will pay off as we generate substantial cash flows. So the successful delivery of Barro Alto is only just the start. 
Our other major -- 3 major projects are coming along extremely well. We're now in a position to take full advantage of robust demand as we deliver some of the lowest capital intensity and operating cost volumes to attractive markets. And in addition, we have another $66 billion worth of growth projects awaiting approval. 
It's a very strong picture. And I'm therefore pleased to announce we have raised our interim dividend by 12% to $0.28 per share.
Before we turn to the operating performance, I'd like to talk for a few minutes about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. Over the past 5 years, we have had sustained safety improvement, and I'm therefore extremely disappointed and deeply saddened to report that 10 of our employees lost their lives in work-related incidents in the first half of the year. 
Having said this, it is important to note 93% of our operations had no fatalities, and a number of our individual mines have achieved exceptional performance, including the Modikwa mine in Platinum achieving -- recently achieving a South African industry record of 8 million fatality-free shifts. The new Kolomela mine in South Africa has recently achieved 13 million lost time injury free man hours. 
And no matter what the record though, 10 deaths are 10 too many, and there's no ifs and there's no buts. Every man and woman working on our sites has a right to return home safely. So let me assure you we are relentless in driving towards 0 harm.
Looking at the first half of 2011. We see a story of 2 quarters: the first marked by severe weather and the second all about recovery. We acted fast as a an aligned group. We put in place recovery plans and we achieved a swift turnaround, and I expect this momentum to continue as we move through the second half of the year.
Turning to input costs. We are not immune to the pressures industry is facing. Prices for some key input commodities have escalated dramatically. As you can see from the chart, market sulfuric prices -- sulfuric acid prices are up 60%. Oil is up 27%. And this is in addition to the higher salary demand in Chile, in South Africa and Australia. And Rene will take you through how this has impacted our cost position, but we have mitigated some of the impacts through our supply chain and asset optimization programs.
Looking at our global supply chain. We are delivering real benefit to the bottom line. The rate of increase in the prices of our key inputs is much lower than wider market escalation. And whether its large off-road tires or dump trucks. Price, however, is only part of the picture. 
Solid partnerships with critical suppliers ensure we can secure supply for existing operations and future projects. We're also working closely with our suppliers to identify the best ways of achieving greater tire longevity and fuel efficiency for our vehicles.
Asset optimization continues to exceed expectations. And having delivered on our 2011 target a year early, we believe that there is more value to be unlocked here. We are confident we have gained momentum in embedding operational excellence across the group. And this year, we intend to complete 7 operation reviews. Five reviews were completed last year, and we've identified up to $400 million of potential savings out of that. 
At our Australian Coal business, for example, we are already leading the industry in open cut mine productivity. We apply the same approach to our underground mines. The Longwall 100 Program, launched less than a year ago, exceeded its target of 100 cutting hours in just 6 months, which led to a production record in the month of June.
Now let's look at the businesses. And I'm going to take you through Iron Ore, Nickel, Thermal Coal and Diamonds and ask John Mackenzie, Neville and Seamus to talk about their businesses. 
Starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Operating profit was $2.5 billion, up 54%. And despite heavy rains, Kumba delivered 22 million tons of product sales, and we expect Kumba to recover their production shortfall by the end of the year. 
In Brazil, Amapa is a turnaround story. In the first half of last year, Amapa recorded a loss of $7 million. In the first half of this year, we've recorded a gain of $45 million. 
As you all know, we have 2 major Iron Ore projects under construction. Kolomela is 94% complete. The plan has been handed over for coal commissioning. Hot commissioning is expected to start in the third quarter, with the first ore fed through the system this year. And as you are aware, the Minas Rio project faces many regulatory challenges. Nevertheless, we continue to make progress. Civil works for the beneficiation plant and the tailing dam have been underway since March.
A strong result also for Thermal Coal driven by higher export prices and stable production can be seen here. And as many of our other operations, Cerrejon had a big increase in rain stoppages. So it was great that we ended the half year with production down just 3%. We've made good progress on our projects. Zibulo is ramping up substantially, and the Cerrejon expansive project is set for shareholders' approval in the third quarter. 
I'll now invite Seamus to come up and talk about Met Coal."

Metallurgic Coal's operating profit of $491 million was an increase of 87% on the prior year and was an outstanding result given the challenges we faced early in the year with disastrous floods and one of the largest cyclones to hit Queensland on record.  The first half profit was, in fact, a record H1 profit for the business. 
On prices, our positive working relationship with customers, early engagement allowed the business to effectively manage the flood impact on our customers and to lead the market in settling quarterly pricing. The benchmark price of $330 a ton that we set in quarter 2 is in fact a record hard coking coal price.
Production was severely impacted by these flood events, particularly in quarter 1, and a production recovery plan was put into place. The actions allowed us to recover in quarter 2 at a faster rate than our competitors, allowing us to fully capitalize on the record prices that we had set. 
As a result of this work, production is expected to increase in the second half of the year as operations return to normalized levels in June and this build on the momentum of the second quarter, which was itself a 77% production increase over the first quarter. 
We are expecting a heavy wet season starting again in quarter 4. And to minimize future rain impacts, we put together a comprehensive program at our open cut sites that includes coating haulage road surfaces, drainage buns to reduce pit water ingress and doubling up pit pumping capacity.
Looking forward, near-term production will be driven by asset optimization initiatives over the next 3 years and of course, delivery of the first stage of the Grosvenor project from 2016. And we expect approval for that project in the next 12 months as we have said previously. 
We should note, however, that the carbon prices scheme proposed by the Australian government does pose a risk to planned future investments in Australia. Mining projects in Australia will face the full impact of the carbon price from day one of production with no transitional assistance. And this will, of course -- will divert resources and funding that could otherwise be engaged in abatement technology. 
We have been proactive in engaging with the government to modify the scheme, and we will continue to work with the government to put forward a better way of pricing carbon that won't impact on these planned investments in Australia. Cynthia?"

Refined platinum volume increased by 17% to 1.17 million ounces, allowing for increased sales year-on-year. Our refined platinum production and sales guidance of 2.6 million ounces remains unchanged as we expect a better performance in the second half of the year. 
Reduction in the first half of the year was badly affected by extraordinary safety stoppages, breaks due to public holidays and long weekends and some operational issues. These production issues were mitigated with increases in production from Mogalakwena, Unki, our tail-ends retreatment, sweeping and sifted material. Mogalakwena, the open-pit mine, continues to perform strongly and provides Anglo American Platinum with a flexible production source. 
As we improve production, our cost and efficiency will get back to the -- back on track in the second half of this year. Our unit cost will get back down to the ZAR 12,000 per ounce level. And similarly, our productivity will increase to the 7.3 square meters per person for the second half."

Whilst copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the first half was a record. 
Our copper production for the first half was down 8% on the prior year, primarily as a result of 2 key reasons: firstly, severe rain disruptions at Collahuasi is a result of rainfall that is 4 to 5x the annual average, which is -- came down in the first 3 months of the year; and then secondly, the anticipated grade decline at Los Bronces. Some of this was offset by a significant increase in throughput at Los Bronces following a series of initiatives to increase our throughput in the SAG mill, which is the bottleneck for our production process. 
As you've heard from Cynthia, we're facing the same broad pressures in costs and also, a weaker U.S. dollar in Chile. Having said that, we do expect a stronger performance in the second half. There's a positive upside to our sales as inventory accumulated during the Patache port shiploader repairs are expected to be sold in the second half. 
Production is also expected to be stronger. Collahuasi will have better grade and throughput despite a loss week of production during the recent snowstorm. Los Bronces production will also increase, particularly as the expansion project comes on stream in the fourth quarter, and this will be delivering new volumes at a low cash cost. This also leads to a significant step-up in our copper production for next year as the production -- as the project is up and running. At Collahuasi, all of our expansion projects are progressing well.  
Turning to our Quellaveco project in Peru. The project approval has been delayed compared to the previous guidance, and we're now targeting approval during 2012. We're continuing to work on the project, consulting and working with all levels of government in order to achieve the water permits that we require. And then the dialogue process with the local communities is making very good progress. However, it is still going to take more time to successfully conclude this process."

Sales from Codemin and Loma de Niquel were up 21% at a time of strong nickel pricing. 
In this half year, we successfully delivered Barro Alto on time and on budget in local currency terms. This is a major milestone, and we believe this is one of the most successful greenfield nickel project delivered in recent times. There are a few nickel projects able to deliver product to specification. 
Barro Alto has done that from the start. Barro Alto is ramping up well, and we expect to reach full production in the second half of next year. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. And with a cash cost of around $4 per pound, Barro Alto will generate significant cash flows.
De Beers production totaled 15.5 million carats recovered, following strong growth in demand from the Middle East and China retail markets. De Beers sales during the first half were larger than the full year sales in 2009, contributing $450 million of operating profit to Anglo American. 
So building on a strong financial performance in the first half, we fully expect an even stronger second half to this year. With that, I now hand over to Rene to take you through the financials."

Despite operational challenge in the first quarter, that Cynthia described, I'm very pleased to report a 41% increase in earnings. So level of earnings of $3.1 billion, that's after an effective tax rate of 31.8%, very much in line with the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year, and we are confirming a 32% tax rate for the full year. 
CapEx of $2.3 billion, we are confirming our guidance for the full year of $6 billion as we are ramping up the project at Minas Rio. In the first 6 months, we spent $300 million at Minas Rio. We are projecting to spend $1.2 billion for the full year. 
Net debt was down $600 million in the first 6 months, down to $6.8 billion. This number includes a net cash position in South Africa of $1.7 billion. 
Over the next slide, I will go through price exchange, volume and cash balances. Let me highlight a couple of things on this slide. 
Operating profit from Coal operation went up 45%. The level of CPI inflation on the weighted average for the group has picked up to 3.9% in the first 6 months of this year. For last year, the number of the same basis was 3.3%. 
We also highlight on this slide the cash cost variance associated with the safety stoppage at Platinum as well as the rain disruptions that Cynthia described, $250 million negative impact. 
Positive variance from associates must be due to the substantial increase in contribution from De Beers. De Beers contributed $450 million in the first 6 months on the back of 35% increase in rough diamonds.
Turning to traded commodities price variance. You see the increase in platinum price and an increase in the rand basket price just above ZAR 20,000 for the first half of this year, an increase of 16% due to the increase in platinum price but even more the increase in palladium price, which on average was at $775 an ounce in the first 6 months, an increase of 68% compared to the similar period last year. 
Copper, on average, realized price of $4.22 compared to 308 in the previous period. At the end of this year -- end of June, sorry, we had 108,000 tons of copper partially [ph]  Priced at $4.28. The volatility due to mark-to-market adjustment will increase following the commissioning of the Los Bronces expansion. 
Turning to the bulks commodities and first, Iron Ore. Like the rest of the industry, we have moved to shorter-term prices. Cynthia mentioned the production decline in Kumba. Kumba, in same time, was able to maintain the same level of export sales in excess of 18 million tons in the first 6 months of this year. Kumba has also negotiated with AMSA an extension of the interim pricing agreement for another 12 months up to July 2012 at the branded [ph]  Price of $65 a ton. 
Turning to Coal. Similar situation as the one I've described for Iron Ore with a move to shorter-term prices. In fact, Met Coal was able to outperform the spot price in the second quarter and have also settled for the third quarter for hard coking coal at $315 a ton just like the lower available of the second quarter. 
Thermal Coal. In 2010, we saw the expiration of a 5-year contract with EDF, the French utility, at $67 a ton, which means that now, we are fully exposed to short-term prices in thermal coal.
Exchange and volume variance. We -- like the rest of the industry, we are negatively impacted by the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar, a negative exchange variance of $519, all due to the South African rand and Australian dollar. 
Limited volume variance of $124 million as  especially Kumba and Platinum were able to mitigate the production decline by drawing down on the level finished goods inventory in Kumba and pipeline inventory in Platinum.
Turning to cost variance. Cynthia described the level of inflationary pressure that we are seeing them of input cost. For the first 6 months, we are reporting 7% above CPI inflation in increased cost. If that -- this number includes the impact of lower production. If you normalize the level of production in the first 6 months, this number is down to 5%, and that's what we are projecting for the full year. So 5% above CPI inflation for the full year. 
We had a very strong operating cash flow of $5.2 billion for the first 6 months. That's despite the negative working capital movement of $800 million due to higher prices. You also see the proceed from divestment of $0.5 billion following the completion of the divestment of the 2 zinc assets at the beginning of the year, Black Mountain and Lisheen. 
In terms of mining [ph]  Divestment, we are going through the regulatory approval process for the -- John mentioned, between Tarmac and Lafarge in the U.K., and we are preparing the launch of the divestment of Scaw Metals in South Africa in the second half of this year. 
This table updates $6.8 billion at end of June, exclude the debt in De Beers, which is down to $1.4 billion at end of June compared to $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. 
Cynthia mentioned the increase in the interim dividend at 12%. In terms of capital management, the priorities are first, to fund our organic growth program, and we are expecting the level of CapEx to remain above $6 billion for the next few years. We will continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisition, and any excess cash will be returned to our shareholders. Thank you."

We have the skills and the structure to successfully execute large scale, very complex projects. 
Our big 4 projects are all on track. Barro Alto is in production. Los Bronces is close behind. Kolomela is being commissioned, and Minas Rio is also on track. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Our growth profile sets us apart, both in terms of being well spread across our suite of core commodities and across the different time horizons. This is not distant growth. This is growth now. 
Our long-life, low-cost projects are coming onstream in time to benefit from the robust demand and pricing environment. At the current copper price of around $4.40 per pound and nickel of around $11 per pound, we are set to generate very substantial cash flows. 
We have the potential to double production over the next decade with the delivery of an $85 billion pipeline covering more than 100 projects. And this is up from $70 billion I mentioned previously. This reflects the progress we have been making in moving our projects through the pipeline. And you can see the potential for growth from our world-class project pipeline that spans the breadth of commodities attracting the greatest value. 
We invest in those commodities with the strongest fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles and that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders. We can claim ownership of the most diversified project pipeline in mining, and we're positioned to take full advantage of development in emerging economies, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. 
I will explain later on the challenges the industry faces from which we are not immune. Notwithstanding, in the past 6 months, significant progress has been made. As you can see, 14 projects have progressed through the next approval stage, and many more have progressed through earlier phases of studies. But there's more to come. In 2011, our spending on exploration and earthly [ph] studies will more than double. 
You've heard us talk about first half performance, the challenges we've faced with the solid -- and the solid foundation for growth. Our focus on constantly improving on our cost position is relentless, and the delivery of our big 4 projects will further enhance those positions. 
Since 2005, our resource base has underground -- undergone explosive growth as a result of many exploration successes and acquisitions. We are restocking our pipeline continuously to sustain growth for the long term. 
Take Nickel, for example. We have increased our resource base by more than 9x, and this doesn't include the world-class discovery, Morro Sem Bone, in Brazil. For Iron Ore, our resource base has grown by almost 4x, not least as we have to fund further the resource at Minas Rio, taking it from 1.2 billion tons at the time of acquisition to 5.3 billion tons today. 
We have resources, the infrastructure and the people to deliver, and this places us in a very competitive position. 
Now let me say a few words on the macro environment. In the short term, demand for commodities is likely to be volatile. The sovereign debt crisis in the U.S. and Europe have cast some shadows over the outlook for the demand in the next few years. In addition, growth in the major emerging economies is slowing as policymakers seek to restrain inflation. Still, the longer-term fundamentals for commodity demand remain strong. 
The urbanization of China and the emerging economies will ensure demand for the commodities we produce remains strong for the long term. At present, some 20 million people, almost the population of Australia, are moving to China's cities each year. In China's current 5-year plan, more than 36 million social housing units will be constructed, 10 million this year alone. Urbanization will require significant steel and other raw materials over the next 2 decades. 
China's industrialization and urbanization will provide additional long-term growth and demand for raw materials required for construction of roads and rail to light cities, ports, power transmission networks and heavy industry. And let's not forget, this is not only about China. India and the other emerging economies are following a similar sort of development cycle. 
As development continues in China and emerging economies, the demand growth for the commodities we produce will shift in parallel to the increasing sophistication of these economies. And there's no doubt in my mind we will benefit from this shift. 
Demand growth in emerging economies, however, is only half the price picture. The other half is the inability of supply to keep up with demand growth, and this is caused by a wide variety of factors, such as skill, labor shortages, regulatory delays and infrastructure constraints. 
We see in Australia, for example, permitting times, which 5 years ago, on average, would have taken about 12 months for a project. Now it can take up to about 3 years. And a similar story occurs with poor capacity in Queensland or rail capacity in South Africa or political uncertainty in many resource-rich countries. And coupled with grades declines in existing ore bodies, a picture emerges of supply consistently under delivering against market expectations, and this is unlikely to improve in the short term. 
So to sum up, we have been on a journey to transform Anglo American. We have delivered on commitments made along the way. Today, we've reported on progress on those commitments. You've heard this morning a substantial rise in operating profits, the benefits of asset optimization and supply chain programs and our actions to mitigate cost pressures and move down the cost curve. Above all, you've heard about where we are going as a company. The foundations we have laid to get us there and the delivery of our very substantial production growth. 
We have delivered Barro Alto, a large complex project. Another 3 major projects are on schedule to be delivered into this highly supportive demand environment. An $85 billion, 100-project diversified pipeline will allow us to double or more than double production over the next decade. And this is why I am confident in saying our real growth is still to come, and our eyes remain focused firmly on becoming the leading global mining company. 
So with that, everyone, thank you very much for your attention. And I'd like to take questions, first, from London, a couple of questions and then from South Africa and then on the phone line. Jason?"

First of all, our plans for projects in Peru have not changed. We congratulate President Humala on his electoral victory, and we look forward to working with him. And we remain committed to those 2 copper projects,",469,"Okay. Well, let's start first with Peru. First of all, our plans for projects in Peru have not changed. We congratulate President Humala on his electoral victory, and we look forward to working with him. And we remain committed to those 2 copper projects, Quellaveco and Michiquillay. The feasibility study for Quellaveco has been completed, and as John said, we are awaiting approval of critical water permits. What I would also say to you is we did elect -- as a result of some of the events this year, in particular, with respect to other mining projects, we decided to engage in a dialogue table with the local community, with NGOs and with the regional president in the Quellaveco area. As a result of that, as John mentioned, it has caused a delay. On the other hand, we are unique in terms of what it is that we have done and having that dialogue table, and we've also been engaging with the new Minister and others at the central government level. So the answer to your question is I think we're going about this the right way. I think we have done something very different from what has been done in the past. The regional president is with us all along the way, very committed, and we are also getting the same sort of feedback from the newly elected official. So the outlook, I think, is positive. As I said, we continue to be committed, but we do expect the confirmation on the project to be next year. On the question of South Africa. We have been very clear about our position. Nationalization, first of all, is not the policy of the South African government. Nationalization does not work. Mining makes a massive contribution to the economies of resource-producing countries. And certainly, in the case of South Africa, we constitute -- the industry constitutes 8.6% of South Africa GDP. Anglo American alone is 2.5%. And actually, the largest beneficiaries of South African mining are the employees of the South African government and the suppliers to the mining industry. So Jason, again, we have made ourselves clear on where we are on this. We have gotten consistent readings from the government and expression of an absolute position on this, whether it's from the Minister or the President or the Deputy President, and we continue to believe in South Africa. Now if you turn to our project pipeline, going forward, we are looking at, I mentioned, $85 billion. I've mentioned before $16 billion of near-term projects to be approved. About 50% of that are -- will be in South America. And so, we are very, very diverse in terms of our geographic footprint, and we'll continue to invest heavily, not just in South Africa but in South America. Other questions? Yes."

Just on the strategy side, if we look forward 6 months, I think 3 of your major growth projects will be in production. So is the strategy just to continue to fill your CapEx pipeline like your peer group? Or can Anglo also be a free cash flow story with higher dividends to run alongside your higher production base? And then secondly, on Platinum. I know you're talking about higher production in the second half, but do you really think that's enough to offset the cost inflation that we're seeing in the region at the moment?"

First question on our strategy, looking forward and whether it's all about projects I think is what you're asking and whether the cash flows will be going directly in the projects or feeding back into the market. I think that we -- as I've said, we'",500,"Okay. First question on our strategy, looking forward and whether it's all about projects I think is what you're asking and whether the cash flows will be going directly in the projects or feeding back into the market. I think that we -- as I've said, we've got a massive project pipeline. Thank heavens we didn't stop the spend a few years ago with many of our peers did stop the spend. We will continue to invest going forward. We're reaping the benefits from those 4 projects. We're going to be seeing in the EBITDA, a contribution, over the next few years, at today's prices of more than $6 billion. Next year, we're looking at a CapEx -- this year, as Rene said, it's about $6 billion. Next year, it will be about $6.5 billion, the year after, similar sort of run rate. And as we go forward and as we look at the dynamics of the markets and how we're positioned, how we're performing operationally, how those projects are coming onstream, we will make a determination as to how much -- to what extent we will increase those dividends. So we have a progressive dividend policy that is either to maintain or increase, and it's really on that basis. It's on that basis as to whether we are going to -- which options we're going to pursue, and actually, we can pursue many of them at the same time. The second question is about Platinum. Will higher production offset the cost inflation? Clearly, cost inflation has been a big, big challenge in South Africa. You're aware that labor rates have -- labor costs have increased by about 9% this year. Electricity is up by about 26%, in line with the last couple of years. I think Neville and the group in Platinum have actually done a phenomenal job in containing cost in nominal terms over the last 3 years. I mean, we've done that 2008, 2009, 2010 between ZAR 11,000, ZAR 12,000, and our target is to get it to ZAR 12,000 per ounce for the rest of the year. We know that is a challenge. So higher production will help, but that's not all that's needed. We need to also increase productivities. We need to capture more out of procurements. We need to think even more about the structure of the organization. Neville's done a phenomenal job of restructuring and driving efficiencies, but there's still more that we can do, as for the optimization last year plus procurement yielded about $700 million of value. And he's got even more plans to do greater amounts of that going forward. So it's really across the business. Neville, you want to just comment anymore. Okay. Neville is happy with that. All right. I'll take just one question from you and then we'll go to South Africa. And then -- and I'll try to share these questions with my colleagues who are in this room, because you got a great group here."

In terms of where we are, at present, there are no particular bottlenecks that we don't believe that we believe that we can't overcome. And as I said earlier, we have started on the civil works at the beneficiation plant and the tailings dam. There are a number of licenses and permits that we still need. We've gotten secured, since we started, 38 critical licenses. We have 11 yet to secure. In terms of the land assets, we have 87% of the land access along the pipeline now secured. We have -- on Spread 3, which is all in the state of Rio, we have about 99% there virtually complete, 87% on Spread 2 and 65% on Spread 1, so I would say making very, very good progress. I'd be happy to sit with you and kind of give you the details. I have a lot of details on this. I can also say that we are -- I mean, you have everybody in this executive team is right behind Ministry on trying to do everything to support. We continue to drill the resource. I've stated -- I notified you that we identified or confirmed 5.3 billion tons. It's going to be quite a bit more than that, and I'll come back and give you an update at the year end performance. In terms of CapEx, it's still $5 billion. So we haven't changed that, and we spent $1.9 billion to date. So again, does, anybody else, would be happy, we have lots and lots and lots of detail. The port is actually ahead of schedule by about 1.5 months, and port construction is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. And we've got -- as I said, civil works, about 15% of that has been now completed. So that's not too bad. On the earthwork side around the beneficiation plant, about 73% is complete. So a lot of bits, a lot of pieces to this story. But I think that, certainly, we are pretty confident that this is going to be a great cash generator. We believe that the cash cost will be on the very low end of the cost curve. We think the quality of this resource is very, very high. It is absolutely a Tier 1 resource. You've heard us talk about the tariff that we've locked in for the long term at about $5.15 per ton. I mean, that's phenomenal in today's environment. So I think it's looking pretty good, but that's not to say we don't have our challenges. And I've said to you all before, I cannot guarantee anything. I mean, a lot of this is out of our control, but we got hundreds of people on the ground working day in, day out to access the permits and the licenses. Thank you very much. Good question. Okay. I need to go to South Africa. So South Africa?"

Or how do you think about that dividend policy from here forward? And secondly, I wonder if we could speak a little bit about project hurdles. And with this extensive and significant growth profile that you have, I wonder if we could speak about a project such as, for example, New Largo, how you think about New Largo, which we see is up for approval late in 2012. And clearly going as a captive mine to Eskom, we wonder if we could just think about how Anglo thinks about that in relation to returns. And then my last and third question, please. I noticed that, clearly, Catalao, Copebras and Peace River have reappeared as core operations. And I just wonder if you could speak about whether those are going to be integrated into the big -- into the divisions, where they'd be integrated. I noticed that Catalao is on the growth profile. It's on the project pipeline, which I think, if I look back quite a long time, I haven't seen Catalao as a growth project at Anglo for a long time. And I wonder if you could speak through the strategy and plan there and what you're seeing and why they're suddenly important to Anglo again."

Let's go back. I'll try to knock out this dividend policy question. Again, as I've said a little bit early of the progressive dividend policy, we -- and that means that we -- it's either maintained -- our dividends are either maintained off of a base or increased through the cycle. And you would be aware that obviously we made an increase at the tail end of last year with the base annual dividend per share of $0.65 per share that we reestablished in 2010. So perhaps I'll leave it at that. In terms of the project hurdles, I'm not sure that New Largo is exactly the one that we want to pick out. I would just say, generally -- and then Norman, maybe I'll ask you to comment on some of the challenges maybe in South Africa, because you've got -- you've actually brought onstream Mafube, that is adding a really good value, fully operational. You're right in the process of bringing on Zibulo. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. But clearly, on the projects execution and delivery side, there are hurdles, starting first with labor shortages and starting first in Australia. I mean, we're-- you would be very well aware of those challenges there. Now what are we doing about it? We are not waiting for those projects to even be confirmed. We are preparing for those projects now. So in the case of Grosvenor macro project in Australia, again, we don't expect confirmation until the first quarter of next year. On the other hand, we're looking at our needs from a critical resource standpoint and capacity standpoint, from a young talent standpoint, from a particular functional standpoint. So whether we're looking for engineers or geologists or miners, we are preparing and understanding, person-by-person, man-by-man, what our needs are for the next number of years, for the next 5 years. And it's an extremely helpful process. It is multifaceted, multilayered. And Seamus and the team are going to places like Canada, Germany, the United States to start recruiting for those projects for years to come. So that's one answer to how we're dealing with some of this. Now Norman, I'd like you to stand up and just comment on the question about how you bring projects online in South Africa, because I think you've got some very, very good examples."

Your question about Copebras, Catalao and Peace River coal, maybe I can just touch on Peace River coal for a minute. So why did we retain this? We -- Seamus and the team from Australia have spent quite a bit of time on the ground. We think that it's all metallurgical coal.  We're only producing about 1 million tons, not even that, this year, but we think there is more potential. And it's about sharing expertise. It's about applying best practices and doing things differently. So we think this resource does have the potential to increase production substantially. We haven't yet defined exactly to what extent, but I will say substantially. And so that is now part of Seamus' group. In terms of Copebras and Catalao, these businesses will be managed as core businesses within Anglo American, and we're just now determining exactly under which individual. But we believe that their quality -- they're assets, in the case of Copebras, given where the phosphate business is today, the margins that we're reaping, we are looking at and assessing how this business is likely to evolve. So that's really where it is. Catalao, we've identified a lot more resources and niobium in Brazil there, substantially more. And we're looking at seeing how we can actually expand that operation.

So I'm just wondering whether you've actually seen any impact on consumption at all for your commodities across the board and whether you've actually lowered any of your growth expectations."

First question, I'm not going to answer, only to say that, as I said, $400 million just from those 5 operation reviews. We're doing 7 this year, and already, we've identified substantial amount of value that we yet to deliver out of some of those operations. So I -- we're working on how that's going to flow through to the bottom line and when. We haven't yet taken a decision on how we're going to share that with the market, and we'll probably do that either at the year end results. In terms of the question on outlook, Heath, we actually have increased the prices on all the long-term prices for our commodities. So with every single one, we've made those increases. And we think, actually, for every one of our commodities, the growth actually looks very, very strong. I mean, we've got average growth on the Platinum side of 3% to 4%. We think that the market is pretty much in balance right now. Copper, obviously -- it has a -- we expect a significant deficit this year of around 500,000 tons at least. We -- and longer-term demand in the neighborhood of about 3% to 4%. China representing, in the near term, about 7%. I think in terms of Iron Ore and Met Coal, Met Coal has come up by 8% year-on-year thus far. And the outlook is -- continues to be very, very strong. We're seeing steel production, obviously, come up significantly in -- starting first in China but across the world, including Europe and the U.S. So I would say, overall, we are -- despite that volatility and despite that nervousness, we think that the consumption of our commodities, all of our commodities, will be very strong, both in the near, medium and the long term. And obviously, I did also mention, on the Platinum side, we think that there's a lot of upside given that at the Platinum, we'll be coming on even more strongly out into the future. So growth there -- I mean, we saw a growth this year, thus far, of the market in Platinum of about 7%. On the autocatalyst side, it was up by over 50%. I mean, it's just fantastic. And again, we'll come back and talk to you more about a Platinum outlook. I know Neville will, but we think there's a lot of upside in the market there. Thank you, Heath. Okay, everybody, we need to wrap it up. But David, you have a quick question, a burning question."

Yes, I have to say I am a little tired of the question, but I'm not surprised that you continue to ask the question. So with respect to Platinum, let me just back up a little bit and then put it in perspective from where we sit",613,"Okay. Okay, first question. Yes, I have to say I am a little tired of the question, but I'm not surprised that you continue to ask the question. So with respect to Platinum, let me just back up a little bit and then put it in perspective from where we sit. Our #1 objective is to deliver shareholder value across all of our businesses. That -- let's be clear about that. And this means that we continuously review the entire Anglo American portfolio of businesses and our positions in that portfolio. This includes the ownership of Anglo American Platinum. However, our strategy remains clear, and we focus on commodities that we believe will deliver the best return through the economic cycle. And with those commodities, we focus on Tier 1 assets that have large scale, long life, have low cost profiles and offer clear expansion potential. And we remain committed to maximizing the value of these synergies while reviewing the portfolio structure. We believe PGMs are highly attractive, and they have fantastic long-term fundamentals. PGMs provide material exposure to late cycle development of the emerging countries and a shift towards carbon reduction technology. And our Platinum assets represent one, if not the best Tier 1 resource position in the world. I think in terms of the -- our intervention and our involvement in the Platinum business, I don't think there can be a question about that. We have made significant impact and improvements over the years with Neville and the team to achieve best practice to Anglo American standard and applying expertise both within the Platinum business but also from Anglo American. We've improved the safety performance. Fatalitites are down by almost 70% since 2007. Headcount has been reduced by about 30,000. We've had flat cost for 3 years running. We've got another challenge this year. Productivity has increased hugely, and we are benefiting from the Platinum business as they are benefiting from us. I think the group structure is highly effective with -- the businesses are benefiting from the synergies of Anglo American's global scale and broader financial and technical resources. And I think this clearly demonstrates -- it has been demonstrated through the economic benefits delivered year-to-date through asset optimizations, as an example, of about $300 million or procurement of $100 million. And let me put this into context. Platinum's assets are the equivalent of the cover of the Pilbara of Iron Ore, but they're not carved up or co-owned by Rio Tinto or BHP or FMG. And in the Bowen Basin of Met Coal, BHB Billiton has 50% of BMA. So we think that these are great assets. We think that we're adding substantial value. We think that they're adding value to us. And given the market outlook of Platinum and PGMs in general, we think that the returns of this business will be that much more attractive and add that much more to Anglo American going forward. Okay, with that, everybody -- oh, sorry, David. Question about Finland. We do have a lot of work going on in Northern Finland. I can't share it with you as much as I would like to today, but we will come back at the year end results, we believe -- Brian, where are you -- when we have confirmed the resource and the makeup of that resource and give you the specifics around it.
So with that everybody, I thank you again for your attention. I thank you for yours in South Africa and for those on the phone. We certainly appreciate your support. We appreciate your interest. We appreciate the time that you've spent with us today. Thank you very much."
