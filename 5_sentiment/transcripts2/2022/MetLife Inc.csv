MetLife's financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography, allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, 1 of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3. 
In the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal. Yet MetLife's diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9% with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress. 
MetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6%, and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amount ever posted by MetLife. 
We believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife's purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company's purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic. 
Over the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot heal the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people's lives. 
Finally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continue to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage. 
Despite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise, that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success. 
MetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth's sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy. 
We were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife's shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August. 
As a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly. 
I would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one, provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it, and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete. 
As our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% in the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels. 
And in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call. 
We are steadfastly making good on our promises while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I'll close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique. 
We have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain wedded to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife's success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged. 
The next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge. 
Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail."
185648,1763385049,2483966,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we pr",2888,"Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings. 
Net derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. 
On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health,  the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of '21 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization. 
That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences. 
Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of '20 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q '20, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. 
In addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q '21 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. 
In addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean and Cage returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19-related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $177 million, excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter. 
Higher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return. 
Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the 4 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. 
COVID reported claims in 4Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q. 
As a result, these 2 competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2021. 
VII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter. 
Our venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion we're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the 4 quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each. 
For the full year,  these 3 businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 8 quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '21 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and group benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021. 
Our statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year. 
Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. 
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2016 through 2020.  This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '21 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. 
Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. 
Turning back to Page 11. We expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE. 
Moving to near-term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024. 
This is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. 
Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. 
Now I'd like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021.  These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we've begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds. 
In addition, our 2022 average VIII asset balance also factors in, our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds. 
So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. 
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base. 
Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%, excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. 
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range. 
Overall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage paydowns and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID. 
For MetLife Holdings,  we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually, higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels. 
Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14.  For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid- to high single-digit growth over the near term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near term. 
Relative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022, excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024. 
Finally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits over the near term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect to me adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid- to high single digits on a constant currency basis. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. 
In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.SPEAKER01"

So now overall, I would just say and as we said in prior meetings, I think the in general, the team continues to execute here and it's really been embedded in our culture from an efficiency mindset perspective. And fourth quarter was elevated. It's in line with what we expected.  We have those seasonal enrollment costs. We had some timing on some investments in technology. And then we did see a creep up in employee costs occur in the quarter. That was that was offset from a ratio perspective by the fact that we did have some elevated participating claims, which impacts PFOs in the group business. And full year, that's a little over $1 billion, as we mentioned earlier. So you need to -- if you think about the full year ratio, you almost need to adjust for that. So maybe 30 basis points normalization. So nonetheless, I mean, still a very healthy margin relative to our 12.3%. And I think as we look forward, we continue to target 12.3%. I mean we do see an inflationary environment ahead of us. We think our -- we believe and we expect to still manage within our 12.3%. We think it's the right target for us.

If circumstances dictate, we can let some of that leverage fall to the bottom line. And manage the firm that way. But ultimately, this kind of mentality helps us to build our efficiency muscles in the firm. It keeps us away from those disruptive, often fleeting big bang expense program. So all in all, we're still committed to the 12.3% at this point."

So first of all, with respect to the range, the guidance still remains between 70 to 75. So we're not changing that range. And as you correctly pointed out, the uptick in this quarter for the ratio was largely driven by the seasonality of the dental claims. I would point out that this is kind of entirely expected as we typically see an increase in the utilization in the fourth quarter was participants and providers look to the annual maximums in mind and essentially look to utilize the benefit. So we typically see that uptick in the fourth quarter with Dental. 
With respect to disability, I'll maybe break it down for you into 2 pieces. First is the long-term disability piece. We did see a slightly higher incident rates this quarter compared to historical pre-pandemic norms. This is a slight tick up and well within the range of the normal variations we've seen around these claims. At the same time, for long-term disability, we continue to see pretty strong offsets with respect to recoveries, which are also trending higher than the historical norms. So that's kind of the long-term piece on this ability. The short-term disability piece, we have seen a rise in COVID claims in the quarter. And we've also seen a rise in some noncovered incidents, which rise in pregnancies as an example. But however, the financial impact on our bottom line from the STD block is really small, and that's driven by the relative size of the STD block. It's about 1/3 of our overall disability block as well as the mix of our STD business, where half of the block by live is ASO business where we're not on the hook for the claims. So all in all, when you just step back from a disability perspective, while we've seen that small increase in the LTD levels, we are not seeing any evidence of a trend here at this point, but we clearly continue to watch this very carefully."

So first of all, I would say we're extremely pleased with the sales in '21. They're record sales for us, and that's something we're very happy about. If you look at the composition of those sales, we've had positive momentum across all of our products and markets. But what really stood out in '21 is the main driver of the increase in sales was the jumbo end of the market. And remember, this is the higher end of our national accounts business. So different companies define that differently. But our national accounts business comprise employers with 5,000-plus employees, and this is at the higher end of that segment. Those sales came from across the entire portfolio of products across core and voluntary. The other kind of color I'd give you here is that almost 90% of those jumbo sales came from our existing customers. So these are customers who have been with us for years and in some instances, decades. And the other thing I'd point out on sales here, and we've discussed this in the past, this jumbo end of the market is a part of the market where price is not the sole determining factor for winning the business. 
There are a lot of nonprice elements here, such as service, administration, capabilities, et cetera, that are an important part of the the decision-making. And then maybe the last piece on sales is those jumbo sales can be lumpy. And as we look forward into '22, we are seeing less movement in the jumbo market. And so we're expecting that activity to come down in '22 from a jumbo perspective. So that's kind of a bit of a color on sales. With respect to pricing, I'd make a few points. 
One is that we've had an approach that's been disciplined and consistent in the market. We've had a very long track record of being disciplined. And a big part of that is working closely with our customers and intermediaries to ensure that they understand our actions and they're transparent and understood in the marketplace. And that's been true over the last year. So we have been implementing a range of price increases across life and disability blocks commensurate with our profitability target and commensurate with our views on near- and medium-term mortality as well as their views on employment and rates. And the data point I would give you here with respect to pricing, if you look at the 1/1 renewal season, we've been able to achieve our desired margin for those renewals, and we've maintained strong persistency in our book. And so our view is that the market is generally absorbing those price increases, and you do see that in the PFO number that we've posted. And at the end of the day, another kind of point for you on the discipline is our guidance ranges for both mortality and nonmedical health ratios, which kind of remain unchanged into '22."

But it's -- as we talked about, our sensitivity is much less these days. So it's a modest benefit. And then you have to kind of look deeper into why rates are rising. I think there's a number of things around like inflationary pressures, is that it? And what the other drivers are. So just on an interest rate perspective, as we -- as I said in my opening remarks, the higher rates are positive, and they're partially offset by the fact that the curve is flattening. And partly -- you can see that a little bit in, say, the RIS spreads as they emerge in 2022. That's one of the drivers for why they would come down. The XVII spreads would come down off of '21, not the only one, but one of them. And then I think just holistically on -- as you think about what could drive if it's inflationary pressures, and that could be another thing for consideration. I think again, we're probably a net neutral to positive on inflationary pressures. If you think about our businesses and certainly the group business and is probably a net positive, what also could it be a GDP growth along with that. So a number of different factors that go into it. But all in all, I'd say just the short answer to the question would be kind of a modest positive for rising rates."

And then the way this gets monetized through status is through growth in earnings, which comes through in cash just if we're going to get into a little bit of accounting. It's the cash distributions that come through as well as we have kind of a greater of test with regards to a percent of surplus versus earnings. So just if surplus is greater than -- and that apply that percentage that will be another way you can kind of realize that through dividends."

MetLife's financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding.

MetLife's financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography, allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share.  
In the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, 1 of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3.  
In the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal. Yet MetLife's diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9% with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress.  
MetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6%, and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amounts ever posted by MetLife.  
We believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife's purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company's purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic.  
Over the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot hear the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people's lives.  
Finally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continue to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage.  
Despite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise, that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success.  
MetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth's sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy.  
We were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife's shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter, and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August.  
As a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly.  
I would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one, provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. 
Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it, and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete.  
As our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels.  
And in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call.  
We are steadfastly making good on our promises while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I'll close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique.  
We have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain wedded to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife's success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged.  
The next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge.  
Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail."
185648,1763385049,2484130,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we prov",2889,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings.  
Net derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings.  
On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis.  
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management.  
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of '21 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization.  
That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences.  
Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of '20 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary.  
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q '20, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance.  
With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis.  
In addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q '21 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially.  
In addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean encaje returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19-related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $177 million. Excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter.  
Higher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return.  
Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the 4 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%.  
COVID reported claims in 4Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q.  
As a result, these 2 competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID deaths, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2021.   
VII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter. Our venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion, we're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.  
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the 4 quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each.  
For the full year, these 3 businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia.  
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 8 quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '21 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and Group Benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. 
That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6% and well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.  
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  
In 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021.  
Our statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year.  
Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data.  
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2016 through 2020. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '21 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness.  
Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also, Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business.  
Turning back to Page 11. We expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. 
FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE. 
Moving to near-term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024.  
This is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment.  
Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term.  
Now I'd like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021. 
These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we've begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds.  
In addition, our 2022 average VII asset balance also factors in our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds.  
So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted.  
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base.  
Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%, excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%.  
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range.  
Overall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage paydowns and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID.  
For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually, higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels.  
Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid- to high single-digit growth over the near term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. 
In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near term. Relative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022. And excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024.  
Finally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits over the near term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect EMEA adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid- to high single digits on a constant currency basis. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. 
In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success.

So now overall, I would just say and as we said in prior meetings, I think the in general, the team continues to execute here, and it's really been embedded in our culture from an efficiency mindset perspective. And fourth quarter was elevated. It's in line with what we expected. We have those seasonal enrollment costs. We had some timing on some investments in technology. And then we did see a creep up in employee costs occur in the quarter. That was that was offset from a ratio perspective by the fact that we did have some elevated participating claims, which impacts PFOs in the group business. And full year, that's a little over $1 billion, as we mentioned earlier. 
So you need to -- if you think about the full year ratio, you almost need to adjust for that. So maybe 30 basis points normalization. So nonetheless, I mean, still a very healthy margin relative to our 12.3%. And I think as we look forward, we continue to target 12.3%. I mean we do see an inflationary environment ahead of us. We think our -- we believe and we expect to still manage within our 12.3%. We think it's the right target for us. And I think it allows us to utilize our expense leverage to fund investment in growth and technology. 
If circumstances dictate, we can let some of that leverage fall to the bottom line and manage the firm that way. But ultimately, this kind of mentality helps us to build our efficiency muscles in the firm. It keeps us away from those disruptive, often fleeting big bang expense program. So all in all, we're still committed to the 12.3% at this point."

So first of all, with respect to the range, the guidance still remains between 70 to 75. So we're not changing that range. And as you correctly pointed out, the uptick in this quarter for the ratio was largely driven by the seasonality of the dental claims. I would point out that this is kind of entirely expected as we typically see an increase in the utilization in the fourth quarter was participants and providers look to the annual maximums in mind and essentially look to utilize the benefit. So we typically see that uptick in the fourth quarter with Dental. 
With respect to disability, I'll maybe break it down for you into 2 pieces. First is the long-term disability piece. We did see a slightly higher incident rates this quarter compared to historical pre-pandemic norms. This is a slight tick up and well within the range of the normal variations we've seen around these claims. At the same time, for long-term disability, we continue to see pretty strong offsets with respect to recoveries, which are also trending higher than the historical norms. So that's kind of the long-term piece on disability. The short-term disability piece, we have seen a rise in COVID claims in the quarter. And we've also seen a rise in some non-COVID incidents, which rise in pregnancies as an example. But however, the financial impact on our bottom line from the STD block is really small, and that's driven by the relative size of the STD block. It's about 1/3 of our overall disability block as well as the mix of our STD business, where half of the block by lives is ASO business where we're not on the hook for the claims. So all in all, when you just step back from a disability perspective, while we've seen that small increase in the LTD levels, we are not seeing any evidence of a trend here at this point, but we clearly continue to watch this very carefully."

So first of all, I would say we're extremely pleased with the sales in '21. They're record sales for us, and that's something we're very happy about. If you look at the composition of those sales, we've had positive momentum across all of our products and markets. But what really stood out in '21 is the main driver of the increase in sales was the jumbo end of the market. And remember, this is the higher end of our national accounts business. So different companies define that differently. But our national accounts business comprise employers with 5,000-plus employees, and this is at the higher end of that segment. 
Those sales came from across the entire portfolio of products across core and voluntary. The other kind of color I'd give you here is that almost 90% of those jumbo sales came from our existing customers. So these are customers who have been with us for years and in some instances, decades. And the other thing I'd point out on sales here, and we've discussed this in the past, this jumbo end of the market is a part of the market where price is not the sole determining factor for winning the business. 
There are a lot of nonprice elements here, such as service, administration, capabilities, et cetera, that are an important part of the decision-making. And then maybe the last piece on sales is those jumbo sales can be lumpy. And as we look forward into '22, we are seeing less movement in the jumbo market. And so we're expecting that activity to come down in '22 from a jumbo perspective. So that's kind of a bit of a color on sales. With respect to pricing, I'd make a few points. 
One is that we've had an approach that's been disciplined and consistent in the market. We've had a very long track record of being disciplined. And a big part of that is working closely with our customers and intermediaries to ensure that they understand our actions and they're transparent and understood in the marketplace. And that's been true over the last year. So we have been implementing a range of price increases across life and disability blocks commensurate with our profitability target and commensurate with our views on near- and medium-term mortality as well as their views on employment and rates. And the data point I would give you here with respect to pricing, if you look at the 1/1 renewal season, we've been able to achieve our desired margin for those renewals, and we've maintained strong persistency in our book. And so our view is that the market is generally absorbing those price increases, and you do see that in the PFO number that we've posted. And at the end of the day, another kind of point for you on the discipline is our guidance ranges for both mortality and nonmedical health ratios, which kind of remain unchanged into '22."

But it's -- as we talked about, our sensitivity is much less these days. So it's a modest benefit. And then you have to kind of look deeper into why rates are rising. I think there's a number of things around like inflationary pressures, is that it? And what the other drivers are. So just on an interest rate perspective, as we -- as I said in my opening remarks, the higher rates are positive, and they're partially offset by the fact that the curve is flattening. And partly -- you can see that a little bit in, say, the RIS spreads as they emerge in 2022. That's one of the drivers for why they would come down. The XVII spreads would come down off of '21, not the only one, but one of them. And then I think just holistically on -- as you think about what could drive if it's inflationary pressures, and that could be another thing for consideration. I think again, we're probably a net neutral to positive on inflationary pressures. If you think about our businesses and certainly the group business and is probably a net positive, what also could it be a GDP growth along with that. So a number of different factors that go into it. But all in all, I'd say just the short answer to the question would be kind of a modest positive for rising rates."

If you think about our top line and what we've seen in 2021, we've achieved really a great momentum across the region. Sales reached a pre-pandemic level -- levels in the third quarter. And then again, in the fourth quarter, our persistency has also been very resilient and above expectations across most markets. And coupled with the strong sales has really delivered a strong and solid PFO growth in 2021. And when we're seeing this, we're confident to see this moving forward, that momentum to continue. And that demonstrates really the strength, the diversity and the resiliency of our distribution channels and product mix, right? So if you combine this with the swift implementation of several digital capabilities in our largest markets. That allows us to service our customers faster and better and to be more efficient. So all in all, this highlights the underlying fundamentals of the franchise and the strength and the view in the view that once the pandemic returns to normal, and the pandemic recedes, our earnings run rate also will return to normal.

It was a strong quarter led by variable investment income. While we continue to experience some headwinds from COVID-19, we maintain momentum with solid growth and persistency across many of our businesses. 
First quarter net income was $606 million compared to $290 million in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion compared to adjusted earnings of $2 billion a year ago. The decrease was a function of even stronger private equity returns in the prior year period. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were $2.08 compared to $2.20 a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our business segments. Starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $112 million, up 20%, primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and volume growth. The business also continued to see strong top line momentum, with growth across most products, including voluntary benefits. Retirement and Income Solutions adjusted earnings were $581 million down 16% largely driven by lower variable investment income compared to an outsized contribution a year ago. Volume growth provided a partial offset. 
In Asia, adjusted earnings were down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were lower recurring interest margins and less favorable equity markets. Volume growth provided a partial offset. 
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were $142 million, up significantly on both a reported and a constant currency basis as COVID-19-related claims subsided. Strong sales and persistency across the region contributed to top line growth, with adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues up 22% on a constant currency basis. 
In EMEA, adjusted earnings were down 27% on a reported basis and 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period and higher expenses, lower COVID-19-related impacts and volume growth provided partial offsets. 
And finally, in MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. The primary drivers were lower variable investment income compared to an outsized contribution a year ago and less favorable underwriting. Further details regarding the performance of our business segments can be found in our earnings release dated May 4. 
Here are some key enterprise metrics. MetLife's adjusted return on equity was 14.7% and book value per common share was $57.12. 
Turning to cash and capital management. Cash and liquid assets at our holding companies was $4.2 billion at March 31, above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. In the first quarter, we bought back more than $900 million of our common shares and paid approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. 
In addition, our Board of Directors recently declared a second quarter common stock dividend of $0.50 per share, an increase of 4.2% from the first quarter dividend and approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, reflecting the ongoing confidence in our business. 
In an environment rife with uncertainty, MetLife remains resilient. Our financial results in the quarter were strong. Our underlying performance is demonstrating a healthy momentum. Our cash and capital position is solid, and we remain committed to consistent execution. Thank you for watching."

MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022. With the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic that hasn't fully lucent its script, these results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife's purpose of always with you, building a more confident future, is ringing through with our customers now more than ever.
Starting with our financial results. We reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. 
Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movements and impairments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. 
Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. 
Let's shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pretax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return with higher PE balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact our VII results in the second quarter. 
For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation generating strong returns and supporting our long-dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. 
Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and a transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation while establishing a new fee-generating business venture. 
Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights. I'll start with our U.S. group benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment levels and higher salaries. Although COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. 
Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders and every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. 
With our scale and leadership the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent, something we will simply not allow to happen. We've taken concrete actions to grow and established products like group life, dental and disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like [ Vision and PET ]. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last 3 years looking past park claims. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% and primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. 
Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. 
For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year, driven by a good fiscal year-end in Japan. 
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than [ $100 million ] from the prior period as COVID claims moderated in Mexico. The exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which, in turn, has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. 
Shifting to capital and cash. We returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. 
With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding company. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. 
Turning to governance. MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors, and we were pleased to announce the addition of [ Carla Harris ] at the end of April. [ Carla ] is a [ well-recognized ] leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. 
Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global [Technical Difficulty], MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. 
I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to my life over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Vice Strategy Officer; as Head of MetLife Auto and Home; and finally, as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. [ Linden Oliver ] will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President Asia. [ John ] Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and [ Dimitri Lorenzen  will move from Head of Strategy, product and marketing format Life Japan to head our strategy for MetLife. 
These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to an accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
At the end of the quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of  [ DEI ] commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions and other efforts and are firmly aligned with MetLife's purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear road maps and strengthening accountability for progress. 
Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife's return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28. Our new model, future work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and understanding our talent. Our future work model has been well received in the U.S., and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. 
We are also well underway to adopting our future work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in person meetings and feed off the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team's enthusiasm and energy levels has been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face-to-face with many of you in the months ahead. The past 2 years has been an unprecedented period, but with all the challenges, MetLife [Technical Difficulty] on consistent execution, and we look forward to building on our momentum. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."

I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions.
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of a significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. 
In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to a [Technical Difficulty] as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. 
Following the impairment and the sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. 
On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of '21. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.08 and down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of '22, at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1% due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of '21, which were driven by exceptionally strong [ jumbo ] cases. While [ jumbo ] case activity was significantly lower in 1Q '22, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remains strong. 
Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity return versus a very strong Q1 of '21. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 89 basis points up 1 basis point versus 1Q '21, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year as growth across most products, primarily U.K. longevity, reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and the decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales in Japan. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remained elevated in 1Q '22 at roughly $30 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean and [ Taihe ] had a negative 4% return in 1Q '22 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. 
While LatAm's bottom line has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in first quarter of '21 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. 
Corporate and other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to corporate and other from RIS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of '22, to better align asset liability management for these 2 segments. Higher expenses were a partial offset. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last 5 quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits' adjusted earnings. The group life mortality ratio was 103.8% in the first quarter of '22, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. 
While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these 2 competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. 
In addition, we experienced 1 to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a larger number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period to period. 
On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first quarter of '22. The strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. 
Unlike previous quarters, where we have seen a dispersion of returns by fund type, this quarter, our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. 
As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of '22. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q '22, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES as to Corporate and Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia's higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance as well as higher PE asset balances. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth, and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in group benefits due to excess mortality. 
We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher and holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect [ holdco ] cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. 
In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022 as a result of higher U.S. interest rates but remain well above its capital target level. 
Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Obviously, it was 181, main driver there being VII. And then our result ex VII, was 89 basis points of spread. And just to maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread was a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. 
I think one of the things that was performed better than expected is we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1. So that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. 
I'd say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we've already seen in 2Q, we'd probably expect kind of that mid-single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we'd actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit. 
And I'd say there's probably 2 reasons for that. So one is -- so we give the sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after, they're not as good as they were the day before. And so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about [ Horizon lever ] having a headwind at some point, that kind of flips to be a positive. And that's probably kind of around the 200 basis point level. And so we're at maybe a little above 130 today. 
So we'd expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, they would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing, as you point out, just kind of the overall increase in rates that typically comes in the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower -- not as quickly. And so -- but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully, that helps."

The 2 aspects of our philosophy, which I want to just reiterate here and highlight, one is the -- this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline. And I would say, in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets, and it's also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you've heard us talk about before is that we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there, and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. 
In terms of the outlook, as you know, we had a very strong quarter in '21. The fourth quarter of '21, we ended with 5 transactions that were totaled of EUR 3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. 
In terms of the segments we play in, that [ jumbo ] segment, many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don't kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kind of asset allocations have been prepositioned and therefore, at that [ jumbo ] end, it doesn't tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels, and that boat was for the overall pipeline as well."

In terms of employment, that's a tailwind. We're starting to see that in the business. Clearly, higher employment levels that provide just more eligibles and therefore, more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So I don't expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick, and it does depend on the population that's getting those wage increases, et cetera.

One is the translation impact on earnings. And the second one is the impact on sales. 
On earnings, we have a multicurrency balance sheet in Japan because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen denominated. And so therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, if I can say that, on Asia adjusted earnings. 
On the sales, however, the FX volatility, more than the rate itself, there's the volatility that is very important. The rates a consideration as well. It impacts the volumes of far products in the near term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before they commit their yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it's a U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen -- the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value, making them more attractive. 
So there's a balance both ways. And currently, we're seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about it, that's the way I would look at it, yes, I'll leave it at that."

I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. It's a very strong performance. There are 3 reasons why I would attribute that. 
[ Firstly ], our execution on the ground has been quite strong. Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know. And that is continuing to show where certainly, there's a little bit of softness on the bank side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA. So that balances back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities. Over the past 2 years, but most notably, over the past 12 months, we've had a couple of successful product launches. And most recently, we entered the [ COLI ] market again. And so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new [ Banca ] platform in last year, which has got a very strong reception. And then we also entered the variable product market, so that's also getting good traction as well. 
So we're very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really -- we're very good, but also caution that we're continuing to deal with COVID. And that's a big factor across all our markets. Clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter 1. And we're dealing with that even in China as well. 
And so -- and then on top of that, in Q2, we're dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange-related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there's a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end. So that's been a tailwind, which doesn't carry through to Q2. 
Given on that, the volume of sales in the next quarter, will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia as Japan to come longer in Q2 to offset that as well. 
So that's. We've done well in Q1, a little bit of pressure in Q2. And then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this, our execution has been very strong, our diversity of markets are coming [ to ]. And so from a guidance perspective, I'd stick to the mid to high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective."

And so you need to kind of see a trend before you would necessarily make a change. But again, we'll have to kind of evaluate all the data that's out there when we get closer. 
In terms of inflation, it's probably -- it's not -- it's really -- I'd say probably more related to your first part of the question, what is that -- how does that really impact rates. That's probably the biggest area for us when it comes to reserving. I think outside of that, it's -- there's generally if you have any inflation impact, it's generally offset by other factors, net-net. So that's probably how I'd answer the inflation point."

With the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic that hasn't fully lucent its script, these results demonstrate the strength and",1438,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.  MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022. With the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic that hasn't fully lucent its script, these results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife's purpose of always with you, building a more confident future, is ringing through with our customers now more than ever. 
Starting with our financial results. We reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. 
Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movements and impairments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. 
Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. 
Let's shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pretax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return with higher PE balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact our VII results in the second quarter. 
For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation generating strong returns and supporting our long-dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. 
Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and a transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation while establishing a new fee-generating business venture. 
Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights. I'll start with our U.S. group benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment levels and higher salaries. Although COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. 
Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders and every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. 
With our scale and leadership the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent, something we will simply not allow to happen. We've taken concrete actions to grow and established products like group life, dental and disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like Vision and PET. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last 3 years looking past claims. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% and primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. 
Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. 
For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year, driven by a good fiscal year-end in Japan. 
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period as COVID-19 claims moderated in Mexico. The exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which, in turn, has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. 
Shifting to capital and cash. We returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. 
With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding company. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. 
Turning to governance. MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors, and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. 
Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global [Technical Difficulty], MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. 
I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Vice Strategy Officer; as Head of MetLife Auto and Home; and finally, as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy, Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head our Strategy for MetLife. 
These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to an accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
At the end of the quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of  DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions and other efforts and are firmly aligned with MetLife's purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear road maps and strengthening accountability for progress. 
Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife's return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28. Our new model, future work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and understanding our talent. Our future work model has been well received in the U.S., and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. 
We are also well underway to adopting our future work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in person meetings and feed off the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team's enthusiasm and energy levels has been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face-to-face with many of you in the months ahead. The past 2 years has been an unprecedented period, but with all the challenges, MetLife is laser focused on consistent execution, and we look forward to building on our momentum. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."

I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adju",1815,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of a significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. 
In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairment in Russian and Ukrainian bonds as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. 
Following the impairment and the sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. 
On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of '21. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.08 and down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of '22, at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1% due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of '21, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q '22, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remains strong. 
Retirement and  Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity return versus a very strong Q1 of '21. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 89 basis points up 1 basis point versus 1Q '21, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year as growth across most products, primarily U.K. longevity, reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and the decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales in Japan. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remained elevated in 1Q '22 at roughly $30 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean encaje had a negative 4% return in 1Q '22 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. 
While LatAm's bottom line has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in first quarter of '21 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of '22, to better align asset liability management for these 2 segments. Higher expenses were a partial offset. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last 5 quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits' adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 103.8% in the first quarter of '22, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. 
While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these 2 competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. 
In addition, we experienced 1 to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a larger number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period to period. 
On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first quarter of '22. The strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. 
Unlike previous quarters, where we have seen a dispersion on returns by fund type, this quarter, our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. 
As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of '22. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q '22, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES as to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia's higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance as well as higher PE asset balances. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth, and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in group benefits due to excess mortality. 
We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect holdco cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. 
In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022 as a result of higher U.S. interest rates but remain well above its capital target level. 
Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company, will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Obviously, it was 181, main driver there being VII. And then our result ex VII, was 89 basis points of spread. And just to maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread was a few basis points and that",346,"Ryan, yes. So let me just start with Q1. Obviously, it was 181, main driver there being VII. And then our result ex VII, was 89 basis points of spread. And just to maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread was a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. 
I think one of the things that was performed better than expected is we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1. So that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. 
I'd say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we've already seen in 2Q, we'd probably expect kind of that mid-single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we'd actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit. 
And I'd say there's probably 2 reasons for that. So one is -- so we give the sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after, they're not as good as they were the day before. And so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about rising LIBOR having a headwind at some point, that kind of flips to be a positive. And that's probably kind of around the 200 basis point level. And so we're at maybe a little above 130 today. 
So we'd expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, they would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing, as you point out, just kind of the overall increasing rates, that typically comes in -- the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower -- not as quickly. And so -- but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully, that helps."

Again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to.

So maybe just I'll -- may be helpful just to reiterate our philosophy towards the PRT market, and then I'll come and hit your question in terms of the pipeline. 
The 2 aspects of our philosophy, which I want to just reiterate here and highlight, one is the -- this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline. And I would say, in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets, and it's also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you've heard us talk about before is that we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there, and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. 
In terms of the outlook, as you know, we had a very strong quarter in '21. The fourth quarter of '21, we ended with 5 transactions that were totaled of $3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. 
In terms of the segments we play in, that jumbo segment, many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don't kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kind of asset allocations have been prepositioned and therefore, at that jumbo end, it doesn't tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels, and that bodes well for the overall pipeline as well."

And the marketplace is really responding to this with a true flight to quality. That emphasis on quality is also evidenced by the strong persistency, which combined with the robust sales has resulted with an over a 20% growth year-over-year on PFOs on a constant currency basis. 
Now about half of that -- of these sales are coming from the SPIA business in Chile, as we've seen the January market expanding during the first quarter.

That's up and down market and very much kind of in line with our expectations. And as I've highlighted before, we're seeing that persistency even in an environment where we have been taking price increases on, in particular, on the life book, given the uncertainty or on COVID. So the persistency has been really excellent. 
We're also seeing continued momentum on our voluntary portfolio. And that's kind of continued to drive double-digit PFO growth in our business. And just to give you a flavor of that, we ended the year well above $1 billion of PFOs in voluntary, and we continue to see good growth on that. 
In terms of employment, that's a tailwind. We're starting to see that in the business. Clearly, higher employment levels that provide just more eligibles and therefore, more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So I don't expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick, and it does depend on the population that's getting those wage increases, et cetera. But both of these, I would think of as general tailwinds to the business, and we're seeing evidence of that in our book today."

One is the translation impact on earnings. And the second one is the impact on sales. 
On earnings, we have a multicurrency balance sheet in Japan because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen denominated. And so therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, if I can say that, on Asia adjusted earnings. 
On the sales, however, the FX volatility, more than the rate itself, there's the volatility that is very important. The rates a consideration as well. It impacts the volumes of our FX products in the near term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before they commit their yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it's a U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen -- the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value, making them more attractive. 
So there's a balance both ways. And currently, we're seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about it, that's the way I would look at it, yes, I'll leave it at that."

There really were 2 issues that led to virtually all of the realized losses in the first quarter. One, as you pointed out, was Russia, and that was roughly half of the credit losses and provisions. And again, I'd start though by reminding everyone that our total exposure to Russia is less than 1/10% to 1% of the general account. So in some not really a material number. 
And then the second piece on the losses, John also mentioned was normal trading activity, but that really just reflected what was happening with interest rates in the quarter. And if you think about, again, our asset liability management, we are heavily investing in private assets right now, and it takes time to originate those private assets. So we're putting in assets that are more liquid. And as we replace those in the permanent structure with private assets, given the interest rate movements in the quarter, we saw losses in that. But again, we pick it up on the back end, of course, because the private assets are higher yielding."

I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. It's a very strong performance. There are 3 reasons why I would attribute that. 
Firstly, our execution on the ground has been quite strong. Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know. And that is continuing to show where certainly, there's a little bit of softness on the banker side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA. So that balances back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities. Over the past 2 years, but most notably, over the past 12 months, we've had a couple of successful product launches. And most recently, we entered the COLI market again. And so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new banker platform in last year, which has got a very strong reception. And then we also entered the variable product market, so that's also getting good traction as well. 
So we're very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really -- were very good, but also caution that we're continuing to deal with COVID. And that's a big factor across all our markets. Clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter 1. And we're dealing with that even in China as well. 
And so -- and then on top of that, in Q2, we're dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange-related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there's a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end. So that's been a tailwind, which doesn't carry through to Q2. 
Given all that, the volume of sales in the next quarter, will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia, as Japan to come in stronger in Q2 to offset that as well. 
So that's. We've done well in Q1, a little bit of pressure in Q2. And then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this, our execution has been very strong, our diversity of markets are coming through. And so from a guidance perspective, I'd stick to the mid to high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective."

But I think it's a testament to the team and really the embedded culture that we've built here around efficiency mindset. It's a critical component of our strategy, as you mentioned. 
Just on the ratio itself, it was 11.7%. I mentioned in the opening remarks that you have to be careful -- the headline number is probably benefiting about 40 basis points from elevated COVID claims, which impact our participating cases and that creates increase in revenue, is a bit of a gross up on the P&L. 
So net-net, we're still we're a little above 12%, but still below the 12.3%. And that's within there, it also includes our intention to continue to invest in the firm for growth to improve our use of technologies. And then obviously, if circumstances dictate that gives us optionality to leverage that capacity in different ways and to protect margins.

MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022. With the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic that hasn't fully lucent its script, these results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife's purpose of always with you, building a more confident future, is ringing through with our customers now more than ever. 
Starting with our financial results. We reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. 
Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movements and impairments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. 
Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. 
Let's shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pretax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return with higher PE balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact our VII results in the second quarter. 
For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation generating strong returns and supporting our long-dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. 
Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and a transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation while establishing a new fee-generating business venture. 
Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights. I'll start with our U.S. group benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment levels and higher salaries. Although COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. 
Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders and every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. 
With our scale and leadership the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent, something we will simply not allow to happen. We've taken concrete actions to grow and established products like group life, dental and disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like Vision and PET. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last 3 years looking past claims. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% and primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. 
Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. 
For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year, driven by a good fiscal year-end in Japan. 
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period as COVID-19 claims moderated in Mexico. The exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which, in turn, has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. 
Shifting to capital and cash. We returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. 
With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding company. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. 
Turning to governance. MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors, and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. 
Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global company, MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. 
I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Vice Strategy Officer; as Head of MetLife Auto and Home; and finally, as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy, Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head our Strategy for MetLife. 
These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to an accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
At the end of the quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of  DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions and other efforts and are firmly aligned with MetLife's purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear road maps and strengthening accountability for progress. 
Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife's return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28. Our new model, future work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and understanding our talent. Our future work model has been well received in the U.S., and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. 
We are also well underway to adopting our future work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in person meetings and feed off the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team's enthusiasm and energy levels has been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face-to-face with many of you in the months ahead. The past 2 years has been an unprecedented period, but with all the challenges, MetLife is laser focused on consistent execution, and we look forward to building on our momentum. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."

I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions.

I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of a significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. 
In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairment in Russian and Ukrainian bonds as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. 
Following the impairment and the sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. 
On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of '21. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.08 and down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of '22, at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1% due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of '21, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q '22, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remains strong. 
Retirement and  Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity return versus a very strong Q1 of '21. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 89 basis points up 1 basis point versus 1Q '21, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year as growth across most products, primarily U.K. longevity, reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and the decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales in Japan. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remained elevated in 1Q '22 at roughly $30 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean encaje had a negative 4% return in 1Q '22 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. 
While LatAm's bottom line has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in first quarter of '21 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of '22, to better align asset liability management for these 2 segments. Higher expenses were a partial offset. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last 5 quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits' adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 103.8% in the first quarter of '22, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. 
While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these 2 competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. 
In addition, we experienced 1 to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a larger number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period to period. 
On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first quarter of '22. The strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. 
Unlike previous quarters, where we have seen a dispersion on returns by fund type, this quarter, our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. 
As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of '22. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q '22, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES as to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia's higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance as well as higher PE asset balances. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth, and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in group benefits due to excess mortality. 
We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect holdco cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. 
In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022 as a result of higher U.S. interest rates but remain well above its capital target level. 
Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company, will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Obviously, it was 181, main driver there being VII. And then our result ex VII, was 89 basis points of spread. And just to maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread was a few basis points and that",347,"Ryan, yes. So let me just start with Q1. Obviously, it was 181, main driver there being VII. And then our result ex VII, was 89 basis points of spread. And just to maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread was a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. 
I think one of the things that was performed better than expected is we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1. So that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. 
I'd say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we've already seen in 2Q, we'd probably expect kind of that mid single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we'd actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit. 
And I'd say there's probably 2 reasons for that. So one is -- so we give the sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after, they're not as good as they were the day before. And so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about rising LIBOR having a headwind at some point, that kind of flips to be a positive. And that's probably kind of around the 200 basis point level. And so we're at maybe a little above 130 today. 
So we'd expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, they would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing, as you point out, just kind of the overall increasing rates, that typically comes in -- the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower -- not as quickly. And so -- but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully, that helps."

Again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to. And then in terms of stack capital, no, we would not expect any unusual volatility or results as a result of a rising rate environment."

So maybe just I'll -- may be helpful just to reiterate our philosophy towards the PRT market, and then I'll come and hit your question in terms of the pipeline. 
The 2 aspects of our philosophy, which I want to just reiterate here and highlight, one is the -- this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline. And I would say, in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets, and it's also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you've heard us talk about before is that we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there, and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. 
In terms of the outlook, as you know, we had a very strong quarter in '21. The fourth quarter of '21, we ended with 5 transactions that were totaled of $3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. 
In terms of the segments we play in, that jumbo segment, many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don't kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kind of asset allocations have been prepositioned and therefore, at that jumbo end, it doesn't tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels, and that bodes well for the overall pipeline as well."

We're seeing the benefits of that diversification strategy that combined with the increased awareness that Michel mentioned and that demand of insurance combined with the swift implementation of digital capabilities before, during and now as we get out of the pandemic allows us to sell and serve our customers better. 
And the marketplace is really responding to this with a true flight to quality. That emphasis on quality is also evidenced by the strong persistency, which combined with the robust sales has resulted with an over a 20% growth year-over-year on PFOs on a constant currency basis.

So the persistency has been really excellent. 
We're also seeing continued momentum on our voluntary portfolio. And that's kind of continued to drive double-digit PFO growth in our business. And just to give you a flavor of that, we ended the year well above $1 billion of PFOs in voluntary, and we continue to see good growth on that. 
In terms of employment, that's a tailwind. We're starting to see that in the business. Clearly, higher employment levels that provide just more eligibles and therefore, more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So I don't expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick, and it does depend on the population that's getting those wage increases, et cetera. But both of these, I would think of as general tailwinds to the business, and we're seeing evidence of that in our book today."

One is the translation impact on earnings. And the second one is the impact on sales. 
On earnings, we have a multicurrency balance sheet in Japan because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen denominated. And so therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, if I can say that, on Asia adjusted earnings. 
On the sales, however, the FX volatility, more than the rate itself, there's the volatility that is very important. The rates a consideration as well. It impacts the volumes of our FX products in the near term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before they commit their yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it's a U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen -- the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value, making them more attractive. 
So there's a balance both ways. And currently, we're seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about it, that's the way I would look at it, yes, I'll leave it at that."

And then the second piece on the losses, John also mentioned was normal trading activity, but that really just reflected what was happening with interest rates in the quarter. And if you think about, again, our asset liability management, we are heavily investing in private assets right now, and it takes time to originate those private assets. So we're putting in assets that are more liquid. And as we replace those in the permanent structure with private assets, given the interest rate movements in the quarter, we saw losses in that. But again, we pick it up on the back end, of course, because the private assets are higher yielding."

I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. It's a very strong performance. There are 3 reasons why I would attribute that. 
Firstly, our execution on the ground has been quite strong. Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know. And that is continuing to show where certainly, there's a little bit of softness on the banker side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA. So that balances back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities. Over the past 2 years, but most notably, over the past 12 months, we've had a couple of successful product launches. And most recently, we entered the COLI market again. And so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new banker platform in last year, which has got a very strong reception. And then we also entered the variable product market, so that's also getting good traction as well. 
So we're very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really -- were very good, but also caution that we're continuing to deal with COVID. And that's a big factor across all our markets. Clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter 1. And we're dealing with that even in China as well. 
And so -- and then on top of that, in Q2, we're dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange-related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there's a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end. So that's been a tailwind, which doesn't carry through to Q2. 
Given all that, the volume of sales in the next quarter, will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia, as Japan to come in stronger in Q2 to offset that as well. 
So that's. We've done well in Q1, a little bit of pressure in Q2. And then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this, our execution has been very strong, our diversity of markets are coming through. And so from a guidance perspective, I'd stick to the mid to high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective."

Just on the ratio itself, it was 11.7%.

So net-net, we're still we're a little above 12%, but still below the 12.3%.

I think as we've all realized that things can change quickly. And so I think it's -- and it is a long-term assumption. 
But having said that, I think you've highlighted some kind of the circumstances we're in that the current rates are higher than our long-term assumption that we projected to hit in 12 years. So that is -- but I wouldn't anticipate kind of any abrupt change one way or the other. We just made that change recent -- a few years ago. And so you need to kind of see a trend before you would necessarily make a change. But again, we'll have to kind of evaluate all the data that's out there when we get closer. 
In terms of inflation, it's probably -- it's not a -- it's really -- I'd say probably more related to your first part of the question, what is that -- how does that really impact rates. That's probably the biggest area for us when it comes to reserving. I think outside of that, it's -- there's generally if you have any inflation impact, it's generally offset by other factors, net-net. So that's probably how I'd answer the inflation point."

Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise. 
The resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share. 
The combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet. 
Also, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period,  MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class. 
In the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter. 
Throughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins. 
Turning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year. 
Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior [indiscernible] during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results. 
At the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve. 
During the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. 
COVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by [ deemed ] hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis. 
In Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year. 
Looking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively. 
Moving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half. 
There remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
Financial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. 
The MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter. 
In closing, when we introduced our Next horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife.  With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."
185648,1789898976,2615565,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2022",2022-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting known as Long D",2165,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. 
In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. 
On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. 
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter. 
The adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period. 
The higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21. 
Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance. 
RIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. 
With regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis. 
In addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth. 
Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LatAm's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. The LatAm's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter. 
LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax. 
In addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline. 
MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter. 
As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss. 
While VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22. 
Asia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. 
While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In addition, holdco cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable [ VA ] rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. 
Now shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/'20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI. 
The changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation and the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a [indiscernible] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances. 
As you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined. 
Finally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success.  And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And I think our plan would be to discuss more details at a later date. But I think the general point, I would probably leave you with is that we don't expect major differences in the core underlying earnings, but there are sources of differences when actuals emerge, right? 
So how actual experience may deviate from expectation, gets treated one way in current GAAP versus under LDTI, and then there's a number of different aspects. But I think all in all, we would expect kind of core earnings. Maybe I'll just give you a little color, too. I think this is probably a good perspective as to why that would be the case. 
So it does not affect all of our segments, right? If you think about group minimal impact, vast majority, not subject to it given it's a short duration product. We go through RIS and it's mainly a spread business. We would expect spread calcs to look similar. 
As you move into MLH, not all products are impacted, right? We have a number of [indiscernible] FAS 97 products, universal life fixed annuities. Also the participating business is not subject to LDTI. And if we took kind of an early look at that and kind of assume that we would implement this the beginning of this year, we probably would have given you the same range of guidance that we would have otherwise given back in February. And then Asia is probably the other one that's somewhat sizable. Again, there's a lot of FAS 97 products there.

And as you point out, we did not quite expect that back in the Q1 call. But that was -- we were basing our commentary based on forward rate curve, right? And if you think about what has happened since the 10-year treasury ends up about 65 basis points above that. And the other thing that happened is spreads widened. So our reinvestments were strong. And then the third thing is 3-month LIBOR jumped to a much greater level than we had expected and actually the forward curve expected ended the quarter at roughly 2.3%. 
If I think about just during the course of the quarter, it was kind of hovering around 150 and then all of a sudden, there was a huge spike kind of at the end of May into June. And bypassing that [indiscernible], I referenced this 2% marker. As LIBOR started to grow, get towards that 2% and then beyond, it could create a little bit of a tailwind. We have a number of caps that start to become in the money.  That we have in place today. 
And so that was really the main driver moving us from a headwind of LIBOR rising to a, if you call it, I guess, a benefit of having the caps be in the money. So that was the real driver. The other thing I'd point out is real estate equity outperformed. So within our core investment income, real estate equity was stronger than expected. We'd expect that to moderate. 
But if we look forward, and I guess, assuming today's current forward rates, which we know can be different, we'd expect ex-VII spreads to remain pretty close to where we are today, I mean, give or take, plus or minus, and even assuming some moderation of the real estate returns."

We have a very diversified distribution channels, and the products and capabilities we've launched in the past year has really helped us drive the growth over there. 
But as you pointed out in Other Asia, we've faced a couple of headwinds. We've got COVID restrictions going on in China right now, and the stronger U.S. dollar has really impacted sales for the FX products in Korea. But despite these channels, we actually have other markets that are compensating for these and help offset some of these headwinds. 
Looking forward, we expect strong momentum going into the third quarter. We're introducing new products in Korea. And also, we expect some relief in the lockdown conditions in China. So full year basis, we are comfortable with the guidance of mid-single year digit growth that we gave at the outlook call."

So overall, this was a strong quarter for the region, supported by solid business fundamentals and several positive items that we really put into 2 buckets, right, the market factors and underwriting. So starting with market factors, we had very strong net investment margins this quarter, which include the net positive impact of inflation in Chile as well as the above-average encaje results. And the quarter also benefited from strong variable investment income. 
So these items combined contributed to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings. Then the second bucket, underwriting, and John mentioned that earlier, this quarter was really recorded a 40 million after-tax benefit from a favorable prior year developments related mainly to COVID mortality experience. So these are the 2 main items. Now putting these items aside, we're also very pleased to see our business continues to deliver. As you may recall, last quarter, I mentioned that our earnings growth continued to be supported by strong and resilient business fundamentals, which are driving solid top line growth. 
And that sales momentum that began last year has continued this quarter as well. And this reflects really the strengths, the resiliency and the diversity of our distribution franchise across the region, combined with a noticeable flight to quality. And then this emphasis on quality is also evidenced by a very solid persistency across the region, which, combined with the strong sales momentum that I mentioned has resulted in a 26% growth year-over-year in PFOs on a constant rate basis. Now about half of that growth came from the SPIA business in Chile, where our market share has increased, but the market as well has grown over the past over the past quarter. So that's in a nutshell, the story for LatAm this quarter. I hope this helps."

And in aggregate, we are getting our target price increases, and we're also continuing to see very strong persistency in the book."

And we're trying to do that both in the form of internal actions but also looking at opportunities to leverage the growing risk transfer market. And as a result, we continue to converse with third parties. 
Our philosophy is there's no burning platform. We're happy to maintain our approach and continue to optimize internally, but we want the optionality to see if we can accelerate the appropriate release of capital and reserves. I think the one thing that we continue to just look at here, this is a reinsurance transaction for us if we were to do something. 
So as we think about our philosophy, when we look at this is, we view this as a long-term relationship. So it's -- this is one of those things that would take time. It takes time to make sure that we feel grounded with a strong counterparty and structure and kind of the approach. 
But I think we're continuing to evaluate that and that's been the case now for some time. In terms of the impact to LDTI, I don't know how to exactly answer that. I think one thing we have to be careful about is under LDTI, one of the things that probably did not come out as perfect was just the -- there is some asymmetrical counting when you do enter into reinsurance. So you have to be mindful of that under GAAP. So it doesn't perfectly line up. So I don't know how to perfectly answer your question that way because it would -- I guess the answer is it depends.

Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all-weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise. 
The resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share. 
The combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet. 
Also, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period,  MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class. 
In the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter. 
Throughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins. 
Turning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million, were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year. 
Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior falls down during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results. 
At the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past, the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve. 
During the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. 
COVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by deemed hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis. 
In Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year. 
Looking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively. 
Moving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half. 
There remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
Financial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. 
The MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter. 
In closing, when we introduced our Next Horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife.  With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."

I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting, known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. 
In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. 
On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. 
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter. 
The adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period. 
The higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21. 
Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance. 
RIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. 
With regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis. 
In addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth. 
Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LATAM's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. LATAM's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter. 
LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax. 
In addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline. 
MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter. 
As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss. 
While VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22. 
Asia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. 
While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In addition, HoldCo cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. 
Now shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI. 
The changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation, the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a single [ rate ] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances. 
As you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined. 
Finally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success.  And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused, company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And I think our plan would be to discuss more details at a later date. But I think the general point, I would probably leave you with is that we don't expect major differences in the core underlying earnings, but there are sources of differences when actuals emerge, right? 
So how actual experience may deviate from expectation, gets treated one way in current GAAP versus under LDTI, and then there's a number of different aspects. But I think all in all, we would expect kind of core earnings. Maybe I'll just give you a little color, too. I think this is probably a good perspective as to why that would be the case. 
So it does not affect all of our segments, right? If you think about group minimal impact, vast majority not subject to it given it's a short duration product. We go through RIS and it's mainly a spread business. We would expect spread calcs to look similar. 
As you move into MLH, not all products are impacted, right? We have a number of FAS 97, [indiscernible] FAS 97 products, universal life, fixed annuities. Also the participating business is not subject to LDTI. And if we took kind of an early look at that and kind of assume that we would implement this the beginning of this year, we probably would have given you the same range of guidance that we would have otherwise given back in February. 
And then Asia is probably other one that's somewhat sizable. Again, there's a lot of FAS 97 products there. Japan, if you think about our flagship products in FX, they're all under FAS 97 versus FAS 60. And then EMEA and LATAM are much more modest. So hopefully, that kind of just gives you color as to why kind of I gave you that general statement."

And as you point out, we did not quite expect that back in the Q1 call. But that was -- we were basing our commentary based on forward rate curve, right? And if you think about what has happened since 10-year treasury ends up about 65 basis points above that. And the other thing that happened is spreads widened. So our reinvestments were strong. And then the third thing is 3-month LIBOR jumped to a much greater level than we had expected and actually the forward curve expected, ended the quarter at roughly 2.3%. 
If I think about just during the course of the quarter, it was kind of hovering around 150 and then all of a sudden, there was a huge spike kind of at the end of May into June. And bypassing that number, I reference this 2% marker. As LIBOR started to grow, get towards that 2% and then beyond, it could create a little bit of a tailwind. We have a number of caps that start to become in the money.  That we have in place today. 
And so that was really the main driver moving us from a headwind of LIBOR rising to a, if you call it, I guess, a benefit of having the caps be in the money. So that was the real driver. The other thing I'd point out is real estate equity outperformed. So within our core investment income, real estate equity was stronger than expected. We'd expect that to moderate. 
But if we look forward, and I guess, assuming today's current forward rates, which we know can be different, we'd expect ex-VII spreads to remain pretty close to where we are today, I mean, give or take, plus or minus, and even assuming some moderation of the real estate returns."

So overall, we've had positive growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in Japan. If we look a little bit at Japan sales, we're up 5%. And that's actually driven by 3 factors. First, the execution on the ground of the team has been very strong. We have a very diversified distribution channels, and the products and capabilities we've launched in the past year has really helped us drive the growth over there. 
But as you pointed out in Other Asia, we've faced a couple of headwinds. We've got COVID restrictions going on in China right now, and the stronger U.S. dollar has really impacted sales for the FX products in Korea. But despite these channels, we actually have other markets that are compensating for these and help drive -- offset some of these headwinds. 
Looking forward, we expect strong momentum going into the third quarter. We're introducing new products in Korea. And also, we expect some relief in the lockdown conditions in China. So full year basis, we are comfortable with the guidance of mid-single year digit growth that we gave at the outlook call."

So starting with market factors, we had very strong net investment margins this quarter, which include the net positive impact of inflation in Chile as well as the above-average encaje results. And the quarter also benefited from strong variable investment income. 
So these items combined contributed to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings. Then the second bucket, underwriting, and John mentioned that earlier, this quarter was really recorded a $40 million after-tax benefit from a favorable prior year developments related mainly to COVID mortality experience. So these are the 2 main items. Now putting these items aside, we're also very pleased to see our business continues to deliver. As you may recall, last quarter, I mentioned that our earnings growth continued to be supported by strong and resilient business fundamentals, which are driving solid top line growth. 
And that sales momentum that began last year has continued this quarter as well. And this reflects really the strengths, the resiliency and the diversity of our distribution franchise across the region, combined with a noticeable flight to quality. And then this emphasis on quality is also evidenced by a very solid persistency across the region, which combined with the strong sales momentum that I mentioned has resulted in a 26% growth year-over-year in PFOs on a constant rate basis. Now about half of that growth came from the SPIA business in Chile, where our market share has increased, but the market as well has grown over the past quarter.

But GMIBs, they're all kind of accrual accounting, if you will, and now they're moving to mark-to-market. So that's the biggest driver. 
As we think about relative to initial impact that we disclosed, it's a little better as you get into kind of year-end '21 in terms of less of a change. I think interest rates moved maybe 60 basis points on the 10-year. And then it will continue to decline, if you will, as you move into 2022, just given the -- a function of the rising rate environment. So that's the -- those are the main drivers."

The third piece is the Q1 reserves, which [ competed ] favorably, which John spoke about, and that was a less than a point or so. 
And then the final piece is we did see little by way of non-COVID excess mortality in the quarter. And as Michel pointed out, the second quarter tends to be a bit lighter in general in terms of mortality. As we look at the rest of the year, on the Group business side, we're cautiously optimistic given the results here. But clearly, you know the trajectory of the pandemic is uncertain. At this point, I would say, if you exclude COVID, we anticipate that our mortality ratio to be comfortably inside our range for the second half of the year for the group business."

And remember, in a way, we sound like a broken record, but we go back to really even pre-COVID where we were actually starting to get concerned about a recession occurring sometime in 2020 and started preparing the portfolio then. 
Our derisking efforts started in a pretty big way. And I think then, of course, was accelerated during COVID, and we went through over $8 billion of derisking in that time period. And that really sort of set the portfolio in a position that we're very comfortable with. 
Obviously, we continue to watch as we go through this period now, expectations of recessions, again, of course, depend how one defines a recession, I guess, these days are clearly picking up. But we're very comfortable with the derisking we've done over the last couple of years and think the portfolio is in very good shape. 
Obviously, we continue to have a cautious attitude, but opportunistic at the same time because we do see some attractive investments, and we have the opportunity to do that. One metric that might be of interest too is just in looking at the portfolio, during the course of this year, we've actually had twice as many upgrades as downgrades.

In terms of the pricing environment, I would say, the market is competitive, but remains rational. In aggregate, we have put in place price increases, both on the life and the disability side to reflect our expectation of the coming environment to reflect also a load with respect to the COVID deaths.

I mean we've probably given a consistent message every quarter for quite some time now. And I think it's the same, and I think we're being very transparent. Our goal here is continuously optimize. And we're trying to do that both in the form of internal actions but also looking at opportunities to leverage the growing risk transfer market. And as a result, we continue to converse with third parties. 
Our philosophy is there's no burning platform. We're happy to maintain our approach and continue to optimize internally, but we want the optionality to see if we can accelerate the appropriate release of capital and reserves. I think the one thing that we continue to just look at here, this is a reinsurance transaction for us if we were to do something. 
So as we think about our philosophy, when we look at this is, we view this as a long-term relationship. So it's -- this is one of those things that would take time. It takes time to make sure that we feel grounded with a strong counterparty and structure and kind of the approach. 
But I think we're continuing to evaluate that and that's been the case now for some time. In terms of the impact to LDTI, I don't know how to exactly answer that. I think one thing we have to be careful about is under LDTI, one of the things that probably did not come out as perfect was just the -- there is some asymmetrical accounting when you do enter into reinsurance. So you have to be mindful of that under GAAP. So it doesn't perfectly line up. So I don't know how to perfectly answer your question that way because we'd have -- it would -- I guess the answer is it depends. So I'm sure that [indiscernible]."

Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more, and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy, which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty. 
Looking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA, which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management. 
Turning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings. 
Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter. 
As you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market, which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500.  Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy, but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates. 
For roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife. 
Shifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86%, which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. 
Execution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well, and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million, which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife.  And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years. 
For Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules, which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products. 
2 weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage. 
In Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum. 
MetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal use of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife. 
The discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIMs ESG capabilities with MEMS fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife. 
Moving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
In closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."
185648,1803468955,2673428,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our ca",2024,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected. 
In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings. 
The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in life as a result of higher earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain, which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions. 
On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable in this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. 
With regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date, and we continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notables were down 73% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products, which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels. 
Latin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower variable investment income and the Chilean and encaje, which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. 
EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21, which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset. 
Corporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23%, which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. 
On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71%, which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
Now let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30, which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July. 
In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business. 
Let me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continue their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

I think a reflection of what we're seeing in the market, obviously, with interest rates rising. And so we're very pleased with what it means for our general account investing. We're obviously going to continue to see the portfolio yield rise as a result of that given that our roll-off has been now for the last couple of quarters also lower than our new money rates. I would also just remind everybody, though, that things can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter, just looking at the existing book of assets that we have, with the roll-off of maturity characteristics of those are. This was -- we look and see some big blocks that rolled off this past quarter, and there'll be things like that in the future as well. But I think what's important is to think about what the trend is. The trend is positive. We continue to see and expect our new money yield to increase and continue to expect to see widening spread over the existing portfolio, and that's obviously positive for net investment income."

And if you were to kind of step back more broadly, you've all heard about the workplace dynamics and how those are changing where we're seeing employees expecting more from their employers, and we're seeing employers looking for a variety of levers to attract, retain and engage their talent. And so that's a secular trend that's here to stay, and that's providing kind of tailwinds for the entire market.

And the other piece of this market that we kind of like is that you can also differentiate on many factors beyond price such as service and digital experiences to name a few. So some of these things, we believe, are going to provide kind of tailwinds to the overall market and keep the competitive landscape rationale.

It's a combination of rotating temporary assets into permanent assets and things like PRTs and other longer-term liabilities. And also just funding outflows and cash flow needs of the different businesses, whether it be surrenders or capital markets and the like. So that sort of sets the stage.

Now the sales momentum that began really last year has continued throughout this year. It is reflective of the resilience of our distribution channel, the diversification and the diversified product mix and the overall solidity and growth potential of the franchise in the region. Now the sales quarter -- the strong sales quarter was really across the region and across all channels with Chile and Brazil having the record quarter. Brazil actually I want to point out this is a growth story. We have grown twice as fast as the market. We are growing very well across all channels and all products. And just to give you an idea, this quarter, Brazil contributed to over 20% of the region's sales. So that overall flight to quality that I referenced last quarter is also evidenced by the strong persistencies that we're continuing to see and the robust sales of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.

And we've been able to do so over the last few years, and I think this is playing out very nicely. If you think about, I referenced voluntary benefits and some of the capabilities that we've introduced there, Japan in terms of digitizing our business and speed to market in terms of introducing new products. So we believe it's important to continue to make those types of investments to drive our competitive advantage going forward. Now when we did sort of establish the 12 3 target, obviously, it was also in a different environment if you consider the inflationary pressures that everyone is feeling at the moment. Yet I mean -- and again, I think this is credit to the sort of efficiency mindset that we've built here. We continue to be committed to achieving 12 3 for the year. And the last thing I would point to is that whereas we're having a record year when it comes to PRT, over $12 billion in new PRT deals, PRT premiums does not factor into our direct expense ratio, does not sort of help us from that standpoint yet.  There are obviously expenses associated with winning this business. So for all those reasons, we continue to believe that 12 3 is the right target for us."

I think third item is PE returns have been down the last couple of quarters. And then lastly, I called out in my opening remarks that we do get -- we have seen over the last couple of quarters some higher market-sensitive employee-related costs or corporate costs that we referred to.

Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter.

Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more, and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy, which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty. 
Looking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA, which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management. 
Turning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant-rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings. 
Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter. 
As you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market, which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500. Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy, but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates. 
For roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife. 
Shifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86%, which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. 
Execution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well, and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million, which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower-variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest-ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife. And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years. 
For Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower-variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules, which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant-currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products. 
2 weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage. 
In Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant-currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum. 
MetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal choose of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife. 
The discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIM's ESG capabilities with MIM's fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife. 
Moving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
In closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future. 
With that, I will turn things over to John."
185648,1803468955,2673963,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our ca",2002,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset-liability-management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected. 
In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings. 
The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in Life as a result of higher-earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain, which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean-reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions. 
On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant-currency basis. Lower-variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant-currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating Life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable items this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. 
With regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date, and we continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notable items were down 73% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, primarily due to lower-variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products, which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels. 
Latin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower-variable investment income and the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. 
EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant-currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21, which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower-variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset. 
Corporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower-variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23%, which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. 
On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71%, which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment. 
On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable-investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
Now let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest-value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30, which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July. 
In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower-variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business. 
Let me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.

This was -- we look and see some big blocks that rolled off this past quarter, and there'll be things like that in the future as well. But I think what's important is to think about what the trend is. The trend is positive. We continue to see and expect our new money yield to increase and continue to expect to see widening spread over the existing portfolio, and that's obviously positive for net investment income."

So I'll give a specific answer to your question. It may be also helpful to give you some broader context.  Both our mortality ratio as well as our nonmedical health ratio were clearly favorable in the quarter. But if you look at our results, historically, there's some seasonality to both of those ratios, and we'd expect them to somewhat pick up in the fourth quarter just from a seasonality perspective. In terms of the overall market, we remain extremely bullish about this market. And if you were to kind of step back more broadly, you've all heard about the workplace dynamics and how those are changing where we're seeing employees expecting more from their employers, and we're seeing employers looking for a variety of levers to attract, retain and engage their talent. And so that's a secular trend that's here to stay, and that's providing kind of tailwinds for the entire market. 
From a competitive perspective, I would say overall pricing is competitive but is also rational. We've talked about this in the past, the short nature of these products, Jimmy, really act as a natural check on any sustained irrational pricing. And the other piece of this market that we kind of like is that you can also differentiate on many factors beyond price such as service and digital experiences, to name a few. So some of these things, we believe, are going to provide kind of tailwinds to the overall market and keep the competitive landscape rationale. Now all of these are germane to the entire Group Benefits industry. They're particularly pertinent for us because we are the market leader in this industry across both our core and voluntary products. And that leadership and the strategic focus we've had is really giving us the scale to invest in a broad range of capabilities that we have that allows us to differentiate our offerings. So overall, pretty pleased with the performance, really pleased with the persistency and continue to see a competitive but rational market here."

And we have a very clear strategy in this market. We're focused on the jumbo end of the market.

Now the sales momentum that began really last year has continued throughout this year. It is reflective of the resilience of our distribution channel, the diversification and the diversified product mix and the overall solidity and growth potential of the franchise in the region. 
Now the sales quarter -- the strong sales quarter was really across the region and across all channels with Chile and Brazil having the record quarter. Brazil actually -- I want to point out this is a growth story. We have grown twice as fast as the market. We are growing very well across all channels and all products. And just to give you an idea, this quarter, Brazil contributed to over 20% of the region's sales.

So we believe it's important to continue to make those types of investments to drive our competitive advantage going forward. 
Now when we did sort of establish the 12.3% target, obviously, it was also in a different environment if you consider the inflationary pressures that everyone is feeling at the moment. Yet I mean -- and again, I think this is credit to the sort of efficiency mindset that we've built here. We continue to be committed to achieving 12.3% for the year. And the last thing I would point to is that whereas we're having a record year when it comes to PRT, over $12 billion in new PRT deals, PRT premiums does not factor into our direct expense ratio, does not sort of help us from that standpoint yet. There are obviously expenses associated with winning deals this business. So for all those reasons, we continue to believe that 12.3% is the right target for us."

I mean, volume is a dependent factor in answering that question. But right now, we feel very comfortable with being able to fund within the operating entities, what's needed to successfully grow this business."

First is just remember our guidance. We've been very consistent for several years in that. 12% is our expectation every year when we're going to planning, 3% a quarter. And I'd say that even now looking forward to the last part of your question, I wouldn't anticipate that changing. That's just how we think about this portfolio. The second thing is really our experience. And we've talked a lot about this, too, where in general, one of the things that we've always found attractive about the alternatives portfolio is that it does give us equity-like returns, but it gives it to us with less volatility and less extremes as compared to some other public market alternatives would. 
So that's why it's been very attractive to us. Now we did -- we talked a little bit several quarters over the last couple of years where we saw that relationship will be challenged. But when we look at the last couple of quarters, we do think that we're turning to sort of the historical norm in our expectations, which is, again, more muted in terms of volatility and extremes, but still giving us very attractive returns. So I don't think our outlook would change for it now, but we continue to like it for the reasons that we've mentioned."

We have more of these interest rate caps that are in the money that are starting to kind of add to the spread. Sequentially, it was down 2 basis points. In the second quarter, I called out that there were some excess returns in real estate that we expected to moderate, they did. So I'd say third quarter came in pretty much as expected. And then I think the thing going forward here is certainly based on the forward curve, which I just pulled up this morning of 3-month LIBOR, which is expected to rise to above 5% in the end of the year and beyond into next year. These caps will still be in place and will be additive to the spread. I'd say for fourth quarter, we'd expect spreads all else equal to grow by 5-plus bps."

First, in the first and third quarter, we typically have higher preferred stock dividends by about $30 million. Second, we are running a little heavier on interest costs on debt just because of the $1 billion of debt we raised in July. I think third item is PE returns have been down the last couple of quarters. And then lastly, I called out in my opening remarks that we do get -- we have seen over the last couple of quarters some higher market-sensitive employee-related costs or corporate costs that we referred to. And actually, that probably hit us by about 40 basis points on the expense ratio this quarter. So we are running a little heavy, as Michel commented before, we still expect to meet the 12.3% target despite this. And then I think we'll talk about outlook as we get into our February call. So hopefully, that helps."
