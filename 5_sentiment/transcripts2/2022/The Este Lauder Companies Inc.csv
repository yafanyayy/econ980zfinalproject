It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engi",2001,"Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engines of growth strategy showcased the benefit of its diversification. Every category, region and major channel expanded. We size the favorable dynamics of skin care, fragrance developed markets in the West, brick-and-mortar, and continue to prosper in the East with Chinese consumer as well as in global travel retail and global online. 
The flexibility we built into our business model over the last decade enable us to both allocate resources to attractive growth opportunities and effectively manage the impacts by increasing inflationary environment. Our advanced planning for the key shopping moments of 11.11 and holidays allowed us to overcome supply chain obstacles. 
For our second quarter, reported net sales grew 14%. Organic net sales rose 11%. Adjusted operating margin expanded, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15%. Today's results are all the more impressive compared to the prepandemic second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when we delivered record organic sales growth in our seasonally largest quarter. 
Despite the ensuing challenges of COVID-19, which escalated during the quarter with Omicron, we far exceeded the exceptional results of 2 years ago. Reported sales are 20% higher driven by organic sales growth and with every region now larger, and we are much more profitable. Our gains during the last 2 years reinforced our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. 
Moreover, our optimist in the opportunities of tomorrow remains incredibly strong, owing to the timeless desirability of our brands and our commitment during the pandemic to invest for the near and the long term. 
Our brand portfolio of large, scaling and developing brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth as consumer reward the quality of our trusted brand and hero products. In the second quarter, 11 brands achieved double-digit organic sales growth versus the prior year period. This broad-based trend is similar to the contribution in the first quarter despite a far tougher comparison. 
The momentum in our largest brands, Clinique, Estée Lauder, La Mer and M·A·C, continues as the hero franchises capitalize on innovation in product engagement and high-touch experiences and services to drive trial and repeat. La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care, while Estée Lauder and M·A·C drove makeup emerging renaissance. 
Our scaling and developing brands achieved excellent results. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty led fragrance and were among our top-performing brands, while Bobbi Brown grew strongly driven by skin care. Aveda and Bumble and bumble delivered accelerating sales growth in hair care as Too Faced and Smashbox rose double digits in makeup. 
Product innovation also served as a powerful catalyst for growth across our brand portfolio, contributing nearly 25% of sales. This level of contribution is notable in a quarter when holidays exclusives represent a larger mix of business and especially so in a challenged supply chain environment. 
La Mer fueled by its iconic heros on trend holiday merchandising and highly sought new dehydrating infused emotion led the company's sales growth. The brand excelled in every region and across major channels, cheered by its loyal consumer and embraced by new cohort of consumers, including more men. 
Clinique's skin care portfolio with its desirable innovation and hero franchises performed strongly. Its new Smart Clinical Retail Wrinkle Correcting Serum drove sales gains in North America, amplifying the brand's global momentum in the serum subcategory. Clinique Take The Day Off makeup remover saw a dramatic uptick in sales, evidence of makeup's emerging renaissance and the staying power of this [indiscernible] skin care product, which is recruiting a new generation of consumers. 
For makeup, the Estée Lauder brand is a driving force in the category emerging renaissance, with makeup sales for the brand already larger than 2 years ago. Estée Lauder Double Wear hero franchise delivered remarkable performance, while its Futurist foundation, which is an East to West product born of skinification of makeup trend, was very strong. 
Our fragrance portfolio continued to go from strength to strength, owing to the enduring sand-based ritual created in the pandemic and enhanced by innovation. Better online storytelling and expanded reach as consumers in the East embrace this category. Each of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle delivered strong double-digit growth in every region, demonstrating the idea of these brands around the world. 
Tom Ford Beauty exemplifies the benefits of a strategic focus on heros and innovation. Its Ombre Leather Parfum had a halo effect on the Ombre Parfum such that sales for the franchise doubled. In the third quarter, the brand is leveraging its global appeal with the flare of local relevance in the fragrance launch of Tom Ford Trilogy. 
Our growth engines also continue to diversify by region as we anticipate. Developed markets in the West performed especially well. North America executed with excellence to capture brick-and-mortar reopening trends and deliver a strong holiday across channels. Festive seasonal exclusive, including Estée Lauder blockbuster set and Aveda collaboration with [ Philip Lim ], proved highly sought. Indeed, our in-store and online activation and merchandising were incredibly successful, with brand.com posting a record Black Friday. 
Every category grew double digits organically in North America led by makeup where our brand paid trusted product with enticing innovation as social and professional user education increased. M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Too Faced produce engaging content and artist-led education to inspire consumers to size the joy and creativity of the category. 
Mainland China delivered high single-digit organic sales growth, an impressive result given the regional restrictions in the quarter, the pressured brick-and-mortar and makeup. 
Online sales rose double digits organically, even after having posted significant growth in the year ago period. For 11.11 on Tmall, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 flagship store in beauty for the second consecutive year as La Mer flagship store topped luxury beauty once more and Jo Malone London again led in prestige fragrance. On JD, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 flagship store in beauty in its first year. 
Skin care and fragrance grew double digits organically in Mainland China. Hero products and innovation excelled, driving new consumer acquisition and repeat purchases. Several brands expanded prestige beauty share in the quarter, including Estée Lauder, La Mer and Dr. Jart+. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity in the vibrant Asia/Pacific region and, most notably, in China. We are a few months from opening our new innovation center in Shanghai. Our aspiration for it are bold as we aim to meet and exceed the desires of Chinese consumers. The center is designed to enable end-to-end innovation from concept, from product packaging through development, scale-up and commercialization. I am pleased to share that the build-out of our state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo is also progressing very well, which is a testament to the amazing work of our global supply chain team amid the pandemic. Its first phase is complete, and we are on track to start limited production by the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. 
Our growth engines further diversified by channel as both online and brick-and-mortar prospered. Specialty-multi and department store contributed meaningfully, and freestanding store in the West performed very well on reopening. 
Traffic improved and complemented our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program to benefit productivity in brick-and-mortar. This channel trends are encouraging for the long term, even if tempered in this moment by Omicron. 
We continued to expand our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter to give consumer flexible and convenient shopping options for greater certainly for fulfillment. Buy online, pickup in-store offerings in the United States for M·A·C, Aveda, Jo Malone London and Le Labo are driving favorable average order value trends, and we are expanding the capability to more doors internationally, which holds great promise for the future. 
Our global online channel delivered excellent performance, with organic sales rising high single digit after having surged over 50% in the year ago period. Each of brand.com, third-party platform, pure play and retail.com contributed to growth. The drivers included higher levels of engagement for virtual try-on and tools for choosing shade and scent sophisticated assembly to drive trial and repeat a more and better live streaming. Indeed, in North America, La Mer generated the most sales from a live stream to date in the quarter. 
Our brands are innovating in social commerce on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and WeChat, among others. We gained momentum in this promising online ecosystem during the quarter. Too Faced leveraged an Instagram live shopping event to launch its new fragrance. Estée Lauder Double Wear followers on TikTok skyrocket with its latest campaign also driving brand awareness and affinity much higher. And Tom Ford Beauty creatively debuted its new flagship site on WeChat's mini program in China. Embedded with these outstanding results across categories, regions and channels is the progress we are making in social impact and sustainability. 
Since we spoke with you in November, we are pleased to have received several external recognition of our ESG efforts. We were named to Forbes inaugural list identifying the world's top female-friendly companies, leading the way to support women inside and outside the workforces. And for the fifth year in a row, we were named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. We were included in the CDP's Climate A List for the second consecutive year, which is a tribute to our deep commitment to climate action and to the highest level of transparency around our environmental interest. 
Last, MSCI recognized our progress toward our 2025 ESG goal in its recent upgrade of the company to an A rating. The company, our brands and our employees have a number of events and activations planned in honor of Black History Month, and we are continuing to focus on our racial equity commitments and the work of accomplishing our goals. 
As we embarked in -- on the second half of our fiscal year, our innovation pipeline is reached with newness, especially for sustainability. La Mer newly advanced The Treatment Lotion, which will be on country in March as a powerful upgrade inside and out, crafted using our unique green score methodology and housed in a new recyclable glass bottle made with 20% post-consumer recycled glass. This methodology, which was peer-reviewed in academic journal, Green Chemistry, during the quarter, evaluate ingredients and formulas throughout the lenses of human health, ecosystem health and the environment. This approach can be adopted, built upon and scaled by others across our industry to further advance sustainability. 
Estée Lauder is launching an all-new Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer created with innovations in formula and ingredients in a new recyclable glass jar -- bottle jar. Smashbox is introducing photo finished silkscreen primer collection fishery vegan formulas with a skin defending complex and instant makeup benefits. Lastly, [indiscernible] brands, The Ordinary, is welcoming back [indiscernible] acid 2% solution, posting a [indiscernible] of over 400,000 for the new formula. 
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance amid the accelerated volatility variability as well as supply chain challenges of the pandemic. This demonstrates that we have the competency to navigate complexity well. Our commitment to invest for the long term is of great importance in this moment as we benefit from the advancement we have made over the last few years in data analytics, technology, R&D and supply chain. These announced capabilities, combined with our strong portfolio of desirable brands, exceptional talent and more flexible resource allocation, are enabling us to realize the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy even in a difficult external environment. 
The grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employee in this still challenging moment knows no bounds. They are the embodiment of our company's strong culture. And to them, I extend my deepest gratitude. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

As you just heard, our momentum continued in our second quarter, with net sales growing 11% organically and 14% in total, led by a continued overall progression and recovery despite the volatility inherent across markets with a prolonged pandemic. 
We had a solid holiday performance across all of our regions. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 3 points to reported net sales growth, and the currency impact was neutral. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas rose 19% as holiday shoppers return to brick-and-mortar retail where we had an exciting array of gifting products and holiday activations in store. And even with more consumer shopping in stores, organic sales online also grew solidly in the Americas, with online representing more than 1/3 of sales in the region. Every market in the region contributed to sales growth this quarter, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 5 points to the total reported sales growth in the region. 
In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 13%. Growth was diverse and broad-based, with global travel retail as well as every market contributing. All channels grew, led by double-digit growth across brick-and-mortar as recovery continued in both developed and emerging markets in the region. 
Despite a strong performance during key shopping moments, organic sales online declined slightly, primarily driven by the U.K. due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which was more severely impacted by brick-and-mortar lockdowns. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 3 points to total reported sales growth in the region. 
Our global travel retail business grew low double digits. Travel restrictions have eased globally, and international passenger traffic continued to progressively improve, resulting in some stores reopening during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Travel retail continues to be led by Asia/Pacific where demand from Chinese consumers remain strong. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, organic net sales rose 5%. Most of the markets in the region grew, led by Mainland China and Australia, although we continue to see variability in COVID restrictions and retail traffic across markets. Sales grew across most major channels in the region, especially online, which benefited from the recent launch of 3 brands on JD.com. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 1 point to total reported sales growth in the region. 
From a category standpoint, organic net sales of fragrances grew 30% with double-digit increases across all regions. Exceptional double-digit increases from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and Kilian Paris reflected strong performances from hero products, new product launches and the continued growth of the Bath & Body and Home subcategories. 
Organic net sales in makeup rose 12% as consumers in the Americas and Europe responded to social media activation, holiday assortments and trends. Estée Lauder foundations continue to resonate very strongly with consumers, especially those in the Double Wear and Futurist franchises. M·A·C continued to drive the makeup renaissance with engaging, interactive campaigns throughout the quarter, like the special M·A·C trend Halloween report and solid holiday collections. Too Faced, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in the category this quarter. 
Organic net sales in skin care grew 7%, reflecting double-digit increases from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 4 percentage points to reported growth. 
Our organic net sales in hair care rose 18% as traffic in salons and stores improved, primarily in the Americas. Aveda's growth came mostly from holiday gifts and hero franchises and in online and freestanding stores, while Bumble and bumble focused on recruiting new consumers in the specialty-multi channel. 
Our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to last year. The benefits of strategic price increases and favorable currency more than offset the impact of higher makeup mix and lower gross margin on DECIEM products. Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter. 
Operating expenses decreased 140 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of selling expense and general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases in advertising and shipping costs, the latter due to both inflation and our direct-to-consumer online growth. 
Operating income rose 22% to $1.44 billion, and our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 25.9% in the quarter. Our tax rate at 21.4% continued at a more normal level this year versus the prior year, which was impacted by a onetime benefit associated with GILTI. 
Diluted EPS of $3.01 increased 15% compared to the prior year. For the 6 months, we generated $1.85 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.98 billion last year, which reflects both a return to more normalized working capital needs as well as increased inventory to mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruption given the ongoing global macro challenges. 
We significantly increased our capital investment to $459 million to support the construction of our new production facility near Tokyo as well as investments in our online business and other technology enhancements. And we returned $1.84 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, with an increase in our dividend rate occurring in the second quarter. 
So turning now to our outlook. We delivered an exceptional first half characterized by strong and diversified double-digit organic sales growth and disciplined cost management in the context of intermittent COVID disruptions, including the rise of the Omicron variant, high inflation and volatility. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance to reflect our expectation for a strong year despite the potential further spread of Omicron, supply chain challenges and increased inflationary pressures. 
Inflation and transportation and procurement is expected to impact our cost of goods in the second half. However, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts for the fiscal year. At this time, we expect pricing to add approximately 3.5 points of growth with the inclusion of the additional pricing actions we are taking during our second half. 
We are planning to support the continuation of the recovery with increased point-of-sale staffing as retail traffic continues to gradually improve. We are also planning to support key hero franchise launches in our third quarter from Estée Lauder, La Mer and Origins with increased marketing and advertising support. This investment will increase cost towards the latter part of the third quarter with more of the benefit to be realized in the fourth quarter. 
For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 10% to 13%. Based on rates of 1.146 for the euro, 1.357 for the pound and 6.399 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.43 and $7.58 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.07 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 of accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 17%. 
We expect organic sales for our third quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be negative by about 1 point. We expect third quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be $0.01 accretive to EPS, and the inclusion of DECIEM is not expected to be material. 
In closing, our results thus far clearly demonstrate the power of our diversified portfolio. Temporary softness in our Eastern markets driven by the pandemic was again offset by renewed growth in our Western markets. A resulting slight slowing of growth in skin care was offset by remarkable growth in fragrances. We continue to be choiceful about where we invest, and the flexibility we have built into our cost structure is helping us to mitigate some of the COVID-related disruptions and inflation while allowing us to continue to invest appropriately in our future growth. This agility, along with the resilience of our remarkable teams worldwide, gives us confidence that we can continue to manage through the temporary complexities caused by the prolonged pandemic by focusing clearly on our long-term strategy and executing against it with excellence. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

So we achieved a high single-digit growth in Mainland China this quarter, and where brick-and-mortar channels were impacted by COVID restrictions. But however, our online, which was not impacted by closures, grew double digits in quarter 2 and represented more than half of our business in China. Additionally, our business in China, travel retail, grew rapidly as well as retail. So we had 4 years of exceptional double-digit growth in China every quarter, and we expect this strong trend to have the potential to continue, frankly. And what you see in quarter 2 is just one specific segment, the brick-and-mortar, that affected by COVID restrictions went to single-digit growth, but the rest was all double-digit growth. So we remain absolutely excited by the potential of China. 
The long-term fundamentals that you were referring to in your question of the market remain really intact. There is the growing middle class continues to develop. The increasing per capita spending continues, at least in all the data we see on our products. And what the agility for us to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they buy, meaning online, travel retail, brick-and-mortar we are improving in all these elements. We are increasing the number of cities where we have brick-and-mortar. We are increasing the coverage online.

And I know there's a mix benefit, sales leverage, cost savings, and obviously, costs that have yet to fully returned to prepandemic levels. But is there a way to help us frame how we should think about operating leverage longer term?

In terms of the operating leverage that we've seen thus far, it has been terrific, obviously, in the first half. One of the things to keep in mind is our launch cadence in terms of when we actually have big product launches does affect quarter-to-quarter performance. But we certainly have continued to see some of the benefits of cost not returning. But brick-and-mortar is picking up. And clearly, we're continuing to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, our selling staff to support greater brick-and-mortar sales. 
So when you look at our full year, the overall margin expansion that is included in our guidance is around 90 basis points. So well ahead of our guidance in terms of 50 basis points a year from a long-term perspective. And that includes not only some of the costs not fully returning, but also includes some of the incremental costs related to managing this pandemic, some of the safety procedures we've had in place, some of the additional testing that we have in place, et cetera, that we are incurring. But we certainly expect continued growth from our higher margin channels and categories in the future that will continue to benefit us going forward."

First of all, we see our brands doing well in these new distributions. And again, these new distributions, particularly the target Ulta, the cool Sephora you are referring to, were designed to get new consumers, particularly sourcing consumers from us. And we see this working and our initial projections continue to be strong. 
However, I want to clarify that in quarter 2, a very small percentage of our growth was coming from those already. It's just the beginning. So the larger majority of our growth in quarter 2 was coming from just other organic activities that we are doing in the region. 
For example, we are strengthening and diversifying our product categories. Again, makeup renaissance is really getting also into new user education. So there are some fundamentals, which are improving for the post COVID. Then we are gaining share in many on the categories, subcategories, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone was doing outstanding. The skin care gained share. The Ordinary is an important part of building our overall market share in the region. 
And the other thing I could mention is our innovation and our marketing progress has been super strong. And the distribution choices that we have done has increased our abilities to source new consumers. But apart from the new brick-and-mortar choices, the online progress in North America is bringing a lot of new consumers, particularly consumers that before were not shopping online, and now they're shopping omnichannel. And that's why our omnichannel progress in North America is also playing a strong growth to sustain our growth now in the long term and continue sourcing new consumers. 
And finally, we are really executing with excellence. We are reinvesting fast in rebuilding the stores in the [indiscernible] way. We are investing, in fact, in improving our execution online, as we discussed also in previous calls. And so this combination of investing, but at the same time, thanks to our restructuring program, we are increasing productivity to brick-and-mortar as brick-and-mortar continues, we are making also our ability to leverage the growth in North America much stronger than what it was before. And that's why North America is not only successful, not only recovering strongly from the COVID, but also becoming a powerful engine of growth for the long term in this model of strategy, I should say, of multiple engine of growth."

And in terms of the margin, we still, in the second quarter, did have quite a few open positions as it relates to our selling staff and certainly hope to be able to close that gap in the third and the fourth quarter. The big difference in the second half of the year is we will be spending more advertising as a percent of sales in the second half of the year to support the launches that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And that will certainly impact particularly in Q3 the margin, and we expect to see the benefit of that in Q4, but really beyond. I mean these are our largest skin care brands, particularly Estée Lauder and La Mer and the hero franchise reformulations that we are doing on some of the products are really quite significant for us going forward. So that also should help the skin care category grow a bit. But again, skin care is largely affected by some of the shutdowns in high concentration skin care markets like the Asia/Pacific market. So certainly, as that market picks up, we expect that skin care will pick up as well. That, too, I would attribute to more of a temporary slowdown than anything else."

And so when you look at the first quarter versus the second quarter, while it was double digit, it was a bit less than in the first quarter, and that was a direct impact from the restrictions that occurred within China that impacted Hainan. We don't expect that level in the balance of the year. So we do expect to see travel retail pick up in the balance of the year. So Hainan continues to be a very strong driver of our travel retail business. And it is incredibly luxurious, and I know Fabrizio likes to talk about Hainan. So I will let him expand on that as well.

First of all, the travel retail globally was strong and was accelerating versus the previous quarter. And yes, the -- in Asia, there were some elements of acceleration. Yes, Hainan was very strong, as Tracey was saying, but I want also to underline that there was a strong growth in EMEA and North America, as I think Tracey said during her prepared remarks as well, which was linked to more traffic during holidays in these regions despite the Omicron variant growth. Now this is a very important sign because the reactivity of travel retail sales to traffic increase is extraordinary. And we have seen this in EMEA, for example, during the last quarter, quarter 2. So the first good news is the where traffic increase, travel retail respond very, very fast. And the other good news is what Tracey was speaking about the overall retail growth across despite some of the closures and some of the restrictions. 
The -- on Hainan, Hainan is becoming an extraordinary place, luxury, with amazing experiences. So it's probably one of the channels around the world, which is more equity building for the brand. So that's an important thing to underline. Also, in Hainan, there are many new retailers, which are opening. And so in Hainan, there is more distribution being built in several retailers, which are investing in the island. That's also something that will generate and will continue to generate expansion growth over time."

And so that's an important next step that will make our ability to work with China and our ability of our China team to get support for [indiscernible] their capabilities increased. So the organization is basically increasing our power of execution in China, the change -- the organization changes. 
In terms of the changes of senior leadership, they are all well planned retirement plans. The culture of the company is that our leaders share with us their plans in advance. We plan this with time and in a very professional way. And the very good news is that we have extraordinary succession plans already in place because all the succession of this position has been managed mostly with people that were ready for taking this position that were trained for years to take this position.

So media costs have gone, for sure. Live streaming activity has gone up, for sure. And we have shifted and adjusted our activity to make sure that our brands perform well within that environment. So it's a big planning event for the organization. We're really pleased with how our brands performed in general during 11.11 and have already started planning for next year's 11.11, which -- that's how long in advance we have to plan for it. 
So as it relates to the cadence of Q3 and Q4, we have spoken -- Olivia, I know you know for many years about the fact that we focus on the year. And we guide quarter-to-quarter, but we focus on managing the year. And in any given year, we might have very large product launches in the first quarter, or in the case of this year, in the third quarter. And so we do feel very positive about the future, obviously. And it is a rebalancing, to your point, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. 
The other thing that is embedded in our guidance for the third quarter, quite honestly, is the fact that Omicron is still impacting brick-and-mortar. We also have beauty of weather here in New York. But Omicron is impacting the environment and in brick-and-mortar. So we are seeing a slower recovery in the third quarter for brick-and-mortar than certainly we saw just a few months ago. And so we are cautious as it relates to that. 
And then I did mention that we do have a step up in -- continued step-up in some of our shipping costs and some of our supply chain costs as well. We have taken pricing. So the second half of the year, our pricing increase is 4%. It was 3% in the first half of the year since, hence, the average of 3.5%, which I spoke about in my prepared remarks. And we know we have agility going forward if this environment continues to take additional pricing as it warrants. But the combination of pricing and cost savings are really what allows us to invest for long-term sustainable growth in things like a new innovation center in Shanghai, the new plant that we are investing in, in Japan as well as the investments we're making and the other capabilities that Fabrizio spoke about and deliver a very, very strong year in terms of double-digit top line growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion."

But our promotions, as I was saying, is a lot about sampling and creating trial opportunities. So it's [ expensive ] rather than pricing. And then obviously, the retailers do what they believe is right for them in a given environment. 
The -- your question on travel retail, I think I have extreme high expectation for the long-term quality of travel retail growth. I think this is extremely promising channel. We have just seen the beginning of what will be a long-term powerful channel expansion for travel retail. And I spoke to these several other times, there are 2 drivers of travel retail, which are very important. One is the, obviously, the amount of travelers and what happens to travel, so the traffic. But the other is the conversion. So the amount of travelers that become shoppers. And the conversion of travelers into shoppers has been pre-COVID was still in the 10%, 15%, depending by region. So enormous expansion possibility of conversion are still in front of us. 
And the arrival of online in travel retail, which we call [ pretail ] today is very strong in Asia, but just the very, very beginning in any other region of the world. This is, we know, is a huge conversion driver because where this happened, we saw conversions of travelers into shoppers go from the 10%, 15% into the 30s. So you can imagine over time with expansion of the online possibility to buy pretail, that conversion will dramatically grow around the world of travel retail. 
When you have this perspective, the fact that the domestic duty free Hainan thing is going to be not cannibalized a lot when international travel will restart, as I explained in the previous answer. And so that the international traffic will come back. A lot of it will be net extra. 
And when you have in front of us the prove that I was quoting before then where, for example, in EMEA, we have seen some new -- some traffic coming back during the recent holidays, we saw great sales recovery. And so the responsiveness of travel retail to traffic coming back is very, very high. 
And so when you combine all these considerations and you put on top of it that we have a great travel retail team, not only with extraordinary commercial capabilities, but with great marketing capability, that the traveling stores -- the stores for travelers are becoming more and more an important driver for everything we do, a superimportant equity building opportunity for the brands. And so they're becoming an integral part of the creation of the overall consumer experience and the trial repeat dynamic that we've built. So I hope you realize why we do believe in travel retail as a long-term strategic channel."

It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engi",1999,"Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engines of growth strategy showcased the benefit of its diversification. Every category, region and major channel expanded. We size the favorable dynamics of skin care, fragrance developed markets in the West, brick-and-mortar, and continue to prosper in the East with Chinese consumer as well as in global travel retail and global online. 
The flexibility we built into our business model over the last decade enable us to both allocate resources to attractive growth opportunities and effectively manage the impacts by increasing inflationary environment. Our advanced planning for the key shopping moments of 11.11 and holidays allowed us to overcome supply chain obstacles. 
For our second quarter, reported net sales grew 14%. Organic net sales rose 11%. Adjusted operating margin expanded, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15%. Today's results are all the more impressive compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when we delivered record organic sales growth in our seasonally largest quarter. 
Despite the ensuing challenges of COVID-19, which escalated during the quarter with Omicron, we far exceeded the exceptional results of 2 years ago. Reported sales are 20% higher, driven by organic sales growth and with every region now larger, and we are much more profitable. Our gains during the last 2 years reinforced our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. Moreover, our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow remains incredibly strong, owing to the timeless desirability of our brands and our commitment during the pandemic to invest for the near and the long term. 
Our brand portfolio of large, scaling and developing brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth as consumer reward the quality of our trusted brand and hero products. In the second quarter, 11 brands achieved double-digit organic sales growth versus the prior year period. This broad-based trend is similar to the contribution in the first quarter despite a far tougher comparison. 
The momentum in our largest brands, Clinique, Estée Lauder, La Mer and M·A·C, continues as the hero franchises capitalize on innovation in product engagement and high-touch experiences and services to drive trial and repeat. La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care, while Estée Lauder and M·A·C drove makeup emerging renaissance. 
Our scaling and developing brands achieved excellent results. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty led fragrance and were among our top-performing brands, while Bobbi Brown grew strongly driven by skin care. Aveda and Bumble and bumble delivered accelerating sales growth in hair care as Too Faced and Smashbox rose double digits in makeup. 
Product innovation also served as a powerful catalyst for growth across our brand portfolio, contributing nearly 25% of sales. This level of contribution is notable in a quarter when holidays exclusives represent a larger mix of business and especially so in a challenged supply chain environment. 
La Mer fueled by its iconic heroes on trend holidays merchandising and highly-sought new The Hydrating Infused Emulsion led the company's sales growth. The brand excelled in every region and across major channels, cheered by its loyal consumer and embraced by new cohort of consumers, including more men. 
Clinique's skin care portfolio with its desirable innovation and hero franchises performed strongly. Its new Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum drove sales gains in North America, amplifying the brand's global momentum in the serum subcategory. Clinique Take The Day Off makeup remover saw a dramatic uptick in sales, evidence of makeup's emerging renaissance and the staying power of this crowd-favorite skin care product, which is recruiting a new generation of consumers. 
For makeup, the Estée Lauder brand is a driving force in the category emerging renaissance, with makeup sales for the brand already larger than 2 years ago. Estée Lauder Double Wear hero franchise delivered remarkable performance, while its Futurist foundation, which is an East to West product born of skinification of makeup trend, was very strong. 
Our fragrance portfolio continued to go from strength to strength, owing to the enduring sand-based ritual created in the pandemic and enhanced by innovation, better online storytelling and expanded reach as consumers in the East embrace this category. Each of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Frédéric Malle delivered strong double-digit growth in every region, demonstrating the allure of these brands around the world. 
Tom Ford Beauty exemplifies the benefits of a strategic focus on heroes and innovation. Its new Ombre Leather Parfum had a halo effect on the other perfumes such that sales for the franchise doubled. In the third quarter, the brand is leveraging its global appeal with a flare of local relevance in the fragrance launch of Tom Ford Rose Trilogy. 
Our growth engines also continue to diversify by region as we anticipate. Developed markets in the West performed especially well. North America executed with excellence to capture brick-and-mortar reopening trends and deliver a strong holiday across channels. Festive seasonal exclusive, including Estée Lauder Blockbuster Set and Aveda collaboration with Philip Lim proved highly sought. Indeed, our in-store and online activation and merchandising were incredibly successful, with brand.com posting a record Black Friday. 
Every category grew double digits organically in North America led by makeup where our brand paired trusted product with enticing innovation as social and professional user education increased. M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Too Faced produced engaging content and artist-led education to inspire consumers to size the joy and creativity of the category. Mainland China delivered high single-digit organic sales growth, an impressive result given the regional restrictions in the quarter, the pressured brick-and-mortar and makeup. 
Online sales rose double digits organically, even after having posted significant growth in the year ago period. For 11.11 on Tmall, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 flagship store in beauty for the second consecutive year as La Mer's flagship store topped luxury beauty once more and Jo Malone London again led in prestige fragrance. On JD, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 flagship store in beauty in its first year. 
Skin care and fragrance grew double digits organically in Mainland China. Hero products and innovation excelled, driving new consumer acquisition and repeat purchases. Several brands expanded prestige beauty share in the quarter, including Estée Lauder, La Mer and Dr. Jart+. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity in the vibrant Asia/Pacific region and, most notably, in China. We are a few months from opening our new innovation center in Shanghai. Our aspiration for it are bold as we aim to meet and exceed the desires of Chinese consumers. The center is designed to enable end-to-end innovation from concept, from product packaging through development, scale-up and commercialization. 
I am pleased to share that the build-out of our state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo is also progressing very well, which is a testament to the amazing work of our global supply chain team amid the pandemic. Its first phase is complete, and we are on track to start limited production by the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. 
Our growth engines further diversified by channel as both online and brick-and-mortar prospered. Specialty-multi and department store contributed meaningfully, and freestanding store in the West performed very well on reopening. 
Traffic improved and complemented our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program to benefit productivity in brick-and-mortar. This channel trends are encouraging for the long term, even if tempered in this moment by Omicron. 
We continued to expand our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter to give consumers flexible and convenient shopping options for greater certainly for fulfillment. Buy online, pickup in-store offerings in the United States for M·A·C, Aveda, Jo Malone London and Le Labo are driving favorable average order value trends, and we are expanding the capability to more doors internationally, which holds great promise for the future. 
Our global online channel delivered excellent performance, with organic sales rising high single digit after having surged over 50% in the year ago period. Each of brand.com, third-party platform, pure play and retail.com contributed to growth. The drivers included higher levels of engagement for virtual try-on and tools for choosing shade and scent, sophisticated assembly to drive trial and repeat, and more and better live streaming. Indeed, in North America, La Mer generated the most sales from a live stream to date in the quarter.  
Our brands are innovating in social commerce on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and WeChat, among others. We gained momentum in this promising online ecosystem during the quarter. Too Faced leveraged an Instagram live shopping event to launch its new fragrance. Estée Lauder Double Wear followers on TikTok skyrocketed with its latest campaign also driving brand awareness and affinity much higher. And Tom Ford Beauty creatively debuted its new flagship site on WeChat's mini program in China. Embedded with these outstanding results across categories, regions and channels is the progress we are making in social impact and sustainability. 
Since we spoke with you in November, we are pleased to have received several external recognition of our ESG efforts. We were named to Forbes inaugural list identifying the world's top female-friendly companies, leading the way to support women inside and outside the workforces. And for the fifth year in a row, we were named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. We were included in the CDP's Climate A List for the second consecutive year, which is a tribute to our deep commitment to climate action and to the highest level of transparency around our environmental interest. 
Last, MSCI recognized our progress toward our 2025 ESG goal in its recent upgrade of the company to an A rating. The company, our brands and our employees have a number of events and activations planned in honor of Black History Month, and we are continuing to focus on our racial equity commitments and the work of accomplishing our goals.
As we embarked in -- on the second half of our fiscal year, our innovation pipeline is rich with newness, especially for sustainability. La Mer newly advanced The Treatment Lotion, which will be on country in March as a powerful upgrade inside and out, crafted using our unique Green Score methodology and housed in a new recyclable glass bottle made with 20% post-consumer recycled glass. This methodology, which was peer-reviewed in academic journal, Green Chemistry, during the quarter, evaluate ingredients and formulas throughout the lenses of human health, ecosystem health and the environment. This approach can be adopted, built upon and scaled by others across our industry to further advance sustainability. 
Estée Lauder is launching an all-new Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer created with innovations in formula and ingredients in a new recyclable glass jar. Smashbox is introducing Photo Finish Silkscreen Primer collection featuring vegan formulas with a skin-defending complex and instant makeup benefits. Lastly, DECIEM vegan brands, The Ordinary, is welcoming back Salicylic Acid 2% Solution, boosting a win list of over 400,000 for the new formula. 
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance amid the accelerated volatility and variability as well as supply chain challenges of the pandemic. This demonstrates that we have the competency to navigate complexity well. Our commitment to invest for the long term is of great importance in this moment as we benefit from the advancement we have made over the last few years in data analytics, technology, R&D and supply chain. These announced capabilities, combined with our strong portfolio of desirable brands, exceptional talent and more flexible resource allocation, are enabling us to realize the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy even in a difficult external environment. 
The grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employee in this still-challenging moment knows no bounds. They are the embodiment of our company's strong culture. And to them, I extend my deepest gratitude. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

As you just heard, our momentum continued in our second quarter, with net sales growing 11% organically and 14% in total, led by a continued overall progression and recovery despite the volatility inherent across markets with a prolonged pandemic. We had a solid holiday performance across all of our regions. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 3 points to reported net sales growth, and the currency impact was neutral. 
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas rose 19% as holiday shoppers return to brick-and-mortar retail where we had an exciting array of gifting products and holiday activations in store. And even with more consumer shopping in stores, organic sales online also grew solidly in the Americas, with online representing more than 1/3 of sales in the region. Every market in the region contributed to sales growth this quarter, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 5 points to the total reported sales growth in the region. 
In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 13%. Growth was diverse and broad-based, with global travel retail as well as every market contributing. All channels grew, led by double-digit growth across brick-and-mortar as recovery continued in both developed and emerging markets in the region.  
Despite a strong performance during key shopping moments, organic sales online declined slightly, primarily driven by the U.K. due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which was more severely impacted by brick-and-mortar lockdowns. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 3 points to total reported sales growth in the region. 
Our global travel retail business grew low double digits. Travel restrictions have eased globally, and international passenger traffic continued to progressively improve, resulting in some stores reopening during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Travel retail continues to be led by Asia/Pacific where demand from Chinese consumers remain strong. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, organic net sales rose 5%. Most of the markets in the region grew, led by Mainland China and Australia, although we continue to see variability in COVID restrictions and retail traffic across markets. Sales grew across most major channels in the region, especially online, which benefited from the recent launch of 3 brands on JD.com. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 1 point to total reported sales growth in the region. 
From a category standpoint, organic net sales of fragrances grew 30% with double-digit increases across all regions. Exceptional double-digit increases from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS reflected strong performances from hero products, new product launches and the continued growth of the Bath & Body and Home subcategories. 
Organic net sales in makeup rose 12% as consumers in the Americas and Europe responded to social media activations, holiday assortments and trends. Estée Lauder foundations continue to resonate very strongly with consumers, especially those in the Double Wear and Futurist franchises. M·A·C continued to drive the makeup renaissance with engaging, interactive campaigns throughout the quarter, like the special M·A·C trend Halloween report and solid holiday collections. Too Faced, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in the category this quarter.  
Organic net sales in skin care grew 7%, reflecting double-digit increases from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 4 percentage points to reported growth. Our organic net sales in hair care rose 18% as traffic in salons and stores improved, primarily in the Americas. Aveda's growth came mostly from holiday gifts and hero franchises and in online and freestanding stores, while Bumble and bumble focused on recruiting new consumers in the specialty-multi channel. 
Our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to last year. The benefits of strategic price increases and favorable currency more than offset the impact of higher makeup mix and lower gross margin on DECIEM products. Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter. 
Operating expenses decreased 140 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of selling expense and general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases in advertising and shipping costs, the latter due to both inflation and our direct-to-consumer online growth. 
Operating income rose 22% to $1.44 billion, and our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 25.9% in the quarter. Our tax rate at 21.4% continued at a more normal level this year versus the prior year, which was impacted by a onetime benefit associated with GILTI. 
Diluted EPS of $3.01 increased 15% compared to the prior year. For the 6 months, we generated $1.85 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.98 billion last year, which reflects both a return to more normalized working capital needs as well as increased inventory to mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruption given the ongoing global macro challenges. 
We significantly increased our capital investment to $459 million to support the construction of our new production facility near Tokyo as well as investments in our online business and other technology enhancements. And we returned $1.84 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, with an increase in our dividend rate occurring in the second quarter. 
So turning now to our outlook. We delivered an exceptional first half characterized by strong and diversified double-digit organic sales growth and disciplined cost management in the context of intermittent COVID disruptions, including the rise of the Omicron variant, high inflation and volatility. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance to reflect our expectation for a strong year despite the potential further spread of Omicron, supply chain challenges and increased inflationary pressures. 
Inflation and transportation and procurement is expected to impact our cost of goods in the second half. However, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts for the fiscal year. At this time, we expect pricing to add approximately 3.5 points of growth with the inclusion of the additional pricing actions we are taking during our second half.  
We are planning to support the continuation of the recovery with increased point-of-sale staffing as retail traffic continues to gradually improve. We are also planning to support key hero franchise launches in our third quarter from Estée Lauder, La Mer and Origins with increased marketing and advertising support. This investment will increase cost towards the latter part of the third quarter with more of the benefit to be realized in the fourth quarter. 
For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 10% to 13%. Based on rates of 1.146 for the euro, 1.357 for the pound and 6.399 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.43 and $7.58 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.07 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 of accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 17%. 
We expect organic sales for our third quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be negative by about 1 point. We expect third quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be $0.01 accretive to EPS, and the inclusion of DECIEM is not expected to be material. 
In closing, our results thus far clearly demonstrate the power of our diversified portfolio. Temporary softness in our Eastern markets driven by the pandemic was again offset by renewed growth in our Western markets. A resulting slight slowing of growth in skin care was offset by remarkable growth in fragrances. 
We continue to be choiceful about where we invest, and the flexibility we have built into our cost structure is helping us to mitigate some of the COVID-related disruptions and inflation while allowing us to continue to invest appropriately in our future growth. This agility, along with the resilience of our remarkable teams worldwide, gives us confidence that we can continue to manage through the temporary complexities caused by the prolonged pandemic by focusing clearly on our long-term strategy and executing against it with excellence. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

So we achieved a high single-digit growth in Mainland China this quarter and where brick-and-mortar channels were impacted by COVID restrictions. But however, our online, which was not impacted by closures, grew double digits in quarter 2 and represented more than half of our business in China. Additionally, our business in China travel retail grew rapidly as well as retail. So we had 4 years of exceptional double-digit growth in China every quarter, and we expect this strong trend to have the potential to continue, frankly. And what you see in quarter 2 is just one specific segment, the brick-and-mortar, that affected by COVID restrictions, went to single-digit growth. But the rest was all double-digit growth, so we remain absolutely excited by the potential of China. 
The long-term fundamentals that you were referring to in your question of the market remain really intact. There is the growing middle class, continues to develop. The increasing per capita spending continues, at least in all the data we see on our products. And the agility for us to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they buy, meaning online, travel retail, brick-and-mortar, we are improving in all these elements. We are increasing the number of cities where we have brick-and-mortar. We are increasing the coverage online. 
You heard in the prepared remarks, our reference to JD and the incredible success in JD where Estée Lauder is already #1 shopping -- shop in there, and the travel retail, where we continue to be very strong. Super excited by Hainan and the huge quality expression of our brands that is happening there. So very strong Chinese consumers trends and now we're looking at a great, great future."

It's just, when I take a step back and look at the first half of this year and compare it to pre-COVID levels, it's just been very impressive what you've been able to do there. And I know there's a mix benefit, sales leverage, cost savings, and obviously, costs that have yet to fully return to pre-pandemic levels. But is there a way to help us frame how we should think about the operating leverage longer term? Is there a way to kind of disaggregate the benefit you've seen year-to-date that you believe has greater staying power versus what you might expect to really come back as we return to, I guess, ""a normal environment""?"

In terms of the operating leverage that we've seen thus far, it has been terrific, obviously, in the first half. One of the things to keep in mind is our launch cadence in terms of when we actually have big product launches does affect quarter-to-quarter performance. But we certainly have continued to see some of the benefits of cost not returning. But brick-and-mortar is picking up. And clearly, we're continuing to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, our selling staff to support greater brick-and-mortar sales. 
So when you look at our full year, the overall margin expansion that is included in our guidance is around 90 basis points, so well ahead of our guidance in terms of 50 basis points a year from a long-term perspective. 
And that includes not only some of the costs not fully returning, but also includes some of the incremental costs related to managing this pandemic, some of the safety procedures we've had in place, some of the additional testing that we have in place, et cetera, that we are incurring. But we certainly expect continued growth from our higher margin channels and categories in the future that will continue to benefit us going forward."

First of all, we see our brands doing well in these new distributions. And again, these new distributions, particularly the target Ulta, the cool Sephora that you are referring to, were designed to get new consumers, particularly sourcing consumers from us. And we see this working and our initial projections continue to be strong. 
However, I want to clarify that in quarter 2, a very small percentage of our growth was coming from those already. It's just the beginning. So the larger majority of our growth in quarter 2 was coming from just other organic activities that we are doing in the region. 
For example, we are strengthening and diversifying our product categories. Again, makeup renaissance is really getting also into new user education. So there are some fundamentals, which are improving for the post COVID. Then we are gaining share in many on the categories, subcategories, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone was doing outstanding. The skin care gained share. The Ordinary is an important part of building our overall market share in the region. 
And the other thing I could mention is our innovation and our marketing progress has been super strong. And the distribution choices that we have done has increased our abilities to source new consumers. But apart from the new brick-and-mortar choices, the online progress in North America is bringing a lot of new consumers, particularly consumers that before were not shopping online, and now they're shopping omnichannel. And that's why our omnichannel progress in North America is also playing a strong growth to sustain our growth now in the long term and continue sourcing new consumers. 
And finally, we are really executing with excellence. We are reinvesting fast in rebuilding the stores in their [ core ] way. We are investing, in fact, in improving our execution online, as we discussed also in previous calls. And so this combination of investing, but at the same time, thanks to our restructuring program, we are increasing productivity to brick-and-mortar as brick-and-mortar continues, we are making also our ability to leverage the growth in North America much stronger than what it was before. And that's why North America is not only successful, not only recovering strongly from the COVID, but also becoming a powerful engine of growth for the long term in this model or strategy, I should say, of multiple engine of growth."

And in terms of the margin, we still, in the second quarter, did have quite a few open positions as it relates to our selling staff and certainly hope to be able to close that gap in the third and the fourth quarter. The big difference in the second half of the year is we will be spending more advertising as a percent of sales in the second half of the year to support the launches that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And that will certainly impact particularly in Q3 the margin, and we expect to see the benefit of that in Q4, but really beyond. 
I mean these are our largest skin care brands, particularly Estée Lauder and La Mer and the hero franchise reformulations that we are doing on some of the products are really quite significant for us going forward. So that also should help the skin care category grow a bit. But again, skin care is largely affected by some of the shutdowns in high concentration skin care markets like the Asia/Pacific market. So certainly, as that market picks up, we expect that skin care will pick up as well. That, too, I would attribute to more of a temporary slowdown than anything else."

And then, I guess, just bigger picture on these broader channels, just how this is developing in Asia, right?

For the first quarter, actually, we had greater double-digit growth in travel retail. And so when you look at the first quarter versus the second quarter, while it was double digit, it was a bit less than in the first quarter, and that was a direct impact from the restrictions that occurred within China that impacted Hainan. 
We don't expect that level in the balance of the year. So we do expect to see travel retail pick up in the balance of the year. So Hainan continues to be a very strong driver of our travel retail business. And it is incredibly luxurious, and I know Fabrizio likes to talk about Hainan. So I will let him expand on that as well. But we continue to expand our presence in Hainan and continue to see fantastic, fantastic consumer receptivity to our brands in Hainan."

So to speak to the travel retail trends, first of all, the travel retail globally was strong and was accelerating versus the previous quarter. And yes, the -- in Asia, there were some elements of acceleration. Yes, Hainan was very strong, as Tracey was saying, but I want also to underline that there was a strong growth in EMEA and North America, as I think Tracey said during her prepared remarks as well, which was linked to more traffic during holidays in these regions despite the Omicron variant growth. Now this is a very important sign because the reactivity of travel retail sales to traffic increase is extraordinary. And we have seen this in EMEA, for example, during the last quarter, quarter 2. So the first good news is the -- where traffic increased, travel retail respond very, very fast. And the other good news is what Tracey was speaking about the overall retail growth across despite some of the closures and some of the restrictions. 
The -- on Hainan, Hainan is becoming an extraordinary place, luxury, with amazing experiences. So it's probably one of the channels around the world, which is more equity building for the brand. So that's an important thing to underline. Also, in Hainan, there are many new retailers which are opening. And so in Hainan, there is more distribution being built in several retailers, which are investing in the island. That's also something that will generate and will continue to generate expansion growth over time."

And so that's an important next steps that will make our ability to work with China and our ability of our China team to get support for our growth increase. So the organization is basically increasing our power of execution in China, the change -- the organization changes. 
In terms of the changes of senior leadership, they are all well planned retirement plans. The culture of the company is that our leaders share with us their plans in advance. We plan this with time and in a very professional way. And the very good news is that we have extraordinary succession plans already in place because all the succession of this position has been managed mostly with people that were ready for taking this position that were trained for years to take this position. So I think you should take out of this the strength of our succession planning. That is also the reflection of our culture. 
And the culture is more and more collaborative cultures, which is united by our compass work, by our strategy work and our execution. Collaborative execution is the result of very clear common goals and very uniting reward systems to make this organization working team.

And we've spoken in the past about how we do promotion as it relates to 11.11. A lot of it is done with samples. And certainly, increasingly, there is more and more media support for 11.11 as well. It is a big opportunity for us as we view it to recruit new consumers, and it is one of the biggest events that we have during the course of the year to -- in a concentrated period of time, have the ability to recruit new consumers, which then we retain -- work to retain over the balance of the future years. 
So media costs have gone for sure. Live streaming activity has gone up for sure. And we have shifted and adjusted our activity to make sure that our brands perform well within that environment. So it's a big planning event for the organization. We're really pleased with how our brands performed in general during 11.11 and have already started planning for next year's 11.11, which -- that's how long in advance we have to plan for it. 
So as it relates to the cadence of Q3 and Q4, we have spoken -- Olivia, I know that you know for many years about the fact that we focus on the year. And we guide quarter-to-quarter, but we focus on managing the year. And in any given year, we might have very large product launches in the first quarter or in the case of this year, in the third quarter. And so we do feel very positive about the future, obviously. And it is a rebalancing, to your point, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. 
The other thing that is embedded in our guidance for the third quarter, quite honestly, is the fact that Omicron is still impacting brick-and-mortar. We also have beauty of weather here in New York. But Omicron is impacting the environment and in brick-and-mortar. So we are seeing a slower recovery in the third quarter for brick-and-mortar than certainly we saw just a few months ago. And so we are cautious as it relates to that. 
And then I did mention that we do have a step up in -- continued step up in some of our shipping costs and some of our supply chain costs as well. We have taken pricing. So the second half of the year, our pricing increase is 4%. It was 3% in the first half of the year since, hence, the average of 3.5%, which I spoke about in my prepared remarks. And we know we have agility going forward if this environment continues to take additional pricing as it warrants. 
But the combination of pricing and cost savings are really what allows us to invest for long-term sustainable growth in things like a new innovation center in Shanghai, the new plant that we are investing in, in Japan as well as the investments we're making and the other capabilities that Fabrizio spoke about and deliver a very, very strong year in terms of double-digit top line growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion."

Thank you, Tracey, to clarify that retailers pricing a promotion, they decide. We don't decide. But our promotions, as I was saying, is a lot about sampling and creating trial opportunities.

But our promotions, as I was saying, is a lot about sampling and creating trial opportunities. So it's expansive rather than pricing. And then obviously, the retailers do what they believe is right for them in a given environment. 
The -- your question on travel retail, I think I have extreme high expectation for the long-term quality of travel retail growth. I think this is extremely promising channel. We have just seen the beginning of what will be a long-term powerful channel expansion for travel retail. And I spoke to these several other times, there are 2 drivers of travel retail, which are very important. One is the, obviously, the amount of travelers and what happens to travel, so the traffic. But the other is the conversion. So the amount of travelers that become shoppers. And the conversion of travelers into shoppers has been pre-COVID, was still in the 10%, 15%, depending by region. So enormous expansion possibility of conversion are still in front of us. 
And the arrival of online in travel retail, which we call pretail, today, is very strong in Asia, but just at the very, very beginning in any other region of the world, this is, we know, is a huge conversion driver. Because where this happened, we saw conversions of travelers into shoppers go from the 10%, 15% into the 30s. So you can imagine, over time and with expansion of the online possibility to buy pretail, that conversion will dramatically grow around the world of travel retail. 
When you add to this perspective the fact that the domestic duty free Hainan thing is going to be not cannibalized a lot when international travel will restart, as I explained in the previous answer, and so that the international traffic will come back, a lot of it will be net extra. And when you have in front of us the proof that I was quoting before then where, for example, in EMEA, we have seen some new -- some traffic coming back during the recent holidays, we saw great sales recovery. And so the responsiveness of travel retail to traffic coming back is very, very high. 
And so when you combine all these considerations and you put on top of it that we have a great travel retail team, not only with extraordinary commercial capabilities, but with great marketing capability, that the traveling stores -- the stores for travelers are becoming more and more an important driver for everything we do, a super important equity-building opportunity for the brands. And so they're becoming an integral part of the creation of the overall consumer experience and the trial repeat dynamic that we've built. So I hope you realize why we do believe in travel retail as a long-term strategic channel."

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we delivered organic sales growth of 9%, in line with our guidance despite the acceleration of temporary COVID-19 restriction in China in March. We exercised cost discipline as volatility increased, and our adjusted operating margin expanded, leading to stronger-than-expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 17%. 
Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to amplify the engines of the moment amid intensified macro environment, with sales rising organically across both brick-and-mortar and online. Every category grew organically, led by fragrances' outstanding performance. 11 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth and further demonstrated our diversified drivers. Consumer demand remains robust even in this inflationary environment. 
Our largest brands provided highly sought-after, M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique each delivered double-digit growth in makeup, fueling the category renaissance while La Mer thrived in skin care. Four of our scaling brands resonated strongly with consumers as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Aveda and Bobbi Brown each rose double digits. Among our developing brands, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Bumble and bumble each achieved outsized growth and showcased their promise. 
Our sales rose double digit organically in the Americas and EMEA. We capitalize on reopening to translate improving brick-and-mortar traffic trends into outstanding sales growth, owing to our high-touch services, breakthrough innovation, hero franchises and operational excellence. 
Our freestanding stores delivered exceptional performance benefiting from fleet optimization and expanded omnichannel capabilities and complement the strengths in specialty multi. We are managing the ongoing complexities from the invasion of Ukraine as well as the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, which impacted performance in Asia Pacific in the quarter. 
In Mainland China, organic sales fell mid-single-digit as 25% growth online was offset by a steep decline in brick-and-mortar. After a strong February, in Mainland China, traffic slowed more sharply in March to pressure brick-and-mortar sales. Additionally, for us, the distribution centers for our Mainland China business are in Shanghai and operated with limited capacity. Tourism to Hainan highland was also curtailed in March after a vibrant start of the quarter. There is no doubt that these current limitations in China will prove to be transitory, although there will be a far greater impact on our results in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter, as Tracey will discuss. Looking ahead, we are confident in the resilience of the Chinese consumers and the untapped opportunity driving our investments in the market. We expect a reacceleration of growth when this moment of COVID abates. 
Let me share the progress we made during the third quarter to drive these strong results and advance our long-term ambitions for our multiple engine of growth strategy. Innovation excelled to reach nearly 30% of sales. We continue to elevate our ability to leverage data analytics with our best-in-class creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends. The breadth of our innovation wins was far-reaching and benefited every category in skincare, La Mer upgraded the treatment lotion sort as the brand doubled down on this coveted East-West product, increasing the skin recharging Miracle Broad and transitioning to a recyclable luxurious glass bottle that contains 20% post-consumer recycled content. 
In Asia Pacific, consumer gravitated to the new serum strengths and anti-aging benefits, while in the Americas, educating on the benefits of hydration and energy proved impactful with consumers, demonstrating our expertise in serving multiple needs with one product and communicating with the appropriate local relevance. 
For makeup, M·A·C sought to grow its mascara base, especially across Gen Z, younger millennial and multi-ethnic consumers and created MACStack Mascara. With breakthrough technology, the stacks and builds the last look. MACStack went viral on TikTok, having now amassed over 153 million views, and its sales far exceeded our expectations in the quarter. 
Tom Ford Beauty new private blend rose fragrances, feature locally relevant nodes, where Rose De Chine  feature Chinese golden and Rose D’Amalfi includes Italian bergamot. This launch drove exceptional results globally, including China, where the brand had a very successful Valentine's Day. 
Lastly, haircare, Aveda launched botanical retail strengthening overnight serum, disrupting the category by creating our first overnight serum that builds new hair bonds while you sleep. The products sold key consumer pain points with quick-absorbing technology by leveraging a serum-based formula. Encouragingly, the product quickly rose to being the top-selling product in freestanding store and sold out on brand.com. 
We are excited to build upon this momentum with our new innovation center in Shanghai opens later this calendar year. This important investment in China will significantly increase our ability to serve the Chinese and Asian consumers with locally relevant and inspired innovation. Also, the new center will further enable our East to West innovation mindset, supporting the creation of more successes like La Mer's The Treatment Lotion. 
Looking at our growth engines by category, the strategic decision to pivot our fragrance portfolio to luxury and artisanal is benefit both top line growth and profitability. Fragrances performance in the third quarter was super with sales increasing 31% organically. Impressively, sales exceeded the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal year 2019 by nearly 50% on a reported basis. Jo Malone and Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Edition DePasanFederic, each delivered double-digit sales growth, and Estée Lauder brand complemented these strengths with its well-received new luxury collection. As consumers around the world increasingly express their individuality with scent, these brands are delivering outstanding results. with strong double-digit growth fiscal year-to-date in every region, driven by demand across channels from brick-and-mortar to online and travel retail. There freestanding doors are driving omnichannel experiences, while their online businesses have been transformed during the pandemic. 
And this fragrance brands are also contributing to our sustainability goals, with refillable packaging being a compelling element of the value proposition for Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS. We are also thrilled to announce that during the third quarter, Le Labo became BCR-certified, making it the first major fragrance brand and first within our company to receive this certification, indicating a high level of commitment to sustainability and impact. 
Turning to makeup. It was on this call a year ago that we introduced our expectation for makeup renaissance, anticipating it would gradually evolve market by market as social and professional use educations began to resume. We envisioned the category would experience a recovery driven by both restocking as well as a renaissance rooted in a renewed passion for the joy and creativity of makeup after a difficult time. 
Even with the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants, the makeup renaissance has delivered very favorable trends and offers great promise for the future. As usual location expanded in certain markets upon reopening in the third quarter, makeup once again delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the Americas and EMEA. M·A·C and Clinique's makeup sales growth accelerated sequentially, while Estée Lauder and La Mer businesses in the category are already ahead of pre pandemic levels. 
While brands have been meticulous in executing their merchandising and innovation strategy for the renaissance, we invested to create the omni artist with meeting the consumers in innovative ways across brick-and-mortar and online to educate inspire looks and offer the best in personalized high-touch services. 
M·A·C has been superb in this regard. So, too, has Bobbi Brown with events like live streams from the largest mall in Manchester, England to as per group classes to in China to one-to-one Zoom sessions in the U.S. 
Moving to hair care, Aveda Bumble and bumble have reignited growth engines to contribute to the diversified category growth that we expected for fiscal year 2022. Impressively, even as these brands grew sales strong double digits in brick-and-mortar or reopening during the third quarter, they also achieved mid-single-digit online growth. 
Lastly, while skin care was pressured by COVID restrictions in the East, the bright spots were still many. In the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies across many long-term growth drivers  from luxury to prestige. La Mer performance was extraordinary, with sales rising strong double digits. As I discussed, it upgrades The Treatment Lotion sort creating a high effect on the still new hydrate infused emotion, while its heroes were highly sought after. With desirable innovation and coveted icons, La Mer is welcoming new consumers, earning their trust and traded them up as its ultra Genaissance de la Mer franchise is booming. While our high-end prestige skin care thrives with La Mer and Estée Lauder Bobbi Brown is prospering in the heart of the category, thanks to its strategic focus on treasured heroes like vitamin-enriched face base. 
We are also laser focused on entry-level prestige to reach new consumers, notably with Vaseem The Ordinary as the brand amplifies its heroes to drive repeat with its ingredient-led regiment-based approach. After the quarter closed, Des announced it will be refining its brand portfolio to focus resources on the compelling opportunity we foresee for and New York. 
During the quarter, we also improved upon the fundamentals of consumer acquisitions, engagement and high-touch services, positioning us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. Our partnership with TikTok expanded, and we are piloting new innovations on the platform to be at the forefront of social commerce innovations. In the U.S., several of our brands launched storefronts on TikTok, similarly linking to brand.com. Brands also expanded their capabilities with Instagram Shopping and launched category powered lenses on Snapchat similarly linked to brand.com. Clinique realized favorable engagement trends on TikTok and Instagram, and it featured its back in stock coveted Black Honey Lipstick and strong recruitment growth with new advertising for 100 hour featuring the made for social phase of adventure campaign. 
The Estée Lauder brand entered the metaverse as connecting with our consumer wherever they are is paramount, and we are excited to be testing and learning in this new ecosystem. Estée Lauder was the exclusive beauty brand partner of the Centraland Metaverse Fashion Week, the first ever large virtual fashion week in an unchanged metaverse. 
Around the world, our brands are increasingly leveraging new campaign management tools to tailor communication and drive repeat to both reengage with consumers and foster relationships with new consumers. We are realizing increased reactivation and repeat purchase rate from the U.K. to France, Australia and beyond. 
In closing, we delivered very strong performance amid the accelerating headwinds during the third quarter. We also made excellent progress advancing the long-term drivers of our multiple engine of growth strategy. These results in this progress are due to the tremendous accomplishments of our employees around the world to whom I extend my deepest thanks as they continue to manage complex situation with grace and ingenuity. 
Moreover, I'm incredibly inspired by our employees' compassion for each other. Last week marked the 2-year anniversary of the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund. The fund was created in response to employee increasing desire to support one another in times of need. Since inception, over $10 million has been distributed to employees globally from donations and company matches. 
Looking ahead, while we are lowering our expectation for the fourth quarter, given the impact of the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, we expect to deliver another record year in fiscal year 2022. We remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our business. This quarter proved the vibrancy of prestige beauty, its resiliency even in a difficult macro environment and the strength of our trusted brands and product innovations as markets sequentially recover from the prolonged pandemic. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

Our third quarter net sales grew 9% organically despite the increased complexity and volatility caused by the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was broad-based across categories and markets as most regions across the world continue to recover and grow, albeit at different rates. 
Sales in specialty-multi and freestanding retail stores led growth and online sales rose mid-single-digits. The inclusion of sales from the late May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 2 points to reported net sales growth, and currency was a headwind of approximately 1 point. 
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18%. Growth was realized across most markets, channels and brands. Market growth was led by both the recovery in the largest Western markets as well as in key emerging markets like Turkey and India. All brick-and-mortar channels grew, led by double-digit growth in department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi stores. Organic sales online declined when compared to the prior year quarter where online sales benefited both from the pandemic-driven store closures and reduced store traffic. All product categories and most brands grew in the region, led by La Mer, Jo Malone London and M·A·C. 
Our global travel retail business again grew double digits despite the challenges that arose during the quarter. Asia is the largest region for our travel retail business, and sales in the key markets of China and Korea were very robust at retail for most of the quarter. However, there was a precipitous decline in Chinese travel in March as restrictions to contain COVID were increased in China. We continue to see a sharp increase in travel retail sales outside of Asia as traffic increased throughout Europe and the Americas. 
Net sales in the Americas rose 11% organically, with all markets contributing to growth. All product categories grew with particular strength in makeup and hair care. The 2 largest prestige makeup brands in the U.S., M·A·C and Clinique, outpaced overall category growth to gain share. Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford Beauty also gained share helping to further drive the makeup renaissance as more consumers continued their return to the workplace and resumed more social occasions. 
Our sales in specialty-multi and in freestanding retail stores strongly outperformed this quarter as consumers return to stores for shopping and services. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth, and favorable currency movement contributed 1 point to sales growth in the region. 
In our Asia Pacific region, organic net sales fell 4%, driven entirely by Greater China. For the quarter, net sales in Mainland China declined mid-single-digits. Following a strong Lunar New Year in February, sales declined in March as additional COVID restrictions impacted many cities, most notably Shanghai, where our distribution centers serving the entire country are located. The restriction sharply curtailed productivity at these facilities, affecting our ability to both receive product being shipped into the country and to fulfill demand across all channels of distribution. However, shipments should begin to normalize as restrictions ease. 
Net sales in Hong Kong also declined throughout the quarter as the city took increasing measures to contain the virus. Partially offsetting these decreases with strong net sales growth in most other markets, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Online sales in Asia Pacific grew strong double digits as we continue to expand our brand reach across new platforms. 
Our gross margin improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic price increases of approximately 4% combined with favorable currency and reduced obsolescence contributed to the increase in gross margin as well as the favorable impact of anniversary last year's under absorption of manufacturing overhead. This more than offset the impact of increased inflationary pressures in our supply chain, mainly in logistics and materials and increasing start-up costs for our new plant in Japan. 
Operating expenses decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of general and administrative expense was partially offset by increased shipping costs related to higher freight rates and more air shipments on increased sales volume. Additionally, as cities throughout China began tightening restrictions and traffic to Hainan slowed, we reduced certain expenses to correspond with slower retail traffic. 
Operating income rose 15% to $917 million, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.6% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.90 increased 17% compared to the prior year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $216 million of impairment to goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to Dr. Jart+, reflecting forecast for slower-than-expected growth in China and travel retail. We continue to believe in the growth potential of the brand, which has been impacted by the temporary COVID disruptions in Asia given its strong growth prior to the start of the pandemic as well as the growth seen in recovering markets. 
For the 9 months, we generated $1.97 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2.78 billion last year, which reflects investments in working capital to both support growth and mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruptions as well as higher cash paid for taxes. This was partially offset by higher net income. We significantly increased our capital investment to $658 million to support the ongoing construction of our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. Investments in our innovation center in Shanghai as well as investments in online and technology enhancements. And we returned $2.62 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
Turning now to our outlook. As you have heard and are aware, there have been 2 significant headwinds that have emerged since we last gave guidance in early February, increased COVID-related restrictions in China also impacting Hainan and the invasion of Ukraine. Our current guidance for the balance of this year reflects continued momentum in the Americas and EMEA excluding travel retail as well as the continuation of lockdowns and corresponding distribution constraints in China through at least the first half of our fourth quarter. While we expect continued growth at retail in both Mainland China and Hainan, the severity of the distribution constraints we are experiencing are expected to result in a meaningful decline in net sales for these areas for the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to fulfill the majority of our orders in time for our planned 6.18 activities. The elimination of sales in Russia and Ukraine has reduced expected fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 120 basis points. 
At the same time, we delivered outstanding results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, with greater diversification of our growth drivers. Our geographic diversity is a tremendous asset, and we expect our multiple engines of growth to continue, including the ongoing recovery of the Americas, Western Europe and most markets in Asia. We expect to also deliver strong margin improvement for the year. The benefit of our strategic pricing actions this year, along with agility and our cost management are helping to offset the initial effects of increasing inflation throughout this fiscal year. We plan to continue to invest in the recovery, support innovation and assuming current disruptions abate, fuel upcoming key shopping moments in the quarter, like 6.18 in China and Mother's Day. 
With these assumptions as our backdrop for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are now forecasted to grow 5% to 7%. This range excludes approximately 2 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.05 and $7.15 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. These expectations imply margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points, including dilution of 40 basis points from DECIEM this year. 
In closing, we managed extremely well through an increasingly complex environment in our third quarter, and these complexities are expected to meaningfully impact our fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to expect to deliver a very strong year with above-average organic top line growth, excellent margin expansion and solid EPS growth. We are confident that we can continue to manage through the present temporary headwinds and be well prepared for accelerated momentum when the pandemic effects ease. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And in other cases, we haven't been able to ship at all. We believe that based on some of the things that we're hearing on the ground that the market might open up in mid-May, but it's very -- it's uncertain right now. So we obviously had to put our assumptions together as it relates to the fourth quarter. And our assumptions assume that things will start to open up in mid-May. And then there will be a catch-up. So we do have the product in and around China for 6.18. It's a matter of getting it to our distribution center and then obviously, getting it out to customers in time."

That's obviously -- that negative 3% CAGR is with the addition of DECIEM. 
So I just want a little bit more perspective on how you're viewing the recovery in the Americas, what may have caused that fluctuation in multiyear growth first half versus what we saw in the third quarter and just how to think about the progression over the balance of the calendar year."

No, actually, we believe our North America business is actually accelerating and is in very good trend. Obviously, the sales by quarter may vary for a serious thing, including presence of holidays or presence of specific brands, innovations, et cetera. But in general, we had a plus 24% in the last 12 months and plus 10% in quarter 3. If you see in that quarter 3, Clinique is ranking #1 overall brand, M·A·C #1 in makeup. Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford, M·A·C, The Ordinary, they're all growing share. 
We are doing -- we are executing well the strategy of better covering all U.S. multi-ethnic consumer groups. We have improved our distribution mix, which now is more focused on high-growth, high-profit areas in general, particularly we have improved our online penetration during COVID, and we are maintaining it now. 
We have reestablished strong brick-and-mortar productivity, which was heavily hit by COVID, also closing 40 freestanding store and exiting a number of closing department stores doors. We are rolling out successfully the Ulta, Target, the Sephora called new doors, which are proving by the way to reach new consumers. We have a stronger M·A·C and Clinique performance business, which in North America are, frankly, the 2 key brands that are driving the overall size of the growth. 
We have some strong innovation successes in quarter 3. For example, MACStack, which we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is so far an extraordinary success. 
And I would underline, we are in a market where prestige has been recovery much faster pace than mass, which is exactly proving also that we are back into sourcing from mass new consumers, particularly with our entry prestige pricing brands like M·A·C, like Clinique, like The Ordinary. We also added with DECIEM acquisitions The Ordinary Brand, which is the fourth -- #4 in prestige U.S. brands already in skin care, which is an extraordinary position and ranking first in units in many of the retail partners where they're sold. 
And on top on speaking about distribution, 1/3 of our North America business now is in direct-to-consumer model with freestanding store brand.com and certain online activity, really, including social media direct activities, which give us a lot of more data, consumer data and understanding of the consumer that we ever had in the past. 
So it's been years of reshaping our North America business in a condition that we believe today is strong and is much more stronger platform for continued growth and continued market share development of most of our brands in the future as well.

I think M·A·C is really in a strong recovery trend and is, first of all, the makeup category in general, as I explained during the prepared remarks, is in what we call the renaissance, meaning they use educations of makeup coming back, basically back to office, back to restaurants, back to parties, back to vacations, all what we have seen gradually coming back with the COVID retreating at least up to a certain extent. This is working. 
And with the user education coming back, the entire category is flourishing again. Plus, as I mentioned, it's important that makeup is also linked to mood, meaning the joy of interpreting personalities, interpreting yourself. So a most positive sense of recovery from COVID has been developed in the last several months, and this has benefited the category. So M·A·C is the market leader in the prestige in quarter 3. And so obviously, it's benefiting of the overall category recovery. 
Second, the brand has now a better mix in distribution, has made important distribution choices. So it's reaching consumers better, is refocusing well on the multi-ethnic consumers have always been at the core of this brand and has extraordinary new creative power and ability to speak the M·A·C values to the consumers in new fresh ways. 
And innovation is back, meaning not only innovation in taste, style, looks that's been always the core of the brand, but also innovation in R&D, new ideas of performance like MACStack, which is, frankly, a technical product innovation as well. which builds on an idea, which is so close to the core M·A·C, which is makeup artistry, which is the ability to build mascara on your lashes in different stacks, and so allowing a different makeup artist interpretation or how much, how long and which locations, so the ultimate customization in mascara. That's a big deal. The consumer is answering fast and already is a leading mascara in North America and in any other market where it has been so far launched. So M·A·C is in a strong recovery trend, and we are very proud of the work of our team there."

Given the pandemic management in China right now, there is also a slowdown in traffic to Hainan. And so travel retail is being impacted as well in the fourth quarter, specifically Hainan along with China. 
As you saw in the third quarter when traffic slowed in our distribution and online, we pulled back on expenses, and we would be prepared to do the same in the fourth quarter if our assumptions change. The other thing that we are looking to do is have a temporary distribution center outside of the area that is most affected and hopefully, we'll mitigate some of the pressure on our Shanghai campus. 
So those are a couple of the things that we're planning to do as our plan B, if you will, if the market does not open up in the middle of May. But we are encouraged by some recent signs that we've seen in terms of -- or heard in terms of some of the cases coming down. But it's quite volatile, Dara, so this is the best estimate that we have at this time of the situation and what we could deliver in Q4."

We are in China for the long term and completely dedicated to continue to develop the market and serve our partners there. We are going to open soon our R&D center in China, which is a very big event and a very manifestation of long-term determination to continue to be locally relevant and serving the specific needs of this market. And obviously, we are going to do as soon as the COVID restrictions will allow us to proceed. 
So -- and the other thing I want to clarify that the China consumer demand underlining this moment of COVID restrictions is strong. And now it comes really from a multichannel online where it's more than 50% of the mainland sales. We grew double digit in quarter 3 despite what Tracey explained that in the last 15 days of March, we could not ship existing orders. That's the key point. We couldn't ship orders that we had already in our hands, both from retailers and consumers online. And so obviously, that's temporary and this happens to us in the past, in the United States, in Europe during the pandemic lockdowns. 
So we know how this works and how this happens, and we know also how to rebounds when this finishes because it's not about consumer demand. It's about access to consumers that has changed dramatically in a very short period of time. But the online was very, very strong, had a very strong February. And despite that, we grew market share in quarter 3 online, which is store despite the inability in the second half of March to serve consumers. 
Hainan was strong until mid-March, but then Hainan had a very strong decline of traffic. We estimate 60% to 70% in the second part of March. And in April, we saw 80% traffic reduction in Hainan. So that's what is reflected in our quarter 4. But also, we have seen historically that also the bounce back can be very strong because when these restrictions finish, people travel domestically very fast and very happily. And so the confidence into Hainan future is unchanged, actually increased given the incredible development of the place and the confidence in online is very strong also because together with the continuous success with Tmall, we are also now expanding and having good expansion online with JD, with in digital marketing with tic-talk activations. There are so many other things, which are in the making. 
Brick-and-mortar was the most impacted during the restrictions. And that's -- so as of mid-March was -- and the entire month of April was really impacted in the areas where there were restrictions. It was not everywhere, but was definitely in Shanghai, where we have a lot, as we discussed, the distribution center. 
So also want to clarify that the long-term fundamental of global prestige beauty in China and in travel retail China remains very, very good. Actually, I personally have never been more enthusiastic about the opportunity. When the market rebounds also should be much more profitable as we have seen in the U.S. because we -- because the market will rebound in travel retail, in online, in more productive brick-and-mortar and a more productive fragrance businesses than in any other region of the world because it's high-end fragrances is a much bigger percentage of the total development of the category. 
Also, we continue to invest in China, as Tracey has clarified. And obviously, we will tailor the investment to the level of access to consumers that the restriction will permit, but we will invest in the growth in the innovation center. There will be more brands in China coming to additional cities coverage as soon as the permissions the restrictions will allow. I spoke already about the strongest plans with our partner Tmall and further diversification of the coverage in the country. The category growth expansion beyond skin care, makeup, fragrances are coming up strongly. The supply chain that needs to be further diversified Tracey has alluded to, but we had already planned for fiscal year 2023 and '24 to have more regional distribution centers that we will deploy, but in the meantime, we'll look for certain temporary activity. 
Hainan expansion is also a story. There are new mega counters getting expanded in Hainan as we speak for -- not only for us, also for competition, but are extraordinarily new opportunities, which we are in the making temporary. Obviously, in this moment, as I said, there is little traffic. But in the -- for example, in July-September period, there will be more of discount expanded. 
the expectation for 6.18, assuming that the logistics can be resolved, is pretty strong. And also, I want to underline that we hear that it's very likely there will be more economic stimulus ahead in the country that will further develop consumptions in the next 12 to 18 months. So I just want to underline, I hope it was clear that we are really trying to be as prudent and objective as possible in reflecting the COVID restrictions. But we remain absolutely determined to continue to build our China and China TR businesses."

I'm assuming the mix was a negative given that you're selling less -- on a relative basis, you're growing less in skin care. Hope you share all of those."

My 400 basis points really was for the second half of the year. We started the year taking 3.5% of pricing increase. And typically, we take most of our pricing increases at the beginning of our fiscal year. We did take a second price increase in January. So the impact year-over-year for our second half is 4% pricing relative to prior year. And we expect to, in our upcoming -- the beginning of our upcoming fiscal year in July, take additional pricing. So -- and that pricing is strategic between levels within the tiers of our categories. 
So yes, skincare or higher-priced skincare might take higher price pricing, our lower-priced skin care would take lower price increases. It's very much dependent on the market, the currency, the inflation. There's a very sophisticated model that we use to determine what pricing for our various brands. So yes, we will have lower skin care sales in the fourth quarter. But on average, the pricing increases that we've taken will still be around 4%, and we do expect that they would cover the inflation that we are experiencing at the moment."

So a substantial amount of shipments. And then April also and the beginning of May also, we had limited capacity shipments. 
And also importantly, in the quarter 3 numbers that you see, the impact of the pandemic was mainly reflected in the Mainland China impact, while TR had a very strong quarter despite there was less traffic in the second part of March. So somehow ended up with higher stocks is in our assumptions. And then in the quarter 4 expectation, there is a bigger proportion of the impact of the reduced traffic in Hainan than there is, frankly, an impact in China. And so that's also maybe give you a bit more light on our assumptions in this very difficult situation, frankly, to interpret in a detailed level given the very high volatility."

You need to look at it like the brick-and-mortar in China, the online in China and Hainan. The combination of these 3 has been very, very strong, even if you look at our quarter 3 and you put together the results in together with the results in Mainland China online, as I said before, we were growing market share and growing double digit and the brick-and-mortar very soft moment. But when you put it all together, you see demand growth. 
When you look only Mainland China or only Hainan in certain moments without -- you may see different patterns by channel, but the total Chinese consumption has been very, very solid for us, for the industry, for competition in general. 
The other important thing to clarify that this is not changing also in the composition. For example, the most important segment in this moment in the China demand is high-end luxury brands. So both in our portfolio, brands like La Mer or Tom Ford or in our competitive portfolio or within our portfolio within a brand like Lauder, the performance of Renotriv, which is the high-end part of the brand. So everywhere, the high luxury part is doing better in growth than any other part. This doesn't suggest that the consumers are worried by the economy. This suggests the consumers are actually looking for high performance and strong experiences more and more in this moment. Said this, there is obviously a lower economic than expectation in this moment, but also, there is a lot of trust in the possibility of economic stimulus and in the possibilities of restarting stronger economic development. So I believe that the consumer sentiment is still overall solid."

No. I have to say that the -- we see the consumer sentiment, obviously, a different level of development by region. So first of all, the U.S., the consumer sentiment is solid. And in the U.S. is very interesting. You can also read the results by channel. And you see that prestige continues to grow and to accelerate in the post-COVID environment, at least from a consumer sentiment standpoint. The consumer -- sorry, prestige accelerate much faster than mass. They both are growing, but prestige is growing much more. 
And this is a sign. Again, this is a sign that consumers feel the confidence to go for quality, for performance, for experience and for what they feel connected to and the more and more. And to go back to the pleasure, to the joy to the self-pampering feelings, which are overall a positive consumer sentiment. 
But a positive doesn't mean necessarily trust in the long-term economy. Positive in what move beauty is a positive consumer sentiment also in the sense of the interest in dedicating to yourself, the interest in pampering yourself is actually the consumer center that is better explained by the coming out of very difficult periods rather than by necessarily only economic trends. And so that consumer sentiment is the one that pushed prestige beauty in general around the world. And this consumer sentiment is sometimes even stronger in movement of high stress. because there is more pampering needs. 
So strong in the U.S., I believe still solid in China, better in many other markets like Japan, like U.K., like the markets -- sorry, you can mention in a second, like Japan, like other markets in Asia, Korea, Singapore, which are all recovering from a tough COVID period. 
The only area where the consumer sentiment, as you know, is going down is Europe, and it's not because economical results because also in Europe there is pleasure of getting out of the pandemic pressure as a sentiment. But the war in Ukraine is obviously creating a very bad feeling around people. And so people are sad and there is this element the sentiment that create a mixed consumer sentiment at this moment in Europe. But that's the only area where the numbers suggest this. By the way, the number is not the business. The business in prestige beauty remains very, very solid, suggesting what I was explaining, which is the consumer sentiment, it is a mix of economic, external pressure like the world, but also how they feel in terms of how much they need to take care of themselves, to pamper themselves in this very difficult environment. So in that sense, prestige beauty is more resilient to these kind of situations than many other markets."

Actually, one of the key thing is happening is the skinification of many categories, including hair care. The skin care key trends are increasing. 
And what's happening in a very broad sense on top of anti-aging that remain very important, particularly with the growth of the more mature consumers growth in numbers and in interest in the category, what's happening is that skin care is entering category of instant benefits than in the past where basically only makeup area. Today, skin care is about anti-aging, is about also instant benefit. 
For instant benefit, I mean, I don't know, luminosity, even skin tone, brightness and there are so many different benefits that today are linked to how the skin looks in the day. You use it rather than just over time. And so the category is bigger, is that there are more usage occasions and there are more user reason, basically more benefits. And the industry is providing some amazing technology and some great progress in this area. 
On top of that, the penetration of skin care among different target groups and also younger target groups linked to the better penetration of instant benefits is increasing around the world. So frankly, we have a very positive view in skin care in the long term. Obviously, skin care is very strong in Asia and particularly in China. And so in a moment of restrictions like in China now, you will see less strong growth in skin care, but this, again, is temporary as we have explained of the entire situation. But the long-term skin care trend remains strong. 
In terms of the situation of Target calls -- Target and Kohl -- yes, Target, Ulta and Kohl's Sephora stores, we are pretty happy of the initial results there. These accounted for the moment only 3 points of growth in total, but for the quarter and of  North America. But the most important news is that it's bringing new consumers. So a lot of this is extra and give us the possibility to access new consumers, and our brands are doing very well in those spaces with these consumers. So this also is a good trend in the right direction, but it's only the beginning of the journey."

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we delivered organic sales growth of 9%, in line with our guidance despite the acceleration of temporary COVID-19 restriction in China in March. We exercised cost discipline as volatility increased, and our adjusted operating margin expanded, leading to stronger-than-expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 17%. 
Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to amplify the engines of the moment amid intensified macro environment, with sales rising organically across both brick-and-mortar and online. Every category grew organically, led by fragrances' outstanding performance. 11 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth and further demonstrated our diversified drivers. Consumer demand remains robust even in this inflationary environment. 
Our largest brands provided highly sought-after, M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique each delivered double-digit growth in makeup, fueling the category renaissance while La Mer thrived in skin care. Four of our scaling brands resonated strongly with consumers as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Aveda and Bobbi Brown each rose double digits. Among our developing brands, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Bumble and bumble each achieved outsized growth and showcased their promise. 
Our sales rose double digit organically in the Americas and EMEA. We capitalize on reopening to translate improving brick-and-mortar traffic trends into outstanding sales growth, owing to our high-touch services, breakthrough innovation, hero franchises and operational excellence. 
Our freestanding stores delivered exceptional performance benefiting from fleet optimization and expanded omnichannel capabilities and complement the strengths in specialty-multi. We are managing the ongoing complexities from the invasion of Ukraine as well as the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, which impacted performance in Asia Pacific in the quarter. 
In Mainland China, organic sales fell mid-single-digit as 25% growth online was offset by a steep decline in brick-and-mortar. After a strong February, in Mainland China, traffic slowed more sharply in March to pressure brick-and-mortar sales. Additionally, for us, the distribution centers for our Mainland China business are in Shanghai and operated with limited capacity. Tourism to Hainan Island was also curtailed in March after a vibrant start of the quarter. There is no doubt that these current limitations in China will prove to be transitory, although there will be a far greater impact on our results in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter, as Tracey will discuss. Looking ahead, we are confident in the resilience of the Chinese consumers and the untapped opportunity driving our investments in the market. We expect a reacceleration of growth when this moment of COVID abates. 
Let me share the progress we made during the third quarter to drive these strong results and advance our long-term ambitions for our multiple engine of growth strategy. Innovation excelled to reach nearly 30% of sales. We continue to elevate our ability to leverage data analytics with our best-in-class creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends. The breadth of our innovation wins was far-reaching and benefited every category. In skin care, La Mer upgraded The Treatment Lotion sort as the brand doubled down on this coveted East to West product, increasing the skin recharging Miracle Broth and transitioning to a recyclable luxurious glass bottle that contains 20% post-consumer recycled content. 
In Asia Pacific, consumer gravitated to the new serum strengths and anti-aging benefits, while in the Americas, educating on the benefits of hydration and energy proved impactful with consumers, demonstrating our expertise in serving multiple needs with one product and communicating with the appropriate local relevance. 
For makeup, M.A.C sought to grow its mascara base, especially across Gen Z, younger millennial and multi-ethnic consumers and created MACStack Mascara. With breakthrough technology that stacks and builds the last look. MACStack went viral on TikTok, having now amassed over 153 million views, and its sales far exceeded our expectations in the quarter. 
Tom Ford Beauty new private blend rose fragrances, feature locally relevant nodes, where Rose De Chine  feature Chinese golden peony and Rose D’Amalfi includes Italian bergamot. This launch drove exceptional results globally, including China, where the brand had a very successful Valentine's Day. 
Lastly, in hair care, Aveda launched botanical retail strengthening overnight serum, disrupting the category by creating our first overnight serum that builds new hair bonds while you sleep. The products sold key consumer pain points with quick-absorbing technology by leveraging a serum-based formula. Encouragingly, the product quickly rose to being the top-selling product in freestanding store and sold out on brand.com. 
We are excited to build upon this momentum with our new innovation center in Shanghai opens later this calendar year. This important investment in China will significantly increase our ability to serve the Chinese and Asian consumers with locally relevant and inspired innovation. Also, the new center will further enable our East to West innovation mindset, supporting the creation of more successes like La Mer's The Treatment Lotion. 
Looking at our growth engines by category, the strategic decision to pivot our fragrance portfolio to luxury and artisanal is benefit both top line growth and profitability. Fragrances performance in the third quarter was super with sales increasing 31% organically. Impressively, sales exceeded the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal year 2019 by nearly 50% on a reported basis. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, each delivered double-digit sales growth, and Estée Lauder brand complemented these strengths with its well-received new luxury collection. As consumers around the world increasingly express their individuality with scent, these brands are delivering outstanding results, with strong double-digit growth fiscal year-to-date in every region, driven by demand across channels from brick-and-mortar to online and travel retail. There freestanding doors are driving omnichannel experiences, while their online businesses have been transformed during the pandemic. 
And this fragrance brands are also contributing to our sustainability goals, with refillable packaging being a compelling element of the value proposition for Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS. We are also thrilled to announce that during the third quarter, Le Labo became B Corp certified, making it the first major fragrance brand and first within our company to receive this certification, indicating a high level of commitment to sustainability and impact. 
Turning to makeup. It was on this call a year ago that we introduced our expectation for makeup renaissance, anticipating it would gradually evolve market by market as social and professional use educations began to resume. We envisioned the category would experience a recovery driven by both restocking as well as a renaissance rooted in a renewed passion for the joy and creativity of makeup after a difficult time. 
Even with the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants, the makeup renaissance has delivered very favorable trends and offers great promise for the future. As usual location expanded in certain markets upon reopening in the third quarter, makeup once again delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the Americas and EMEA. M.A.C and Clinique's makeup sales growth accelerated sequentially, while Estée Lauder and La Mer businesses in the category are already ahead of pre-pandemic levels. 
While brands have been meticulous in executing their merchandising and innovation strategy for the renaissance, we invested to create the omni artist with meeting the consumers in innovative ways across brick-and-mortar and online to educate inspire new looks and offer the best in personalized high-touch services. 
M.A.C has been superb in this regard. So, too, has Bobbi Brown with events like live streams from the largest mall in Manchester, England to as per group classes to [ domain ] in China to one-to-one Zoom sessions in the U.S. 
Moving to hair care, Aveda, Bumble and bumble have reignited growth engines to contribute to the diversified category growth than we expected for fiscal year 2022. Impressively, even as these brands grew sales strong double digits in brick-and-mortar or reopening during the third quarter, they also achieved mid-single-digit online growth. 
Lastly, while skin care was pressured by COVID restrictions in the East, the bright spots were still many. In the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies across many long-term growth drivers  from luxury to prestige. La Mer performance was extraordinary, with sales rising strong double digits. As I discussed, it upgrades The Treatment Lotion sort creating a high effect on the still new hydrate infused emotion, while its heroes were highly sought after. With desirable innovation and coveted icons, La Mer is welcoming new consumers, earning their trust and traded them up as its ultra Genaissance de la Mer franchise is booming. While our high-end prestige skin care thrives with La Mer and Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv, Bobbi Brown is prospering in the heart of the category, thanks to its strategic focus on treasured heroes like vitamin-enriched face base. 
We are also laser focused on entry-level prestige to reach new consumers, notably with DECIEM The Ordinary as the brand amplifies its heroes to drive repeat with its ingredient-led regiment-based approach. After the quarter closed, DECIEM announced it will be refining its brand portfolio to focus resources on the compelling opportunity we foresee for The Ordinary and NIOD. 
During the quarter, we also improved upon the fundamentals of consumer acquisitions, engagement and high-touch services, positioning us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. Our partnership with TikTok expanded, and we are piloting new innovations on the platform to be at the forefront of social commerce innovations. In the U.S., several of our brands launched storefronts on TikTok, similarly linking to brand.com. Brands also expanded their capabilities with Instagram Shopping and launched category powered lenses on Snapchat similarly linked to brand.com. Clinique realized favorable engagement trends on TikTok and Instagram, and it featured its back in stock coveted Black Honey lipstick and strong recruitment growth with new advertising for Moisture Surgood evening 100 hour featuring the need for social phase of adventure campaign. 
The Estée Lauder brand entered the metaverse as connecting with our consumer wherever they are is paramount, and we are excited to be testing and learning in this new ecosystem. Estée Lauder was the exclusive beauty brand partner of Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week, the first ever large virtual fashion week in an unchanged metaverse. 
Around the world, our brands are increasingly leveraging new campaign management tools to tailor communication and drive repeat to both reengage with consumers and foster relationships with new consumers. We are realizing increased reactivation and repeat purchase rate from the U.K. to France, Australia and beyond. 
In closing, we delivered very strong performance amid the accelerating headwinds during the third quarter. We also made excellent progress advancing the long-term drivers of our multiple engine of growth strategy. These results in this progress are due to the tremendous accomplishments of our employees around the world to whom I extend my deepest thanks as they continue to manage complex situation with grace and ingenuity. 
Moreover, I'm incredibly inspired by our employees' compassion for each other. Last week marked the 2-year anniversary of the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund. The fund was created in response to employee increasing desire to support one another in times of need. Since inception, over $10 million has been distributed to employees globally from donations and company matches. 
Looking ahead, while we are lowering our expectation for the fourth quarter, given the impact of the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, we expect to deliver another record year in fiscal year 2022. We remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our business. This quarter proved the vibrancy of prestige beauty, its resiliency even in a difficult macro environment and the strength of our trusted brands and product innovations as markets sequentially recover from the prolonged pandemic. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

Our third quarter net sales grew 9% organically despite the increased complexity and volatility caused by the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was broad-based across categories and markets as most regions across the world continue to recover and grow, albeit at different rates. 
Sales in specialty-multi and freestanding retail stores led growth and online sales rose mid-single-digits. The inclusion of sales from the late May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 2 points to reported net sales growth, and currency was a headwind of approximately 1 point. 
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18%. Growth was realized across most markets, channels and brands. Market growth was led by both the recovery in the largest Western markets as well as in key emerging markets like Turkey and India. All brick-and-mortar channels grew, led by double-digit growth in department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi stores. Organic sales online declined when compared to the prior year quarter where online sales benefited both from the pandemic-driven store closures and reduced store traffic. All product categories and most brands grew in the region, led by La Mer, Jo Malone London and M.A.C. 
Our global travel retail business again grew double digits despite the challenges that arose during the quarter. Asia is the largest region for our travel retail business, and sales in the key markets of China and Korea were very robust at retail for most of the quarter. However, there was a precipitous decline in Chinese travel in March as restrictions to contain COVID were increased in China. We continue to see a sharp increase in travel retail sales outside of Asia as traffic increased throughout Europe and the Americas. 
Net sales in the Americas rose 11% organically, with all markets contributing to growth. All product categories grew with particular strength in makeup and hair care. The 2 largest prestige makeup brands in the U.S., M.A.C and Clinique, outpaced overall category growth to gain share. Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford Beauty also gained share helping to further drive the makeup renaissance as more consumers continued their return to the workplace and resumed more social occasions. 
Our sales in specialty-multi and in freestanding retail stores strongly outperformed this quarter as consumers return to stores for shopping and services. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth, and favorable currency movement contributed 1 point to sales growth in the region. 
In our Asia Pacific region, organic net sales fell 4%, driven entirely by Greater China. For the quarter, net sales in Mainland China declined mid-single-digits. Following a strong Lunar New Year in February, sales declined in March as additional COVID restrictions impacted many cities, most notably Shanghai, where our distribution centers serving the entire country are located. The restriction sharply curtailed productivity at these facilities, affecting our ability to both receive product being shipped into the country and to fulfill demand across all channels of distribution. However, shipments should begin to normalize as restrictions ease. 
Net sales in Hong Kong also declined throughout the quarter as the city took increasing measures to contain the virus. Partially offsetting these decreases with strong net sales growth in most other markets, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Online sales in Asia Pacific grew strong double digits as we continue to expand our brand reach across new platforms. 
Our gross margin improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic price increases of approximately 4% combined with favorable currency and reduced obsolescence contributed to the increase in gross margin as well as the favorable impact of anniversary last year's under absorption of manufacturing overhead. This more than offset the impact of increased inflationary pressures in our supply chain, mainly in logistics and materials and increasing start-up costs for our new plant in Japan. 
Operating expenses decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of general and administrative expense was partially offset by increased shipping costs related to higher freight rates and more air shipments on increased sales volume. Additionally, as cities throughout China began tightening restrictions and traffic to Hainan slowed, we reduced certain expenses to correspond with slower retail traffic. 
Operating income rose 15% to $917 million, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.6% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.90 increased 17% compared to the prior year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $216 million of impairment to goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to Dr. Jart+, reflecting forecast for slower-than-expected growth in China and travel retail. We continue to believe in the growth potential of the brand, which has been impacted by the temporary COVID disruptions in Asia given its strong growth prior to the start of the pandemic as well as the growth seen in recovering markets. 
For the 9 months, we generated $1.97 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2.78 billion last year, which reflects investments in working capital to both support growth and mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruptions as well as higher cash paid for taxes. This was partially offset by higher net income. We significantly increased our capital investment to $658 million to support the ongoing construction of our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. Investments in our innovation center in Shanghai as well as investments in online and technology enhancements. And we returned $2.62 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
Turning now to our outlook. As you have heard and are aware, there have been 2 significant headwinds that have emerged since we last gave guidance in early February, increased COVID-related restrictions in China also impacting Hainan and the invasion of Ukraine. Our current guidance for the balance of this year reflects continued momentum in the Americas and EMEA excluding travel retail as well as the continuation of lockdowns and corresponding distribution constraints in China through at least the first half of our fourth quarter. While we expect continued growth at retail in both Mainland China and Hainan, the severity of the distribution constraints we are experiencing are expected to result in a meaningful decline in net sales for these areas for the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to fulfill the majority of our orders in time for our planned 6.18 activities. The elimination of sales in Russia and Ukraine has reduced expected fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 120 basis points. 
At the same time, we delivered outstanding results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, with greater diversification of our growth drivers. Our geographic diversity is a tremendous asset, and we expect our multiple engines of growth to continue, including the ongoing recovery of the Americas, Western Europe and most markets in Asia. We expect to also deliver strong margin improvement for the year. The benefit of our strategic pricing actions this year, along with agility and our cost management are helping to offset the initial effects of increasing inflation throughout this fiscal year. We plan to continue to invest in the recovery, support innovation and assuming current disruptions abate, fuel upcoming key shopping moments in the quarter, like 6.18 in China and Mother's Day. 
With these assumptions as our backdrop for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are now forecasted to grow 5% to 7%. This range excludes approximately 2 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.05 and $7.15 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. These expectations imply margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points, including dilution of 40 basis points from DECIEM this year. 
In closing, we managed extremely well through an increasingly complex environment in our third quarter, and these complexities are expected to meaningfully impact our fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to expect to deliver a very strong year with above-average organic top line growth, excellent margin expansion and solid EPS growth. We are confident that we can continue to manage through the present temporary headwinds and be well prepared for accelerated momentum when the pandemic effects ease. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And in other cases, we haven't been able to ship at all. We believe that based on some of the things that we're hearing on the ground that the market might open up in mid-May, but it's very -- it's uncertain right now. So we obviously had to put our assumptions together as it relates to the fourth quarter. And our assumptions assume that things will start to open up in mid-May. And then there will be a catch-up.

That's obviously -- that negative 3% CAGR is with the addition of DECIEM. 
So I just want a little bit more perspective on how you're viewing the recovery in the Americas, what may have caused that fluctuation in multiyear growth first half versus what we saw in the third quarter and just how to think about the progression over the balance of the calendar year."

No, actually, we believe our North America business is actually accelerating and is in very good trend. Obviously, the sales by quarter may vary for a series of things, including presence of holidays or presence of specific brands, innovations, et cetera. But in general, we had a plus 24% in the last 12 months and plus 10% in quarter 3. If you see in that quarter 3, Clinique is ranking #1 overall brand, M.A.C #1 in makeup. Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford, M.A.C, The Ordinary, they're all growing share. 
We are doing -- we are executing well the strategy of better covering all U.S. multi-ethnic consumer groups. We have improved our distribution mix, which now is more focused on high-growth, high-profit areas in general, particularly we have improved our online penetration during COVID, and we are maintaining it now. 
We have reestablished strong brick-and-mortar productivity, which was heavily hit by COVID, also closing 40 freestanding store and exiting a number of closing department stores doors. We are rolling out successfully the Ulta, Target, the Sephora called new doors, which are proving by the way to reach new consumers. We have a stronger M.A.C and Clinique performance business, which in North America are, frankly, the 2 key brands that are driving the overall size of the growth. 
We have some strong innovation successes in quarter 3. For example, MACStack, which we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is so far an extraordinary success. 
And I would underline, we are in a market where prestige has been recovery much faster pace than mass, which is exactly proving also that we are back into sourcing from mass new consumers, particularly with our entry prestige pricing brands like M.A.C, like Clinique, like The Ordinary. We also added with DECIEM acquisitions The Ordinary brand, which is the fourth -- #4 in prestige U.S. brands already in skin care, which is an extraordinary position and ranking first in units in many of the retail partners where they're sold. 
And on top on speaking about distribution, 1/3 of our North America business now is in direct-to-consumer model with freestanding store brand.com and certain online activity, really, including social media direct activities, which give us a lot of more data, consumer data and understanding of the consumer that we ever had in the past. 
So it's been years of reshaping our North America business in a condition that we believe today is strong and is much more stronger platform for continued growth and continued market share development of most of our brands in the future as well. So we are very positive of our North America trend and also very proud of today having a strong and motivated team, which is in action and which is driving the business forward."

This is working. 
And with the user education coming back, the entire category is flourishing again. Plus, as I mentioned, it's important that makeup is also linked to mood, meaning the joy of interpreting personalities, interpreting yourself. So a most positive sense of recovery from COVID has been developed in the last several months, and this has benefited the category. So  M.A.C is the market leader in the prestige in quarter 3. And so obviously, it's benefiting of the overall category recovery. 
Second, the brand has now a better mix in distribution, has made important distribution choices. So it's reaching consumers better, is refocusing well on the multi-ethnic consumers have always been at the core of this brand and has extraordinary new creative power and ability to speak the M.A.C values to the consumers in new fresh ways. 
And innovation is back, meaning not only innovation in taste, style, looks that's been always the core of the brand, but also innovation in R&D, new ideas of performance like MACStack, which is, frankly, a technical product innovation as well. which builds on an idea, which is so close to the core of M.A.C, which is makeup artistry, which is the ability to build mascara on your lashes in different stacks, and so allowing a different makeup artist interpretation or how much, how long and which locations, so the ultimate customization in mascara. That's a big deal. The consumer is answering fast and already is a leading mascara in North America and in any other market where it has been so far launched. So M.A.C is in a strong recovery trend, and we are very proud of the work of our team there."

Given the pandemic management in China right now, there is also a slowdown in traffic to Hainan. And so travel retail is being impacted as well in the fourth quarter, specifically Hainan along with China. 
As you saw in the third quarter when traffic slowed in our distribution and online, we pulled back on expenses, and we would be prepared to do the same in the fourth quarter if our assumptions change. The other thing that we are looking to do is have a temporary distribution center outside of the area that is most affected and hopefully, we'll mitigate some of the pressure on our Shanghai campus. 
So those are a couple of the things that we're planning to do as our plan B, if you will, if the market does not open up in the middle of May. But we are encouraged by some recent signs that we've seen in terms of -- or heard in terms of some of the cases coming down. But it's quite volatile, Dara, so this is the best estimate that we have at this time of the situation and what we could deliver in Q4."

And on your question on -- you asked about retailer relationships. We are in China for the long term and completely dedicated to continue to develop the market and serve our partners there.

We are in China for the long term and completely dedicated to continue to develop the market and serve our partners there. We are going to open soon our R&D center in China, which is a very big event and a very manifestation of long-term determination to continue to be locally relevant and serving the specific needs of this market. And obviously, we are going to do as soon as the COVID restrictions will allow us to proceed. 
So -- and the other thing I want to clarify that the China consumer demand underlining this moment of COVID restrictions is strong. And now it comes really from a multichannel online where it's more than 50% of the Mainland sales. We grew double digit in quarter 3 despite what Tracey explained that in the last 15 days of March, we could not ship existing orders. That's the key point. We couldn't ship orders that we had already in our hands, both from retailers and consumers online. And so obviously, that's temporary and this happened to us in the past, in the United States, in Europe during the pandemic lockdowns. 
So we know how this works and how this happens, and we know also how to rebound when this finishes because it's not about consumer demand. It's about access to consumers that has changed dramatically in a very short period of time. But the online was very, very strong, we had a very strong February. And despite that, we grew market share in quarter 3 online, which is store despite the inability in the second half of March to serve consumers. 
Hainan was strong until mid-March, but then Hainan had a very strong decline of traffic. We estimate 60% to 70% in the second part of March. And in April, we saw 80% traffic reduction in Hainan. So that's what is reflected in our quarter 4. But also, we have seen historically that also the bounce back can be very strong because when these restrictions finish, people travel domestically very fast and very happily. And so the confidence into Hainan future is unchanged, actually increased given the incredible development of the place and the confidence in online is very strong also because together with the continuous success with Tmall, we are also now expanding and having good expansion online with JD, [Indiscernible] with in digital marketing with TikTok activations. There are so many other things, which are in the making. 
Brick-and-mortar was the most impacted during the restrictions. And that's -- so as of mid-March was -- and the entire month of April was really impacted in the areas where there were restrictions. It was not everywhere, but was definitely in Shanghai, where we have a lot, as we discussed, the distribution center. 
So also I want to clarify that the long-term fundamental of global prestige beauty in China and in travel retail China remains very, very good. Actually, I personally have never been more enthusiastic about the opportunity. When the market rebounds also should be much more profitable as we have seen in the U.S. because we -- because the market will rebound in travel retail, in online, in more productive brick-and-mortar and a more productive fragrance businesses than in any other region of the world because it's high-end fragrances is a much bigger percentage of the total development of the category. 
Also, we continue to invest in China, as Tracey has clarified. And obviously, we will tailor the investment to the level of access to consumers that the restriction will permit, but we will invest in the growth in the innovation center. There will be more brands in China coming soon, additional cities coverage as soon as the permissions the restrictions will allow. I spoke already about the strongest plans with our partner Tmall and further diversification of the coverage in the country. The category growth expansion beyond skin care, makeup, fragrances are coming up strongly. The supply chain that needs to be further diversified Tracey has alluded to, but we had already planned for fiscal year 2023 and '24 to have more regional distribution centers that we will deploy, but in the meantime, we'll look for certain temporary activity. 
Hainan expansion is also a story. There are new mega counters getting expanded in Hainan as we speak for -- not only for us, also for competition, but are extraordinarily new opportunities, which we are in the making temporary. Obviously, in this moment, as I said, there is little traffic. But in the -- for example, in July-September period, there will be more of discount expanded. 
The expectation for 6.18, assuming that the logistics can be resolved, is pretty strong. And also, I want to underline that we hear that it's very likely there will be more economic stimulus ahead in the country that will further develop consumptions in the next 12 to 18 months. So I just want to underline, I hope it was clear that we are really trying to be as prudent and objective as possible in reflecting the COVID restrictions. But we remain absolutely determined to continue to build our China and China TR businesses."

And also just a clarification on Tracey's comments on the pricing front with, I think, a 400 basis point impact of pricing in the quarter. So I was hoping to hear what is the rollover impact on the carryover into the fourth quarter and the mix impact. I'm assuming the mix was a negative given that you're selling less -- on a relative basis, you're growing less in skin care. Hope you share all of those."

My 400 basis points really was for the second half of the year. We started the year taking 3.5% of pricing increase. And typically, we take most of our pricing increases at the beginning of our fiscal year. We did take a second price increase in January. So the impact year-over-year for our second half is 4% pricing relative to prior year. And we expect to, in our upcoming -- the beginning of our upcoming fiscal year in July, take additional pricing. So -- and that pricing is strategic between levels within the tiers of our categories. 
So yes, skincare or higher-priced skincare might take higher price pricing, our lower-priced skin care would take lower price increases. It's very much dependent on the market, the currency, the inflation. There's a very sophisticated model that we use to determine what pricing for our various brands. So yes, we will have lower skin care sales in the fourth quarter. But on average, the pricing increases that we've taken will still be around 4%, and we do expect that they would cover the inflation that we are experiencing at the moment."

So a substantial amount of shipments. And then April also and the beginning of May also, we had limited capacity shipments. 
And also importantly, in the quarter 3 numbers that you see, the impact of the pandemic was mainly reflected in the Mainland China impact, while TR had a very strong quarter despite there was less traffic in the second part of March. So somehow ended up with higher stocks is in our assumptions. And then in the quarter 4 expectation, there is a bigger proportion of the impact of the reduced traffic in Hainan than there is, frankly, any impact in China. And so that's also maybe give you a bit more light on our assumptions in this very difficult situation, frankly, to interpret in a detailed level given the very high volatility."

You need to look at it like the brick-and-mortar in China, the online in China and Hainan. The combination of these 3 has been very, very strong, even if you look at our quarter 3 and you put together the results in TR together with the results in Mainland China online, as I said before, we were growing market share and growing double digit and the brick-and-mortar very soft moment. But when you put it all together, you see demand growth. 
When you look only Mainland China or only Hainan in certain moments without -- you may see different patterns by channel, but the total Chinese consumption has been very, very solid for us, for the industry, for competition in general. 
The other important thing to clarify that this is not changing also in the composition. For example, the most important segment in this moment in the China demand is high-end luxury brands. So both in our portfolio, brands like La Mer or Tom Ford or in our competitive portfolio or within our portfolio within a brand like Lauder, the performance of Re-Nutriv, which is the high-end part of the brand. So everywhere, the high luxury part is doing better in growth than any other part. This doesn't suggest that the consumers are worried by the economy. This suggests the consumers are actually looking for high performance and strong experiences more and more in this moment. Said this, there is obviously a lower economy than expectation in this moment, but also, there is a lot of trust in the possibility of economic stimulus and in the possibilities of restarting stronger economic development. So I believe that the consumer sentiment is still overall solid."

No. I have to say that the -- we see the consumer sentiment, obviously, a different level of development by region. So first of all, the U.S., the consumer sentiment is solid. And in the U.S. is very interesting. You can also read the results by channel. And you see that prestige continues to grow and to accelerate in the post-COVID environment, at least from a consumer sentiment standpoint. The consumer -- sorry, prestige accelerate much faster than mass. They both are growing, but prestige is growing much more. 
And this is a sign. Again, this is a sign that consumers feel the confidence to go for quality, for performance, for experience and for what they feel connected to and the more and more. And to go back to the pleasure, to the joy to the self-pampering feelings, which are overall a positive consumer sentiment. 
But a positive doesn't mean necessarily trust in the long-term economy. Positive in what move beauty is a positive consumer sentiment also in the sense of the interest in dedicating to yourself, the interest in pampering yourself is actually the consumer center that is better explained by the coming out of very difficult periods rather than by necessarily only economic trends. And so that consumer sentiment is the one that pushed prestige beauty in general around the world. And this consumer sentiment is sometimes even stronger in movement of high stress, because there is more pampering needs. 
So strong in the U.S., I believe still solid in China, better in many other markets like Japan, like U.K., like the markets -- sorry, you can mention in a second, like Japan, like other markets in Asia, Korea, Singapore, which are all recovering from a tough COVID period. 
The only area where the consumer sentiment, as you know, is going down is Europe, and it's not because economical results because also in Europe there is pleasure of getting out of the pandemic pressure as a sentiment. But the war in Ukraine is obviously creating a very bad feeling around people. And so people are sad and there is this element -- the sentiment that create a mixed consumer sentiment at this moment in Europe. But that's the only area where the numbers suggest this. By the way, the number is not the business. The business in prestige beauty remains very, very solid, suggesting what I was explaining, which is the consumer sentiment, it is a mix of economic, external pressure like the horrible war, but also how they feel in terms of how much they need to take care of themselves, to pamper themselves in this very difficult environment. So in that sense, prestige beauty is more resilient to these kind of situations than many other markets."

Actually, one of the key thing is happening is the skinification of many categories, including hair care. The skin care key trends are increasing. 
And what's happening in a very broad sense on top of anti-aging that remain very important, particularly with the growth of the more mature consumers growth in numbers and in interest in the category, what's happening is that skin care is entering category of instant benefits than in the past where basically only makeup area. Today, skin care is about anti-aging, is about also instant benefit. 
For instant benefit, I mean, I don't know, luminosity, even skin tone, brightness and there are so many different benefits that today are linked to how the skin looks in the day. You use it rather than just over time. And so the category is bigger, is that there are more usage occasions and there are more user reason, basically more benefits. And the industry is providing some amazing technology and some great progress in this area. 
On top of that, the penetration of skin care among different target groups and also younger target groups linked to the better penetration of instant benefits is increasing around the world. So frankly, we have a very positive view in skin care in the long term. Obviously, skin care is very strong in Asia and particularly in China. And so in a moment of restrictions like in China now, you will see less strong growth in skin care, but this, again, is temporary as we have explained of the entire situation. But the long-term skin care trend remains strong. 
In terms of the situation of Target Kohl's -- Target and Kohl -- yes, Target, Ulta and Kohl's Sephora stores, we are pretty happy of the initial results there. These accounted for the moment only 3 points of growth in total, but for the quarter and of  North America. But the most important news is that it's bringing new consumers. So a lot of this is extra and give us the possibility to access new consumers, and our brands are doing very well in those spaces with these consumers. So this also is a good trend in the right direction, but it's only the beginning of the journey."

Reported sales rose 9% despite heightened foreign exchange pressure to end the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to an all-time high of 19.7%. We realized this greater profitability even as our growth engines diversified beyond our highest margin categories. 
Fragrance, makeup and hair care delivered double-digit sales growth on a reported basis to complement our robust skin care business. Impressively, 9 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth for the year despite the significant pressure from COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter. 
La Mer, Jo Malone London and Le Labo showcased the strength of our portfolio across our large, scaling and developing brands, respectively. M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique powered makeup emerging renaissance, with double-digit gains in the category as Jon Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty elevated fragrance to new heights with striking growth. 
Our geographic diversity has been a distinct benefit during the pandemic, allowing us to create and capture growth where opportunities presented themselves around the world. Asia Pacific led growth in fiscal '20 and '21 as markets in the West were more negatively impacted by COVID-19, while the Americas and EMEA drove growth in 2022 as the East confronted renewed pressure from the virus. 
Today, our $17.7 billion in annual reported revenues tops prepandemic levels by 19% fueled by organic sales growth and enhanced by our acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points over the 3 years. 
Our trusted brands with the hero products and sought-after innovation are tried, while our increasingly flexible cost structure has served us well. 
Our focus on hero product has been a winning strategy. This high repeat loyalty-inducing products have grown significantly as a mix of our business since fiscal year 2019. Throughout, we have continued to innovate to propel our hero strategy for the years ahead. Innovation served as a powerful catalyst for growth this year, representing over 25% of sales once again. 
Our newness exceeded consumer desires due to our exceptional data analytics, R&D and creative capabilities. La Mer's Hydrating Infusion Emulsion, Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv Diamond Serum and MACStack mascara are among our breakthrough launches this year, driving favorable earned media value and strong new consumer acquisition. 
Turning to category performance. Fragrance grew a stunning 32% organically for the year. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle each rose strong double digit and expanded in every region, including excellent results in travel retail in EMEA. Estée Lauder brand launched the luxury collection, and [indiscernible] contributed double-digit gains. The outstanding performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this accretive segment of the category. 
Consumers' behaviors due the pandemic reinforced fragrance as part of self-care and solidified online as the destination for the category to explore, learn and purchase. Our brands stepped up to create and leverage these new dynamics. We capitalize on the recovery in brick-and-mortar in many markets, realizing high levels of engagement in freestanding stores, while online continue to prosper for the category. 
Makeup [indiscernible] a powerful growth engine in fiscal year 2022. Strong double-digit organic sales gains in the Americas and EMEA more than offset a double-digit decline in Asia Pacific. As markets in the West reopened, leading to more social and professional use educations, the makeup renaissance emerge. Our brand excelled with innovative artists as well as new products, which focused on performance, ingredient narratives and skinifications of makeup. We leveraged increased traffic in brick-and-mortar, which allowed us to reestablish our well-loved services in store [indiscernible] growth in services. 
Hair care proved to be a valuable growth engine, contributing double-digit organic sales growth. The unique value proposition and go-to-market strategy for each of Aveda and Bumble and bumble resonated with consumers who increasingly expect the benefits of quality products and performance-based ingredients. 
The skin care category was the most [ started ] from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the second half of the fiscal year as restriction reduced traffic in brick-and-mortar as well as travel retail and also temporarily curtailed our distribution capacity in Mainland China. In this context, we delivered solid results as excellent performance from La Mer, Clinique, Bobbi Brown offset pressure from other brands. 
La Mer had a remarkable year. Consumers around the world gravitated to its icon and robust innovations, embracing newness like the Hydrating Infused Emulsion and the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion to expand their regiments. Genaissance de la Mer lifted sales further as consumers traded up to the brand Ulta luxury franchise for its artisanal quality and parallel efficacy and high-curated experiences. 
Clinique and Bobbi Brown success in skin care demonstrated the execution of our sophisticated hero strategy to drive strong repeat and consumer loyalty. Clinique heroes across categories from makeup remover to serum to moisturizer provided it with a winning former, while Bobbi Brown's global and regional hero philosophy is driving its mix of business in skin care much higher. 
Looking now at channels. Both brick-and-mortar and online served as growth engines for the year as we pushed exciting initiatives to amplify our omnichannel capability. Let me share a few of the highlights. Brick-and-mortar rebounded strongly in the America and EMEA, specialty multi, freestanding stores and department store all contributed. Our Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program enabled us to improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building, experiential brick-and-mortar footprint as intended. 
Online grew mid-single digits organically led by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific. This in high online penetration boosted reported sales growth in the channel to double digits. Our online channel encompassing brand.com, third-party platforms, pure-play retailers and retail.com is now far more than twice as big prepandemic fiscal '19. 
China and the U.S., which already [ higher ] online penetration, have expanded further, while markets in EMEA have seen a surge in online penetration that are now able to realize the benefits of scale. 
During the year, we diversified in high-growth channels globally to expand our consumer reach. Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins initially launched on JD in China. And given the insight gain as well as new consumer acquisition trends, we introduced more brands on JD. Jo Malone and La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia, and many brands participated in the emerging Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora calls partnership in the U.S., both in store and online. 
We continue to innovate across the online ecosystem to generate trial and repeat. In America, which has historically been a strong market for direct selling, we leverage WhatsApp and drove social selling to represent 30% of online sales in the region. Around the world, our beauty advisers and makeup artists became content creators for always-on creation across social media platforms like TikTok. This showcases the powerful evolution of the reach and scale of our expert advice, which now stands well beyond brick-and-mortar. 
We also advanced our omnichannel strategy meaningfully this year. In North America, most of our freestanding stores are now equipped with fulfillment capability. We also plan to stand up these features in EMEA and Asia Pacific. These new capabilities are driving higher average order values and convincing upsell trends. 
At the same time, we extended the reach of our loyalty programs globally, introducing programs in Japan, Italy and Mexico, and expanding offering in other markets across EMEA and Asia Pacific. Here, too, the results are compelling. We are realizing greater purchase frequency, higher level of retention from consumer engaged in loyalty programs. 
During the fiscal year, we also progressed our ESG goals and commitments. We continue to make strides on our climate action strategy, including the expansion of our renewable energy portfolio across our direct operations globally, and we're recognized by a leading for our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity. 
In packaging, we set a more ambitious goal to increase the post-consumer recycled content of our packaging to 25% or more by the end of 2025 and set a new goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum packaging to 50% or less by the end of 2030. 
We expanded employee resource groups, a great source of community and unity. Our network of Black leaders and executives launched in Brazil while we [indiscernible] a group of LGBTQIA+ employees launched in EMEA. We created a group for our ageless employees and continue to scale our reverse mentoring program globally, pairing more junior talent with senior leaders to share insights and perspectives on trends to drive better business decisions and foster career development. 
We brought our unique signature women leadership program, open doors to our international markets with continued great success in promoting our next generation of women leaders. We realized important progress with the -- from average a leadership development program. Its inaugural class has already achieved high level of career mobility in the forms of promotions and new roles for Black employees. We are encouraged by these initial results and look forward to continued success from this sponsorship program, which we created for equitable advancement and professional development of our Black talent. 
Before I talk about the year ahead, let me conclude on fiscal year 2022 by speaking about DECIEM, which complemented our organic sales growth. The Ordinary DECIEM's ingredient-based brand diversified in exciting ways over the last few months. The brand launched in India and Malaysia, expanded its hair care offering and also introduced [indiscernible] lash, a brow serum, to extend its authorities in treatment. From its innovation exceeding expectation to outstanding initial results in [indiscernible] in India, The Ordinary enter fiscal year 2023 with promising opportunities. 
Now for the future. We refreshed our 10-year Compass to help steer our ambitions and investment for the next decade. The Compass reinforced our confidence showcasing the abundant growth opportunities ahead. The drivers are many led by growing middle class globally, and most especially in emerging markets, expanding usage across consumer segments, including ageless and men and online expansion, fostering consumer access and reach. From the Compass, we distilled our 3-year strategy. As we look across the next 3 years, we expect to deliver more balanced growth across categories and regions. Near term, the pandemic and macro factors will likely lead to more valuable growth by category and regions. 
We are very confident in the strength of our company and in the vibrancy of prestige beauty. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth fueled by our diversified growth engines and enticing innovation and to take the opportunity in a volatile year to continue investing for our exciting future to build global share. While the external challenges are many, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and currency headwinds, the enduring desirability of our brands with the hero products and high repeat rates is powerful. Additionally, our more effective cost structure, pricing power and strong cash generation should afford us the flexibility to successfully navigate the ongoing complex environment. 
Innovation is poised to be a catalyst for growth, and we began the year with exciting news. Let me share insights about 2 skin care launches. Estée Lauder upgraded Advanced Night Repair eye supercharge gel cream, addresses the signs of eye agings and reflects consumer modern lifestyles of long screen times and environmental stressors. Offering notable incremental benefits from the original product, this launch demonstrates the pricing power of innovation. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line extended its fiscal 2022 innovation [indiscernible] with the launch of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. The moisturizer is coupled with the powerful new claims for Smart Clinical Repair Serum to drive gains in this hero franchise. 
This year, we expect to reignite growth engines in Asia Pacific as the pressure of COVID-19 abates. We anticipate in-store traffic levels to gradually improve in Mainland China, allowing brick-and-mortar to return to growth to complement ongoing strength online and for tourism trends to Hainan to ultimately accelerate from the most recent post, which began last week. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, evidenced by our expansion into almost 100 new doors and 3 additional cities in fiscal year 2022 as well as our introduction of Aveda last month. We are thrilled to enter the hair care category with Aveda, which is vegan and [indiscernible] approved as the brand launched on Tmall and opened its first freestanding store in the market. 
Fiscal 2023 is set to be a monumental year for us as of our Shanghai innovation lab opens, advancing our ambition to best create for the Chinese consumers, and we begin limited production in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is our first ever in Asia Pacific. With these 2 strategic initiatives, we expect to benefit over the next few years from increased speed-to-market and by further expanding our momentum with outstanding locally relevant innovation in this vibrant region. 
For the Americas and EMEA, we anticipate ongoing strength from our growth engines across categories and channels as well as across developed and emerging markets given the broad-based gains of fiscal year 2022. 
For makeup, which is a vital category in both regions, the emergence of [indiscernible] Renaissance give us great confidence going into fiscal year 2023. In North America, and particularly, our focus turns to granular consumer growth opportunity as we have refined our distribution. 
To close, we delivered excellent performance in fiscal year 2022, achieving record results while advancing initiatives for consumer acquisition, engagement and high-touch services and experiences to drive trial and repeat levels even higher. Today, our business is not only far bigger and more profitable than the prepandemic fiscal year 2019, but our growth drivers are more diversified. Our R&D and innovation capabilities are more robust, and our cost structure is more flexible. 
While the year ahead more certainly has its external challenges, our company is poised for a bright future as the best diversified pure player in prestige beauty with the most talented and passionate employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023. Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, re",2503,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023. 
Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan, as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region. 
Reported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points. 
From a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. Consumers continued their return to brick-and-mortar, leading to strong growth in freestanding retail and specialty multi-stores. We grew sales in nearly every market in the region, with particular strength in Canada and across Latin America. 
Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 9% organically driven almost entirely by the disruptions in travel retail in China and the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine. Of the remaining markets in the region, 10 rose double digit as tourists returned to the region, and consumer traffic and brick-and-mortar retail thrived. 
The makeup, fragrance and hair care categories rose strong double digits in EMEA, while the decline in skin care reflected the soft travel retail sales in Asia. 
Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, declined in Asia due to the COVID restrictions in China. Hainan, in particular, was impacted as stores were closed a portion of the quarter, travel was curtailed to the island and courier services for online deliveries were disrupted. However, travel retail in European markets and in the Americas rose triple digits as airport traffic returned and doors in the channel reopened. 
Net sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 19% organically. Greater China and Korea net sales were the most impacted by the COVID restriction. Hardest hit was Shanghai, where the city-wide lockdown lasted 2 months, impacting our distribution capacity serving all of China through the end of May. 
Overall, our brands performed well for the important 6/18 holiday festival and maintain top rankings across the beauty space on both Tmall and JD. 
Elsewhere in Asia, there were some other bright spots. Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam continued to recover and have begun to reopen to tourism. 
Looking now at net sales by product category. Fragrance led organic growth, with net sales rising 22% versus prior year. The fragrance category grew double digits across all regions. 
Luxury fragrances continue to resonate with consumers looking for indulgence. And our brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and La Labo were once again star performers. 
Net sales in makeup rose 8% organically driven by the continued recovery and increased usage occasions in Western markets where makeup is generally the largest category. M·A·C and Clinique were top brand performers driven by hero products like M·A·C Studio Fix and the newly launched MACStack mascara as well as Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Continued success and expansion in specialty multi-doors is also aiding category growth. 
Hair care net sales grew 5% organically. Excellent performance from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi contributed to growth. The launch of Aveda's vegan hair color in EMEA and a successful activation around the brand's hero and body franchise in Korea also aided category growth. 
Net sales in skin care were the most impacted by the COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting Greater China, Asian travel retail and Korea. Skin care continues to represent approximately 2/3 of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales fell 21% in the quarter due to the disruption of the Shanghai distribution center, with the greatest impact felt by Estée Lauder and La Mer brands. Skin care growth benefited from the addition of DECIEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Our gross margin declined 370 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by factors affecting our supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and higher costs for both ocean and air transport have increasingly pressured our cost of goods. Unfavorable category mix from softer skin care sales also contributed to the decline. 
Operating expenses decreased 9% driven by the curtailment of spending this quarter as COVID restrictions sharply reduced store traffic in China, including Hainan. We delivered operating income of $207 million for the quarter compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 included $0.03 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. 
Shifting now to our full year results. Given the volatility experienced throughout the year, the results reflect the benefit derived from the diversification of our top line growth as well as the incredible agility of our teams and their ability to effectively manage costs while also simultaneously investing selectively for future growth. 
Net sales rose 8% organically, with double-digit gains in 3 out of 4 product categories and 2 out of 3 regions. Sales of our products online continued to thrive even as brick-and-mortar recovered, rising 11% for the year and representing 28% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, most channels grew double digit, while department stores ended the year down slightly as pressure from COVID restrictions in Asia offset growth in other regions. And our business in travel retail also grew, ending fiscal 2022 at 27% of sales. 
Our gross margin fell 60 basis points to 75.8%. Favorable pricing and currency were more than offset by higher supply chain costs, which were more pronounced in the back half of the year, the impact of the acquisition of DECIEM and higher costs for new products and sets. 
Operating expenses declined 150 basis points to 56% of sales. Disciplined expense management and general and administrative costs was the largest contributor to the decline. The changes in our channel mix continue to reduce selling costs. And additionally, we continue to drive more effective resource allocation in our advertising and promotional mix. These favorable trends were partially offset by increased shipping costs. 
During the year, we continue to create more flexibility in our cost structure to absorb inflation in wages, media and logistics. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including the post-COVID business acceleration program. This has enabled us to realize greater expense leverage while also reinvesting in areas that support profitable growth, resulting in an overall improvement in our operating margin. 
Our full year operating margin was 19.7%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over last year. This improvement includes the absorption of 60 basis points of dilution from DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.3%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by a lower current year tax benefit associated with share-based compensation and the prior year favorable impact of the U.S. government issuance of final GILTI tax regulations that provided for a retroactive high-tax exception. 
Net earnings rose 11% to $2.6 billion, and diluted EPS increased 12% to $7.24. Earnings per share includes $0.04 accretion from currency translation and $0.05 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. 
The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is wrapping up, with final estimated restructuring charges of $500 million to $515 million at the top end of our original projections. We are pleased with the progress we achieved from this program. We realigned our brand portfolio by exiting 4 designer fragrance brands as well as the BECCA and [indiscernible] brands, and we are streamlining our market distribution for Smashbox and GLAMGLOW to improve their long-term viability. 
We optimized our brick-and-mortar distribution network. We have been and will continue to close underproductive freestanding retail stores as we rebalance our distribution network. By the end of fiscal 2023, we expect to have closed nearly 250 freestanding retail stores under the program. We've also rationalized department store counters and other retail locations, improving our ability to focus our efforts on driving more profitable omnichannel opportunities in our remaining distribution. 
We also approved initiatives to optimize our organization across regions and throughout global functions to reduce complexity, leverage our scale and enhance our go-to-market capabilities. When we are finished executing the program, we expect a net reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 positions globally. We expect to execute the remaining projects to achieve estimated annualized gross savings of between $390 million and $410 million before taxes beginning in fiscal 2024. A portion of these savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in capabilities that sustain our long-term growth, including data analytics, online and advertising. 
Turning now to our cash flow. We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior year period. The primary driver was higher working capital due to the end of year disruptions related to the pandemic the past few years as well as inventory to support future growth and to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have faced in certain raw material and componentry areas. We utilized $1 billion for capital improvements, an increase of approximately $400 million over last year. We continue to invest in capacity and other supply chain improvements. We increased consumer-facing investments to support in-store experiences and recovery markets. We renovated office space, and we continue to invest in information technology. 
We also returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace this year as the need for more stringent cash conservation subsided with the progression of the recovery. During the year, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.3 billion, and we paid $840 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase in our dividend rate that became effective in our fiscal second quarter. 
All in all, we delivered a strong year despite significant disruptions, including continued outbreaks of COVID, higher inflation, supply chain constraints and the invasion in Ukraine. And we also continue to invest in foundational capabilities for the future, including new production capacity and innovation to support growth. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we believe that the prestige beauty category has ample opportunities for continued strong growth. Global prestige beauty is expected to grow mid- to high single digits driven by the continued recovery and the gradual reopening of the remaining markets impacted by COVID restrictions. Additionally, we look forward to the continued resumption of international travel, especially in Hainan and the rest of Asia. 
We are concerned, however, that the recovery this fiscal year will once again not be a smooth one. Record inflation and the threat of recession or slowdown in many markets could temporarily dampen consumer enthusiasm and is causing some retailers to be more cautious regarding inventories. 
The strengthening dollar is putting pressure on our international earnings. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions could prove to be disruptive. With that backdrop in mind, for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 9%. We discontinued 4 designer fragrance licenses at the end of fiscal 2022. These brands generated $250 million in sales in fiscal 2022. In fiscal '23, we will sell some remaining inventory to the new licensees, primarily in the first half. Sales from both years will be excluded from our organic growth figures. 
At current levels, currency is projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in fiscal '23 as the U.S. dollar strengthens against key currencies. Based on July 31 spot rates at 1.018 for the euro, 1.215 for the pound, 6.746 for the Chinese yuan and 13 03 for the Korean won, we expect currency translation to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 3 percentage points as well as an additional 1 point due to the impacts of foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets. 
There are a few other items impacting our sales growth in fiscal 2023. Our list price increases are expected to add approximately 5.5 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary cost pressures. We take most of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. New distribution, including new doors in existing markets, new markets for certain brands and expansion on new online platforms, could add another 2 points. Conversely, the loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine are expected to trim about 1 percentage point from sales growth. We plan to continue to drive margin expansion through operational efficiencies and cost savings while fueling additional advertising investment where appropriate. 
Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.39 and $7.54 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 5% to 7%. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is also expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 6 percentage points. 
At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to fall 4% to 6%. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point, and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 3 points. 
Our first quarter sales are expected to be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan. As you may recall, last year, we mentioned that some of our retailers in North America secured holiday shipments earlier due to supply chain concern, contributing 1.5 points to our growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This year, retailers in the U.S. have been tightening their inventories, causing our net sales to trail retail sale. We expect China and travel retail in APAC to gradually improve throughout the first half of the fiscal year as COVID restrictions lift. And comparisons should ease in the back half of the year as we lap the invasion of Ukraine and the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China. 
We expect first quarter EPS of $1.22 to $1.32. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 5 percentage points. 
In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our strategy to outpace industry growth. Our multiple engines of growth delivered in fiscal 2022, and we anticipate this more diversified growth can continue in the coming year. And importantly, we continue to reinforce the fundamental drivers of our business that both enable and contribute to continued strong future sales and EPS growth. 
I would like to close by extending our heartfelt gratitude to our employees around the globe for continuing to deliver our results during this challenging macro environment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Can you just give us a bit more of a sense on what you've factored in to both Q1 and the full year guidance on COVID lockdowns? Are you assuming the city restrictions that are in place today continue throughout Q1? And then what do you assume post Q1 in the balance of the year in terms of lingering shutdowns? 
And then second, it's very hard for us to judge externally your underlying market share performance in China ex supply issues. I'm sure it's difficult for you also. But just any perspective on underlying market share trends as supply returns to normal, perhaps so far in fiscal Q1, that'd be helpful. And if you expect any of the supply issues recently to have an impact on your forward share at all."
207221,717175452,2634447,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","So I'll start, Dara, regarding China and what we've baked into our assumptions.

Our distribution center is open. We're actually -- and opened in June, as we mentioned. So we were well prepared for the 6/18 holiday festival, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. We are still seeing some intermittent shutdowns, not whole city shutdowns in China at the moment. So that is still disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. So we have factored that in certainly to our Q1 expectations for the China market. 
As it relates to Hainan, as we mentioned also in our prepared remarks, and I'm sure you all have seen, Hainan is experiencing a lockdown right now. So all of the doors are closed. Courier services as well have been suspended for online orders. And we're obviously monitoring that day by day, but that is something that began in the month -- at the beginning of the month of August. And right now, we're expecting that to continue through the end of the month of August with some resumption in September, but not full resumption in September, recognizing that as this situation continues to impact the market, there will be some level of reticence for consumers to travel. But we certainly expect that, that will improve in the upcoming months. 
So I think first quarter and first half, we are expecting some level of muted performance in the region related to these issues. We do expect second quarter to be better than first quarter. And then in the second half, obviously, we're anniversarying quite a bit of disruption in the fourth quarter, some of which, again, in the third quarter for both Hainan as well as China. And we do expect that we will see strong growth in the second half. 
For the full year, we do expect China to grow double digit. And so again, we are -- it is a market that we know there is very strong demand for prestige beauty and for our products and the same with Hainan as well. So we are just navigating through these first few months of the year until we get on the other side in the second half."
207221,717175452,2634447,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","And I'll comment on market share.

As Tracey just said, we do expect for the full year, China to go back growing double digit. We expect strong recovery in Hainan in the second part, in the second semester of the fiscal year, for sure, a gradual recovery before. That's our assumption, which obviously is going to give us also results in market share. 
So speaking about the last -- the quarter 4, to be clear, the market in China was down 10%. Estée Lauder Company was down 13%. So we lost 1 point of market share. We are now at 23%, so very strong market share. 
I would like to argue that given the lockdown of our distribution center, the impossibility of serving for almost 2 months, our consumers losing 1 point of market share temporarily is actually showing that already in June, we started recovery with an outstanding 6/18 event and the management of this. 
And then to speak about what we are going to do further in the next 6 months to recover the market share we lost because of the distribution down, first of all, strong brand portfolio brands. We are going to reinforce it with the launch of Aveda that just started, which is a very important launch entering the hair care, big and growing category, the luxury hair care, big and growing category in China. We are going to double down on Tmall and entering new successful online distribution that we started with JD, where we still have opportunity of deploying more brands in other areas where we are testing or distributing. 
We have very strong innovation starting with what we discussed in the remarks, which is the Estée Lauder Advanced Repair eye product, which eye is one of the most important categories in China, and to be clear, it's one of the most important recruitment strategies is eye products in the market. As you know, we are opening an R&D center this year. And so we are investing at even stronger innovations in the future. 
We are getting a great strategy to win in key shopping moments. I think that we had demonstrated the [indiscernible] in June for the 18/6 event is extraordinary. Our team, we are coming out of 40 days down in Shanghai, and they were able to operate successfully a very complex and important event. We are going to do the same with 11/11, hopefully, now in the second quarter. 
We are also improving our distribution in brick-and-mortar. We are opening new cities and new doors in the existing fast-growing cities. We have a new distribution center that we have opened. Actually, we opened this Friday in Guangzhou to mitigate risk of future distribution disruptions, and then this will turn into a definite ongoing new second big distribution center in the beginning of 2023. 
We believe the Hainan, despite the current lockdown, which is obviously painful in the short term, but is a superstrong opportunities for the long term. The power of Hainan in the future remain intact, and we have strong presence and market share in this operation. 
And I want to say we have an amazing local team, and this local team, they've been able to manage through these difficulties extremely well, and we believe that strength on which we can count in the future to continue building market share over time. Thank you for the question."

We did call out, obviously, in our prepared remarks and in the press release a couple of adjustments in our revenue numbers this year. So we did exit our prestige designer licensed businesses. Basically, we ended those licenses. Our focus is on luxury fragrance and artisanal fragrance. And so we did let those licenses expire. That is about 1 point of growth. The other point is related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and Ukraine. And so that is also contributing another point, if you will, to adjusted growth and to the suppression of growth that you're referring to. And then lastly, the currency impact on revenue also impacts us in terms of our growth algorithm. 
So if you adjust for all of those items, it's about 6 points of difference between what we've guided for the full year and where we expect -- where we would expect to end if none of those events had happened. So that is the reason why the growth looks a bit muted even with the 5.5% pricing. 
The other thing I would say again is we are starting the year with a fair amount of disruption as we just spoke about in some of our very important markets. And we are assuming a more gradual recovery, and that, too, impacts our unit growth."

The proof I can give you is that the top of the ranges are growing the fastest also on our brand. La Mer is one of our fastest-growing brands as an example. So the -- and importantly, the market is very active when there are no restrictions, when there is no issues.

So -- and as we think about the first quarter and the guidance that we've provided, we do expect gross margins to be down as well in the first quarter, not to the same extent as they were in the fourth quarter, and that will gradually improve throughout the year as we're anniversarying some of those disruptions. 
So for the full year, we're expecting gross margins to be around flat at the moment. But the first -- it's a tale of 2 halves in terms of the first half and some of the things we're anniversarying and some of the pressures that we're seeing on the business. But we do expect for the full year gross margin to be flat. 
In terms of SG&A, again, we expect that we will continue to get good SG&A leverage. I think we're incredibly proud of what our team was able to deliver this past fiscal year and fiscal 2022 in terms of the expense leverage that we were able to deliver.

And so fundamentally -- and I know it's important to understand what's going on in gross margin, but really, what we focus on is operating margin. 
And as we have seen channel shifts and market shifts, et cetera, those have impacted the gross margin, perhaps in some cases -- in some of those cases, more negatively, but they have impacted the operating margin quite positively. So at the end of the day, we're focused on delivering operating margin and profitable growth. 
In terms of whether or not we expect that we will get back to higher levels of gross margin, it is something that we are working on with our supply chain. So between our direct procurement programs, between some of the things we're doing in transportation, the opening of our Japanese plant, which should allow us to be not only closer to the consumer, but even to some of our suppliers for inbound freight should also help us from a gross margin standpoint. I'm not going to commit that we're going to get back to the gross margins that we were at 5 or 6 years ago, but do know that there are things that we see that are opportunities that we're also working on and very close partnership with our supply chain."

In terms of makeup, we continue to be quite bullish on the makeup category. We did see a recovery, particularly in our Western markets. So part of the strength that we saw this year -- this past fiscal year in terms of the growth in makeup and the improvement in margin that we saw in makeup was related to recovery, in particular, in brick-and-mortar in our Western markets, so in the Americas as well as in Europe. We are still challenged a bit in makeup in our Eastern markets because of some of the disruption that's going on, in particular, in brick-and-mortar. And -- but we expect makeup to gradually improve as the disruption in those markets improve, and similar to Western markets, as consumers resume their normal social and professional occasions. So that is our expectation in terms of when we'll get back to fiscal '19 levels for makeup, depending on the disruptions this year. It may take another year or so. But our makeup brands have fantastic innovation for this year, in particular, the M·A·C brand, but others as well. And so we're very encouraged in terms of makeup. 
As it relates to the margin, the makeup category has been particularly hit by the pandemic that is now going on for 3 years because of the brick-and-mortar distribution of makeup, and in particular, with a few of our makeup brands where services in store are very well loved by our consumers and the in-store experience, that took -- that was a bit of a challenge with doors closed and with traffic down. And traffic is still down in brick-and-mortar. Even in the markets that are in recovery, traffic has not recovered to prior levels, but it's well on its way to do so. 
So I think one of the reasons why we took some of the actions we did with the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is take a point of view to your point of what that will look like when things are stabilized and what the mix between brick-and-mortar and online should be and took proactive measures to close some underproductive doors, and largely, that will help the makeup category. Most -- many of those stores were makeup doors. Some of them were Origins stores. Some of them were Bobbi doors, actually. So that should continue to help to make up category as volume returns to -- in particular, brick-and-mortar."

So we will see further progress over time, particularly in the East where the COVID lockdowns are still creating issues, not only in distribution, but also in consumer in consumer usage of makeup. 
The other important thing is that makeup is really a [indiscernible] is linked to services. And so to have the proper experience, you need critical mass per store. And the critical mass per store is dependent on traffic, as Tracey said. So this is also getting better. The renaissance is if you want at the beginning. So more progress is in front of us. And that progress in particularly would also impact positively the bottom line and the profitability of the category. So we are in the right direction, and we have not yet done on this."

This is a very good number, and we believe it's an efficient number. Now it can be 25% or 30%, depending by quarter. But that's, anyway, very powerful innovation. The thing that we have improved also the rhythm of innovation. We have innovation really gradually per category, per quarter, per brand in a very sophistic way, market by market to make sure that we can leverage it. And the innovation is strongly supported by sufficient media. And our advertising in total is increasing in fiscal year [ 2020 ] in absolute level. And that's a list in the current assumptions guidance. And these advertising -- some part of it is guiding the innovation and the innovation results. But also, a lot of our innovation is attracting earned media value in a fantastic way. A good example of this has been MACStack in the last fiscal year. So it's not only paid media, but it's also earned media that is attached to high-quality innovation. And so some of the high-quality innovation is also efficient from a spending standpoint, for a media standpoint for that reason. 
And then finally, innovation is driving pricing because innovation many times is about improving product, improving product performance or entering benefit areas that are more important for the consumer that's willing to pay more. And so we can invest in our standing products that deliver these results and price for these results as well. So it's a combination of factor why innovation is and will continue to be a very strong driver. And if you assume more or less the same percentage of innovation on a growing business, so innovation in absolute -- will also increase year after year in absolute level. 
On distribution, we have opportunities still to increase distribution. And we are doing it particularly online where there are a lot of new online ways to access consumer in efficient and productive way. It's also important to understand that the distribution opportunity at the end is about consumer coverage. It's about covering consumers that have desire today that are not covered. The best example of this is, for example, in emerging markets, starting from China, as an example, where we are covering 148 cities, but demand come from 600 cities or more, and we serve the cities where there is no physical distribution value online. This is happening the same in India. It's happening in Brazil. It's happening in Mexico. It's happening in many of the emerging markets. So the new distribution online is covering new consumer in the large majority of cases, and it's very efficient. 
There is a lot of opportunity. There is some, which are already in this fiscal year, the fiscal year 2023 assumption. And there are many in the medium and long term that we are studying and prepared to do."

So that's very much taken into consideration. 
We also, depending on -- because we have a very broad price tier, obviously, of our products from Lamar and Frederic Malle and Tom Ford to Clinique and M·A·C and The Ordinary, we also look at for our entry-level prestige brands the gap to their comparable closest mass brand. And so we are also cognizant of that. That has served us quite well in those multi-specialty accounts that you're referring to where our goal continues to be trading consumers up from mass to prestige. And that has worked quite well for us in those particular accounts.

So in other words, doesn't -- we try to avoid duplication in distribution as much as possible and maximize consumer coverage.

So that's one way that we expand distribution, particularly in a market where consumers had not had that opportunity to purchase that product before unless they traveled. 
We also expand with our existing retailers. So here in North America, as Ulta and Sephora opened new doors or any other retailer opens new doors, it is our consideration without being over retailed from a brick-and-mortar standpoint of expanding in those stores as well. And that's an expanded -- expansion in terms of distribution. So if our retailer opens 20 new doors this year, we will open those doors with them. And so we include that in our distribution. I think I said in my prepared remarks that we expect around 2 points of growth this year from distribution. And largely, it's those types of distribution. 
Fabrizio talked as well about pure plays. Pure plays have been a fantastic way for us to actually -- selective pure plays. We're very selective to actually reach new consumers, in particular, younger consumers and -- who are shopping more online and maybe shopping on an apparel site online that we have an opportunity to introduce beauty products to and get a new consumer as well as a new shopping occasion as they're shopping for their apparel products. So it's a very thoughtful way that we think about distribution and expanding distribution right now really to focus on reaching new consumers."

We really saw the currency depreciation beginning in the currencies that I mentioned that are the most impactful to us in the second half of our year, really starting in the March, April time frame.

I'm grateful to be with you today to reflect on our record results for fiscal year 2022 and discuss the drivers of our outlook for fiscal year 2023.
We leveraged our strengths amid the prolonged pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine and the onset of higher inflation. Our multiple NGO growth strategy, flexible financial model and exceptional talent enabled us to deliver record performance. At the same time, we invested for long-term growth, reflecting our confidence in the vibrancy of prestige beauty now and in the future.
We achieved better-than-expected results in our fourth quarter, leading to above guidance organic sales growth of 8% for fiscal year 2022. Reported sales rose 9% despite heightened foreign exchange pressure to end the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to an all-time high of 19.7%. We realized this greater profitability even as our growth engines diversified beyond our highest margin categories.
Fragrance, makeup and hair care delivered double-digit sales growth on a reported basis to complement our robust skin care business. Impressively, 9 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth for the year despite the significant pressure from COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter. La Mer, Jo Malone London and Le Labo showcased the strength of our portfolio across our large, scaling and developing brands, respectively. M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique powered makeup emerging renaissance, with double-digit gains in the category as Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty elevated fragrance to new heights with striking growth.
Our geographic diversity has been a distinct benefit during the pandemic, allowing us to create and capture growth where opportunities presented themselves around the world. Asia Pacific led growth in fiscal '20 and '21 as markets in the West were more negatively impacted by COVID-19, while the Americas and EMEA drove growth in 2022 as the East confronted renewed pressure from the virus.
Today, our $17.7 billion in annual reported revenues tops prepandemic levels by 19% fueled by organic sales growth and enhanced by our acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points over the 3 years. Our trusted brands with the hero products and sought-after innovation have thrived, while our increasingly flexible cost structure has served us well.
Our focus on hero product had been a winning strategy. This high repeat loyalty-inducing products have grown significantly as a mix of our business since fiscal year 2019. Throughout, we have continued to innovate to propel our hero strategy for the years ahead. Innovation served as a powerful catalyst for growth this year, representing over 25% of sales once again.
Our [ newness ] exceeded consumer desires due to our exceptional data analytics, R&D and creative capabilities. La Mer's Hydrating Infused Emulsion, Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv diamond serum and MACStack mascara are among our breakthrough launches this year, driving favorable earned media value and strong new consumer acquisition.
Turning to category performance. Fragrance grew a stunning 32% organically for the year. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle each rose strong double digits and expanded in every region, including excellent results in travel retail in EMEA. Estée Lauder brand launched the luxury collection, and AERIN contributed double-digit gains. The outstanding performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this accretive segment of the category.
Consumers' behaviors during the [ market ] pandemic reinforced fragrance as part of self-care and solidified online as the destination for the category to explore, learn and purchase. Our brands stepped up to create and leverage these new dynamics. We capitalized on the recovery in brick-and-mortar in many markets, realizing high levels of engagement in freestanding stores, while online continue to prosper for the category.
Makeup remitted a powerful growth engine in fiscal year 2022. Strong double-digit organic sales gains in the Americas and EMEA more than offset a double-digit decline in Asia Pacific. As markets in the West reopened, leading to more social and professional use educations, the makeup renaissance emerge.
Our brand excelled, with innovative artists as well as new products, which focused on performance, ingredient narratives and skinifications of makeup. We leveraged increased traffic in brick-and-mortar, which allowed us to reestablish our well-loved services in store to realize terrific growth in services.
Hair care proved to be a valuable growth engine, contributing double-digit organic sales growth. The unique value proposition and go-to-market strategy for each of Aveda and Bumble and bumble resonated with consumers who increasingly expect the benefits of quality products and performance-based ingredients.
The skin care category was the most impacted from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the second half of the fiscal year as the restriction reduced traffic in brick-and-mortar as well as travel retail and also temporarily curtailed our distribution capacity in Mainland China. In this context, we delivered solid results as excellent performance from La Mer, Clinique, Bobbi Brown offset pressure from other brands.
La Mer had a remarkable year. Consumers around the world gravitated to its [ iconic and robust ] innovations, embracing newness like The Hydrating Infused Emulsion and the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion to expand their regimens. Genaissance de la Mer lifted sales further as consumers traded up to the brand ultra-luxury franchise for its artisanal quality, unparalleled efficacy and high-curated experiences.
Clinique and Bobbi Brown's success in skin care demonstrated the execution of our sophisticated hero strategy to drive strong repeat and consumer loyalty. Clinique heroes across categories from makeup remover to serum to moisturizer provided it with a winning formula, while Bobbi Brown's global and regional hero philosophy is driving its mix of business in skin care much higher.
Looking now at channels. Both brick-and-mortar and online served as growth engines for the year as we pushed exciting initiatives to amplify our omnichannel capability. Let me share a few of the highlights. Brick-and-mortar rebounded strongly in the America and EMEA as specialty multi, freestanding stores and department store all contributed. Our Post-COVID Business Acceleration program enabled us to improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building, experiential brick-and-mortar footprint as intended.
Online grew mid-single digits organically led by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific. This in high online penetration boosted reported sales growth in the channel to double digits. Our online channel encompassing brand.com, third-party platforms, pure-play retailers and retail.com is now far more than twice as big prepandemic fiscal '19. China and the U.S., which already high online penetration, have expanded further, while markets in EMEA have seen a surge in online penetration that are now able to realize the benefits of scale.
During the year, we diversified in high-growth channels globally to expand our consumer reach. Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins initially launched on JD in China, and given the insight gain as well as new consumer acquisition trends, we introduced more brands on JD. Jo Malone London and La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia, and many brands participated in the emerging Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora and Kohl's partnership in the U.S., both in store and online.
We continue to innovate across the online ecosystem to generate trial and repeat. In Latin America, which has historically been a strong market for direct selling, we leverage WhatsApp and drove social selling to represent 30% of online sales in the region. Around the world, our beauty advisers and makeup artists became content creators for always-on creation across social media platforms like TikTok. This showcases the powerful evolution of the reach and scale of our expert advice, which now stands well beyond brick-and-mortar.
We also advanced our omnichannel strategy meaningfully this year. In North America, most of our freestanding stores are now equipped with fulfillment capability. We also began to stand up these features in EMEA and Asia Pacific. These new capabilities are driving higher average order values and convincing upsell trends.
At the same time, we extended the reach of our loyalty programs globally, introducing programs in Japan, Italy and Mexico, and expanding offering in other markets across EMEA and Asia Pacific. Here, too, the results are compelling. We are realizing greater purchase frequency, higher level of retention from consumer engaged in loyalty programs.
During the fiscal year, we also progressed our ESG goals and commitments. We continue to make strides on our climate action strategy, including the expansion of our renewable energy portfolio across our direct operations globally, and we're recognized by a leading NGO for our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity. In packaging, we set a more ambitious goal to increase the post-consumer recycled content of our packaging to 25% or more by the end of 2025 and set a new goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum packaging to 50% or less by the end of 2030.
We expanded employee resource groups, a great source of community and unity. Our network of Black leaders and executives launched in Brazil while wELCome, our group of LGBTQIA+ employees, launched in EMEA. We created a group for our ageless employees and continue to scale our reverse mentoring program globally, pairing more junior talent with senior leaders to share insights and perspectives on trends to drive better business decisions and foster career development.
We brought our unique signature women leadership program, Open Doors, to our international markets, with continued great success in promoting our next generation of women leaders. We realized important progress with the From Every Chair leadership development program. Its inaugural class has already achieved high level of career mobility in the forms of promotions and new roles for Black employees. We are encouraged by these initial results and look forward to continued success from this sponsorship program, which we created for equitable advancement and professional development of our Black talent.
Before I talk about the year ahead, let me conclude on fiscal year 2022 by speaking about DECIEM, which complemented our organic sales growth. The Ordinary, DECIEM's ingredient-based brand, diversified in exciting ways over the last few months. The brand launched in India and Malaysia, expanded its hair care offering, and also introduced Multi-Peptide Lash and Brow Serum to extend its authorities in treatment. From each innovation exceeding expectation to outstanding initial results in Nykaa in India, The Ordinary enters fiscal year 2023 with promising opportunities.
Now for the future. We refreshed our 10-year compass to help steer our ambitions and investment for the next decade. The compass reinforced our confidence showcasing the abundant growth opportunities ahead. The drivers are many, led by growing middle class globally and most especially in emerging markets; expanding usage across consumer segments, including ageless and men; and online expansion, fostering consumer access and reach.
From the compass, we distilled our 3-year strategy. As we look across the next 3 years, we expect to deliver more balanced growth across categories and regions. Near term, the pandemic and macro factors will likely lead to more valuable growth by category and regions.
We are very confident in the strength of our company and in the vibrancy of prestige beauty. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth fueled by our diversified growth engines and enticing innovation, and to take the opportunity in a volatile year to continue investing for our exciting future to build global share.
While the external challenges are many, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and currency headwinds, the enduring desirability of our brands with the hero products and high repeat rates is powerful. Additionally, our more effective cost structure, pricing power and strong cash generation should afford us the flexibility to successfully navigate the ongoing complex environment.
Innovation is poised to be a catalyst for growth, and we began the year with exciting news. Let me share insights about 2 skin care launches. Estée Lauder upgraded Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme addresses the signs of eye agings and reflects consumer modern lifestyles of long screen times and environmental stressors. Offering notable incremental benefits from the original product, this launch demonstrates the pricing power of innovation.
Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line extended its fiscal 2022 innovation [ strength ] with the launch of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. The moisturizer is coupled with the powerful new claims for Smart Clinical Repair Serum to drive gains in this hero franchise.
This year, we expect to reignite growth engines in Asia Pacific as the pressure of COVID-19 abates. We anticipate in-store traffic levels to gradually improve in Mainland China, allowing brick-and-mortar to return to growth to complement ongoing strength online and for tourism trends to Hainan to ultimately accelerate from the most recent post, which began last week.
We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, evidenced by our expansion into almost 100 new doors and 3 additional cities in fiscal year 2022 as well as our introduction of Aveda last month. We are thrilled to enter the hair care category with Aveda, which is vegan and Leaping Bunny-approved, as the brand launched on Tmall and opened its first freestanding store in the market.
Fiscal 2023 is set to be a monumental year for us as of our Shanghai innovation lab opens, advancing our ambition to best create for the Chinese consumers, and we begin limited production in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is our first ever in Asia Pacific. With these 2 strategic initiatives, we expect to benefit over the next few years from increased speed-to-market and by further expanding our momentum with outstanding locally relevant innovation in this vibrant region.
For the Americas and EMEA, we anticipate ongoing strength from our growth engines across categories and channels as well as across developed and emerging markets given the broad-based gains of fiscal year 2022. For makeup, which is a vital category in both regions, the emergence of the makeup renaissance give us great confidence going into fiscal year 2023. In North America in particular, our focus turns to granular consumer growth opportunity as we have refined our distribution.
To close, we delivered excellent performance in fiscal year 2022, achieving record results while advancing initiatives for consumer acquisition, engagement and high-touch services and experiences to drive trial and repeat levels even higher. Today, our business is not only far bigger and more profitable than the prepandemic fiscal year 2019, but our growth drivers are more diversified, our R&D and innovation capabilities are more robust, and our cost structure is more flexible.
While the year ahead most certainly has its external challenges, our company is poised for a bright future as the best diversified pure player in prestige beauty with the most talented and passionate employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude.
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023.Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, ref",2502,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023.
Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan, as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region.
Reported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
From a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically, led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. Consumers continued their return to brick-and-mortar, leading to strong growth in freestanding retail and specialty multi-stores. We grew sales in nearly every market in the region, with particular strength in Canada and across Latin America.
Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 9% organically driven almost entirely by the disruptions in travel retail in China and the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine. Of the remaining markets in the region, 10 rose double digit as tourists returned to the region, and consumer traffic and brick-and-mortar retail thrived. The makeup, fragrance and hair care categories rose strong double digits in EMEA, while the decline in skin care reflected the soft travel retail sales in Asia.
Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, declined in Asia due to the COVID restrictions in China. Hainan, in particular, was impacted as stores were closed a portion of the quarter, travel was curtailed to the island and courier services for online deliveries were disrupted. However, travel retail in European markets and in the Americas rose triple digits as airport traffic returned and doors in the channel reopened.
Net sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 19% organically. Greater China and Korea net sales were the most impacted by the COVID restriction. Hardest hit was Shanghai, where the city-wide lockdown lasted 2 months, impacting our distribution capacity serving all of China through the end of May. Overall, our brands performed well for the important 6.18 holiday festival and maintained top rankings across the beauty space on both Tmall and JD. Elsewhere in Asia, there were some other bright spots. Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam continued to recover and have begun to reopen to tourism.
Looking now at net sales by product category. Fragrance led organic growth, with net sales rising 22% versus prior year. The fragrance category grew double digits across all regions. Luxury fragrances continue to resonate with consumers looking for indulgence, and our brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo were once again star performers.
Net sales in makeup rose 8% organically driven by the continued recovery and increased usage occasions in Western markets where makeup is generally the largest category. M·A·C and Clinique were top brand performers driven by hero products like M·A·C Studio Fix and the newly launched MACStack mascara as well as Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Continued success and expansion in specialty multi-doors is also aiding category growth.
Hair care net sales grew 5% organically. Excellent performance from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi contributed to growth. The launch of Aveda's vegan hair color in EMEA and a successful activation around the brand's hero and body franchise in Korea also aided category growth.
Net sales in skin care were the most impacted by the COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting Greater China, Asian travel retail and Korea. Skin care continues to represent approximately 2/3 of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales fell 21% in the quarter due to the disruption of the Shanghai distribution center, with the greatest impact felt by Estée Lauder and La Mer brands. Skin care growth benefited from the addition of DECIEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points.
Our gross margin declined 370 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by factors affecting our supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and higher costs for both ocean and air transport have increasingly pressured our cost of goods. Unfavorable category mix from softer skin care sales also contributed to the decline.
Operating expenses decreased 9%, driven by the curtailment of spending this quarter as COVID restrictions sharply reduced store traffic in China, including Hainan. We delivered operating income of $207 million for the quarter compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 included $0.03 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM.
Shifting now to our full year results. Given the volatility experienced throughout the year, the results reflect the benefit derived from the diversification of our top line growth as well as the incredible agility of our teams and their ability to effectively manage costs while also simultaneously investing selectively for future growth.
Net sales rose 8% organically, with double-digit gains in 3 out of 4 product categories and 2 out of 3 regions. Sales of our products online continued to thrive even as brick-and-mortar recovered, rising 11% for the year and representing 28% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, most channels grew double digit, while department stores ended the year down slightly as pressure from COVID restrictions in Asia offset growth in other regions. And our business in travel retail also grew, ending fiscal 2022 at 27% of sales.
Our gross margin fell 60 basis points to 75.8%. Favorable pricing and currency were more than offset by higher supply chain costs, which were more pronounced in the back half of the year; the impact of the acquisition of DECIEM; and higher costs for new products and sets. Operating expenses declined 150 basis points to 56% of sales.
Disciplined expense management and general and administrative costs was the largest contributor to the decline. The changes in our channel mix continue to reduce selling costs, and additionally, we continue to drive more effective resource allocation in our advertising and promotional mix. These favorable trends were partially offset by increased shipping costs.
During the year, we continue to create more flexibility in our cost structure to absorb inflation in wages, media and logistics. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including the Post-COVID Business Acceleration program. This has enabled us to realize greater expense leverage while also reinvesting in areas that support profitable growth, resulting in an overall improvement in our operating margin.
Our full year operating margin was 19.7%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over last year. This improvement includes the absorption of 60 basis points of dilution from DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.3%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by a lower current year tax benefit associated with share-based compensation and the prior year favorable impact of the U.S. government issuance of final GILTI tax regulations that provided for a retroactive high-tax exception.
Net earnings rose 11% to $2.6 billion, and diluted EPS increased 12% to $7.24. Earnings per share includes $0.04 accretion from currency translation and $0.05 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration program is wrapping up, with final estimated restructuring charges of $500 million to $515 million, at the top end of our original projections. We are pleased with the progress we achieved from this program.
We realigned our brand portfolio by exiting 4 designer fragrance brands as well as the BECCA and RODIN brands, and we are streamlining our market distribution for Smashbox and GLAMGLOW to improve their long-term viability. We optimized our brick-and-mortar distribution network. We have been and will continue to close underproductive freestanding retail stores as we rebalance our distribution network. By the end of fiscal 2023, we expect to have closed nearly 250 freestanding retail stores under the program.
We've also rationalized department store counters and other retail locations, improving our ability to focus our efforts on driving more profitable omnichannel opportunities in our remaining distribution. We also approved initiatives to optimize our organization across regions and throughout global functions to reduce complexity, leverage our scale and enhance our go-to-market capabilities.
When we are finished executing the program, we expect a net reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 positions globally. We expect to execute the remaining projects to achieve estimated annualized gross savings of between $390 million and $410 million before taxes beginning in fiscal 2024. A portion of these savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in capabilities that sustain our long-term growth, including data analytics, online and advertising.
Turning now to our cash flow. We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior year period. The primary driver was higher working capital due to the end of year disruptions related to the pandemic the past few years as well as inventory to support future growth and to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have faced in certain raw material and componentry areas.
We utilized $1 billion for capital improvements, an increase of approximately $400 million over last year. We continue to invest in capacity and other supply chain improvements. We increased consumer-facing investments to support in-store experiences and recovery markets. We renovated office space, and we continue to invest in information technology.
We also returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace this year as the need for more stringent cash conservation subsided with the progression of the recovery. During the year, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.3 billion, and we paid $840 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase in our dividend rate that became effective in our fiscal second quarter.
All in all, we delivered a strong year despite significant disruptions, including continued outbreaks of COVID, higher inflation, supply chain constraints and the invasion in Ukraine, and we also continue to invest in foundational capabilities for the future, including new production capacity and innovation to support growth.
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we believe that the prestige beauty category has ample opportunities for continued strong growth. Global prestige beauty is expected to grow mid- to high single digits driven by the continued recovery and the gradual reopening of the remaining markets impacted by COVID restrictions. Additionally, we look forward to the continued resumption of international travel, especially in Hainan and the rest of Asia.
We are concerned, however, that the recovery this fiscal year will once again not be a smooth one. Record inflation and the threat of recession or slowdown in many markets could temporarily dampen consumer enthusiasm and is causing some retailers to be more cautious regarding inventories. The strengthening dollar is putting pressure on our international earnings. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions could prove to be disruptive.
With that backdrop in mind, for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 9%. We discontinued 4 designer fragrance licenses at the end of fiscal 2022. These brands generated $250 million in sales in fiscal 2022. In fiscal '23, we will sell some remaining inventory to the new licensees, primarily in the first half. Sales from both years will be excluded from our organic growth figures.
At current levels, currency is projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in fiscal '23 as the U.S. dollar strengthens against key currencies. Based on July 31 spot rates at 1.018 for the euro, 1.215 for the pound, 6.746 for the Chinese yuan and 13.03 for the Korean won, we expect currency translation to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 3 percentage points as well as an additional 1 point due to the impacts of foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets.
There are a few other items impacting our sales growth in fiscal 2023. Our list price increases are expected to add approximately 5.5 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary cost pressures. We take most of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. New distribution, including new doors in existing markets, new markets for certain brands and expansion on new online platforms, could add another 2 points.
Conversely, the loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine are expected to trim about 1 percentage point from sales growth. We plan to continue to drive margin expansion through operational efficiencies and cost savings while fueling additional advertising investment where appropriate.
Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.39 and $7.54 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 5% to 7%. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is also expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 6 percentage points.
At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to fall 4% to 6%. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point, and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 3 points. Our first quarter sales are expected to be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan.
As you may recall, last year, we mentioned that some of our retailers in North America secured holiday shipments earlier due to supply chain concern, contributing 1.5 points to our growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This year, retailers in the U.S. have been tightening their inventories, causing our net sales to trail retail sale.
We expect China and travel retail in APAC to gradually improve throughout the first half of the fiscal year as COVID restrictions lift, and comparisons should ease in the back half of the year as we lap the invasion of Ukraine and the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China.
We expect first quarter EPS of $1.22 to $1.32. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 5 percentage points.
In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our strategy to outpace industry growth. Our multiple engines of growth delivered in fiscal 2022, and we anticipate this more diversified growth can continue in the coming year. And importantly, we continue to reinforce the fundamental drivers of our business that both enable and contribute to continued strong future sales and EPS growth.
I would like to close by extending our heartfelt gratitude to our employees around the globe for continuing to deliver our results during this challenging macro environment.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Are you assuming the city restrictions that are in place today continue throughout Q1? And then what do you assume post Q1 in the balance of the year in terms of lingering shutdowns?
And then second, it's very hard for us to judge externally your underlying market share performance in China ex supply issues. I'm sure it's difficult for you also. But just any perspective on underlying market share trends as supply returns to normal, perhaps so far in fiscal Q1, that'd be helpful. And if you expect any of the supply issues recently to have an impact on your forward share at all."

Our distribution center is open. We're actually -- and opened in June, as we mentioned. So we were well prepared for the 6.18 holiday festival, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. We are still seeing some intermittent shutdowns, not whole city shutdowns in China, at the moment, so that is still disrupting brick-and-mortar retail.
So we have factored that in certainly to our Q1 expectations for the China market. As it relates to Hainan, as we mentioned also in our prepared remarks and I'm sure you all have seen, Hainan is experiencing a lockdown right now, so all of the doors are closed. Courier services as well have been suspended for online orders.
And we're obviously monitoring that day by day, but that is something that began in the month -- at the beginning of the month of August, and right now, we're expecting that to continue through the end of the month of August with some resumption in September, but not full resumption in September, recognizing that as this situation continues to impact the market, there will be some level of reticence for consumers to travel. But we certainly expect that, that will improve in the upcoming months. 
So I think first quarter and first half, we are expecting some level of muted performance in the region related to these issues. We do expect second quarter to be better than first quarter. And then in the second half, obviously, we're anniversarying quite a bit of disruption in the fourth quarter, some of which, began in the third quarter for both Hainan as well as China, and we do expect that we will see strong growth in the second half.
For the full year, we do expect China to grow double digit. And so again, we are -- it is a market that we know there is very strong demand for prestige beauty and for our products, and the same with Hainan as well. So we are just navigating through these first few months of the year until we get on the other side in the second half."

As Tracey just said, we do expect for the full year, China to go back growing double digit. We expect strong recovery in Hainan in the second part, in the second semester of the fiscal year, for sure, a gradual recovery before. That's our assumption, which obviously is going to give us also results in market share.
So speaking about the last -- the quarter 4, to be clear, the market in China was down 10%. Estée Lauder Company was down 13%. So we lost 1 point of market share. We are now at 23%, so very strong market share. I would like to argue that given the lockdown of our distribution center, the impossibility of serving for almost 2 months, our consumers losing 1 point of market share temporarily is actually showing that already in June, we started recovery with an outstanding 6.18 event and the management of this.
And then to speak about what we are going to do further in the next 6 months to recover the market share we lost because of the distribution was down, first of all, strong brand portfolio brands. We are going to reinforce it with the launch of Aveda that just started, which is a very important launch entering the hair care, a big and growing category, the luxury hair care, big and growing category in China. We are going to double down on Tmall and entering new successful online distribution that we started with JD, where we still have opportunity of deploying more brands in other areas where we are testing or distributing.
We have very strong innovation starting with what we discussed in the remarks, which is the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair eye product, which -- eye is one of the most important categories in China, and to be clear, it's one of the most important recruitment strategies, is eye products in the market. As you know, we are opening an R&D center this year, and so we are investing at even stronger innovations in the future.
We are getting a great strategy to win in key shopping moments. I think that what we demonstrated in [indiscernible] in June for the 18.6 event is extraordinary. In our team, we are coming out of 40 days down in Shanghai, and they were able to operate successfully a very complex and important event. We are going to do the same with 11.11, hopefully, now in the second quarter.
We are also improving our distribution in brick-and-mortar. We are opening new cities and new doors in the existing fast-growing cities. We have a new distribution center that we have opened. Actually, we opened this Friday in Guangzhou to mitigate risk of future distribution disruptions, and then this will turn into a definite ongoing new second big distribution center in the beginning of 2023.
We believe the Hainan -- despite the current lockdown, which is obviously painful in the short term, but is a super strong opportunities for the long term, the power of Hainan in the future remain intact, and we have strong presence and market share in this operation. And I want to say we have an amazing local team, and this local team, they've been able to manage through these difficulties extremely well, and we believe that's strength on which we can count in the future to continue building market share over time. Thank you for the question."

We did call out, obviously, in our prepared remarks and in the press release a couple of adjustments in our revenue numbers this year. So we did exit our prestige designer licensed businesses. Basically, we ended those licenses. Our focus is on luxury fragrance and artisanal fragrance. And so we did let those licenses expire. That is about 1 point of growth.
The other point is related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and Ukraine. And so that is also contributing another point, if you will, to adjusted growth and to the suppression of growth that you're referring to. And then lastly, the currency impact on revenue also impacts us in terms of our growth algorithm.
So if you adjust for all of those items, it's about 6 points of difference between what we've guided for the full year and where we expect -- where we would expect to end if none of those events had happened. So that is the reason why the growth looks a bit muted even with the 5.5% pricing.
The other thing I would say again is we are starting the year with a fair amount of disruption as we just spoke about in some of our very important markets. And we are assuming a more gradual recovery, and that, too, impacts our unit growth."

The proof I can give you is that the top of the ranges are growing the fastest also on our brand. La Mer is one of our fastest-growing brands, as an example. So the -- and importantly, the market is very active when there are no restrictions, when there is no issues.

So for the full year, we're expecting gross margins to be around flat at the moment. But the first -- it's a tale of 2 halves in terms of the first half and some of the things we're anniversarying and some of the pressures that we're seeing on the business.

And so fundamentally -- and I know it's important to understand what's going on in gross margin, but really, what we focus on is operating margin.
And as we have seen channel shifts and market shifts, et cetera, those have impacted the gross margin, perhaps in some cases -- in some of those cases, more negatively, but they have impacted the operating margin quite positively. So at the end of the day, we're focused on delivering operating margin and profitable growth. In terms of whether or not we expect that we will get back to higher levels of gross margin, it is something that we are working on with our supply chain.
So between our direct procurement programs, between some of the things we're doing in transportation, the opening of our Japanese plant, which should allow us to be not only closer to the consumer, but even to some of our suppliers for inbound freight should also help us from a gross margin standpoint. I'm not going to commit that we're going to get back to the gross margins that we were at 5 or 6 years ago, but do know that there are things that we see that are opportunities that we're also working on in very close partnership with our supply chain."

In terms of makeup, we continue to be quite bullish on the makeup category. We did see a recovery, particularly in our Western markets. So part of the strength that we saw this year, this past fiscal year, in terms of the growth in makeup and the improvement in margin that we saw in makeup was related to recovery, in particular, in brick-and-mortar in our Western markets, so in the Americas as well as in Europe.
We are still challenged a bit in makeup in our Eastern markets because of some of the disruption that's going on, in particular, in brick-and-mortar. And -- but we expect makeup to gradually improve as the disruption in those markets improve, and similar to Western markets, as consumers resume their normal social and professional occasions. So that is our expectation in terms of when we'll get back to fiscal '19 levels for makeup, depending on the disruptions this year.
It may take another year or so. But our makeup brands have fantastic innovation for this year, in particular, the M·A·C brand, but others as well. And so we're very encouraged in terms of makeup. As it relates to the margin, the makeup category has been particularly hit by the pandemic that is now going on for 3 years because of the brick-and-mortar distribution of makeup. 
And in particular, with a few of our makeup brands where services in store are very well loved by our consumers and the in-store experience, that took -- that was a bit of a challenge with doors closed and with traffic down. And traffic is still down in brick-and-mortar. Even in the markets that are in recovery, traffic has not recovered to prior levels, but it's well on its way to do so. 
So I think one of the reasons why we took some of the actions we did with the Post-COVID Business Acceleration program is take a point of view, to your point, of what that will look like when things are stabilized and what the mix between brick-and-mortar and online should be, and took proactive measures to close some underproductive doors, and largely, that will help the makeup category. Most -- many of those doors were makeup doors. Some of them were Origins doors. Some of them were Bobbi doors, actually. So that should continue to help to make up category as volume returns to -- in particular, brick-and-mortar."

So we will see further progress over time, particularly in the East where the COVID lockdowns are still creating issues, not only in distribution, but also in consumer usage of makeup.
The other important thing is that makeup is really, as Tracey explained, is linked to services. And so to have the proper experience, you need critical mass per store. And the critical mass per store is dependent on traffic, as Tracey said. So this is also getting better. The renaissance is, if you want, at the beginning. So more progress is in front of us. And that progress in particular would also impact positively the bottom line and the profitability of the category. So we are in the right direction, and we are not yet done on this."

I'll start on the product innovation. The product innovation is -- was at 25% already last year. This is a very good number, and we believe it's an efficient number. Now it can be 25% or 30%, depending by quarter. But that's, anyway, very powerful in",488,"Yes. I'll start on the product innovation. The product innovation is -- was at 25% already last year. This is a very good number, and we believe it's an efficient number. Now it can be 25% or 30%, depending by quarter. But that's, anyway, very powerful innovation. The thing that we have improved also, the rhythm of innovation. We have innovation really gradually per category, per quarter, per brand in a very sophistic way, market by market to make sure that we can leverage it. And the innovation is strongly supported by sufficient media. And our advertising in total is increasing in fiscal year [ 2030 ] in absolute level.
And that's listed in the current assumptions guidance. And these advertising -- some part of it is guiding the innovation and the innovation results, but also, a lot of our innovation is attracting earned media value in a fantastic way. A good example of this has been MACStacks in the last fiscal year. So it's not only paid media, but it's also earned media that is attached to high-quality innovation. And so some of the high-quality innovation is also efficient from a spending standpoint, for a media standpoint for that reason.
And then finally, innovation is driving pricing because innovation many times is about improving product, improving product performance or entering benefit areas that are more important for the consumer that's willing to pay more. And so we can invest in our standing products that deliver these results and price for these results as well. So it's a combination of factors why innovation is and will continue to be a very strong driver. And if you assume more or less the same percentage of innovation on a growing business, so innovation in absolute will also increase year after year in absolute level.
On distribution, we have opportunities still to increase distribution. And we are doing it particularly online where there are a lot of new online ways to access consumer in efficient and productive way. It's also important to understand that the distribution opportunity at the end is about consumer coverage. It's about covering consumers that have desire today that are not covered.
The best example of this is, for example, in emerging markets, starting from China, as an example, where we are covering 148 cities, but demand comes from 600 cities or more, and we serve the cities where there is no physical distribution value online. This is happening the same in India. It's happening in Brazil. It's happening in Mexico. It's happening in many of the emerging markets. So the new distribution online is covering new consumer in the large majority of cases, and it's very efficient.
There is a lot of opportunity. There is some, which are already in this fiscal year, the fiscal year 2023 assumption, and there are many in the medium and long term that we are studying and prepared to do."

And then if I could just sneak in another question, sort of piggybacking on Bryan's about the distribution -- the targeted expansion of distribution to retailers that provide broader consumer reach. Fairly certain I know what isn't included, but if you could talk a little bit about what that might entail globally and how that -- the channel mix progresses as a result."

So I'll start, Olivia, on the pricing piece. We have a very sophisticated algorithm for pricing. So we do look at price and by SKU, actually, by brand, by SKU, relative to what the brand has defined as the competitive set for that particular SKU when we consider what pricing we're going to take, for instance, on whether it's on a pricing increase on an existing product or even when we introduce a new product. So that's very much taken into consideration.
We also, depending on -- because we have a very broad price tier, obviously, of our products from La Mer and Frédéric Malle and Tom Ford to Clinique and M·A·C and The Ordinary, we also look at for our entry-level prestige brands, the gap to their comparable closest mass brand. And so we are also cognizant of that.
That has served us quite well in those multi-specialty accounts that you're referring to, where our goal continues to be trading consumers up from mass to prestige. And that has worked quite well for us in those particular accounts. And then you had a follow-up question on distribution, I think."

So these reach consumers that were not reached before. And that's why expand our reach. That's the key thing.
So in other words, doesn't -- we try to avoid duplication in distribution as much as possible and maximize consumer coverage. And the key strong benefit that we are getting, as I said, particularly in emerging markets, but that's true everywhere in the world, is the fact that we are getting new consumers into our business and sourcing new consumers from mass into prestige.

So one way we expand distribution is introducing products into a new market, as Fabrizio was indicating, other emerging markets. We introduced The Ordinary into India via Nykaa. So that's one way that we expand distribution, particularly in a market where consumers had not had that opportunity to purchase that product before unless they traveled.
We also expand with our existing retailers. So here in North America, as Ulta and Sephora opened new doors or any other retailer opens new doors, it is our consideration, without being over retailed from a brick-and-mortar standpoint, of expanding in those stores as well. And that's an expanded -- expansion in terms of distribution. So if our retailer opens 20 new doors this year, we will open those doors with them. And so we include that in our distribution. I think I said in my prepared remarks that we expect around 2 points of growth this year from distribution. And largely, it's those types of distribution.
Fabrizio talked as well about pure plays. Pure plays have been a fantastic way for us to actually -- selective pure plays. We're very selective -- to actually reach new consumers, in particular, younger consumers and -- who are shopping more online and maybe shopping on an apparel site online that we have an opportunity to introduce beauty products to and get a new consumer as well as a new shopping occasion as they're shopping for their apparel products. So it's a very thoughtful way that we think about distribution and expanding distribution right now really to focus on reaching new consumers."

Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased complexity, we delivered organic sales, down 5%, in line with our outlook, and adjusted diluted EPS higher than expected. 
Even in these conditions, our multiple engines of growth strategy empower us to seize prevailing growth opportunities. Indeed, we realized outstanding performance in many developed and emerging markets around the world to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia travel retail and domestic China as well as tighter inventory management by some retailers in the U.S. 
To reflect these prolonged and heightened external pressure, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year 2023, most notably for the second quarter. While Tracey will discuss our revised outlook in detail, there are 3 primary drivers. The first is the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restriction in Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. The restrictions are leading to a slower return of tourism versus what retailers had anticipated, resulting in tightening of inventories. While it is significant, this near-term temporary pose does not diminish our deep conviction in Hainan for the long term as it is among the best brand-building destination for new consumers acquisition. 
The second driver is the tightening of inventory by some retailers in the U.S. And the third is the far stronger U.S. dollar. Encouragingly, beyond these headwinds, consumer demand is robust in markets which are emerging from the pandemic, evidenced in the underlying fundamentals of our first quarter results and retail sales growth. 
Our optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty is intact. During fiscal year 2023, we plan to continue investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to grow profitable prestige beauty share. We expect a gradual sequential improvement to low double-digit organic sales growth and high teens adjusted EPS growth on a reported basis in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As these pressures begin to abate, the momentum in other areas of our business builds and our ongoing investments drive growth. 
Let me now share some insights from our first quarter. As while we had headwinds, we also had many bright spots that give us confidence in the second half and beyond. We realized double-digit organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Japan and the U.K. grew strongly, alongside Brazil, India, the Middle East and Thailand, to name just a few. Brick-and-mortar prospered in these markets as we welcome consumers with high-touch services, engaging activations and newness. Domestic China delivered sequentially improving organic sales trends of down single digits driven by excellent growth online, a better performance in brick-and-mortar. 
Our luxury brand, La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty, contributed to online growth as did Aveda and Bobbi Brown, among others. We are very encouraged by the terrific results of our expanded consumer reach on JD and [indiscernible]. From a retail sales perspective in the online channel, we grew nearly twice as fast as prestige beauty in China to gain share. 
In the U.S., our freestanding store accelerated, benefiting from both enhanced omnichannel capabilities and greater demand for our high-touch services, be it artistry at M·A·C or personalization at Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Specialty-multi also performed especially well, powered by traditional stores and enhanced by the partnership of Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's. Clinique, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown led growth. Given excellent results in Ulta Beauty over the last year, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown are further expanding their presence. 
We continue to see promise in the U.S., evidenced in its whole retail sales growth in prestige beauty despite the recession risk and the strong performance our brands delivered in freestanding stores and specialty-multi. We remain committed to investing in innovation, advertising and granular consumer acquisition strategies as we aim to best capture the market growth opportunities. 
Looking at brands globally. 13 brands rose organically, collectively increasing high single digit to represent over half of our organic sales. Among the 13, M·A·C excelled in makeup, La Mer in luxury skin care, Jo Malone London in fragrance and Aveda in hair care, while The Ordinary, our newest brand, appeal to consumers with its authenticity and innovative approach to ingredient transparency. 
Fragrance sales rose an outstanding 18% organically and expanded in every region. Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, KILIAN Paris and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle all contributed, driven by sought-after innovation and heroes as our luxury and artisanal portfolio evolves from strength to strength. 
For example, Jo Malone London's momentum continue with gains balanced across the [indiscernible] innovation served as a catalyst for growth. In China, the new Night Collection resonated beautifully as did the limited edition Brit Collection. Globally, the brand brilliantly leveraged its hero strategy, creatively reimagining the power of English peer and [indiscernible] in a campaign to recruit new consumers. 
Demand for fragrance was even stronger as ongoing supply issues of glass and componentry constraints this still excellent sales growth. Profitability for fragrance improved despite the significant currency headwinds, further evidence of the benefits derived from our strategic pivot to the higher end of the category. 
Hair care double-digit organic sales growth was fueled by increasingly diverse growth engines. We were thrilled to launch Aveda in Mainland China, marking our entry in prestige hair care in the market. 
In the U.S., Bumble and bumble realized gains from strong results in Ulta Beauty at Target and expansions into Macy's. 
In skin care, while the Estée Lauder, Dr. Jart and Origins brands were most pressured by reduced retail traffic and travel in China, several brands still prospered. La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary grew organically driven by coveted heroes and newness to showcase the gains to be had from entry prestige through luxury. 
Innovation also resonated strongly in skin care, which bodes well for the future when these transitory pressures abate. In China, Estee Lauder luxury oriented Re-Nutriv was highly sought-after, and the launch of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliant serum boosted overall demand for the franchise. 
Clinique Smart Clinical Repair gained momentum in China and also in the U.S. as its new moisturizer complemented the regimens popular serum and eye cream, which launched last year. The Clinique Smart franchise benefit its 360-degree marketing campaign of these 3 products, featuring powerful scientific credentials and claims. 
Makeup renaissance was evident as markets both reopened and evolved in recovery. The category growth in emerging market was especially striking a broad-based from Latin America to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia. Makeup also grew in most developed markets in Western Europe, along with Japan and Korea. 
M·A·C had a remarkable quarter, fueling passion for makeup around the world, growing high single digits organically. Consumer embraced its unparalleled artistry, and the brand's innovation proved captivating, especially Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick for the lipstick finish and elevated packaging as well as M·A·CStack mascara. M·A·C's creative marketing activations further contributed to growth. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, the brands TikTok challenges realized results, driving significant new consumer acquisition on Lazada's Super Brand Day, a strong double-digit volume growth across Latin America as over 400 content creators contributed to the campaign. 
Before I close, I'm also pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2022 social input and sustainability report. It features exciting progress, made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. The report also details new goals for electric vehicles, water reduction and responsible sourcing. 
Finally, on the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we were taking to make more progress in our commitment to racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are also reflected in the report. 
In conclusion, the current external pressures are many. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our focus on advancing our long-term growth strategy, further balancing and diversifying our multiple engines and fully leveraging the long-term promise of prestige beauty. We aim for fiscal year 2023 to be another year of progress on our strategy despite the headwinds. 
In the first quarter alone, we set the stage to expand our luxury portfolio, having announced a deal to create Balmain Beauty with the couture fashion house. We extended our consumer reach in productive distribution in high-growth channels to match success across [indiscernible] and continue to strategically expand brands into new countries with Aveda launch in domestic China. We also welcome colleagues into our new China innovation labs in Shanghai, amplifying our ability to best create for the Chinese consumer. And we began limited production for skin care in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. 
I would like to close with my deepest thanks to our employees for their exceptional [indiscernible] amid the complexity of the environment. Your creativity, wisdom and passion are beyond compare. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5%, and earnings per share was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations, and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter. While sales overall met expectations, our mix of sales was different than we expected. In August, our outlook anticipated that first quarter sales would be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan, with gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as the restrictions lifted. However, [indiscernible] on our first quarter sales was greater than we anticipated in Hainan as stores were closed for most of the quarter. And as they reopen, traffic remained quite modest, which resulted in lower shipments due to the anticipation of a slower pace of recovery. 
Our outlook also reflected the comparison to the prior year in the U.S. when certain of our retailers secured shipments earlier for holiday due to supply chains and concerns in stark contrast to the tightening of inventory by retailers this year due to concerns about slower traffic. Our actual results for the quarter reflect even tighter-than-expected inventory management with certain retailers in the U.S. These additional headwinds were somewhat offset by a faster pace of recovery in other parts of Asia/Pacific and in EMEA as well as the benefit of strategic pricing actions we took in July and August. 
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%, reflecting the timing of shipments in the prior year as well as the tightening of inventory this year. The timing of shipments in the U.S. contributed 6 percentage points to the overall region's prior year growth. In Latin America, nearly all markets grew double digits, fueled primarily by the strong recovery of makeup. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales declined 5%, primarily due to continued challenges in travel retail and APAC, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%. 
Our global travel retail business declined as the ongoing COVID restrictions in China curtailed travel to Hainan. Stores there were closed for most of the quarter, and traffic has been slow to return, resulting in lower shipments as we support stricter inventory management with certain retailers. Conversely, travel retail sales in European markets and in the Americas rose triple and double digits, respectively, boosted by increasing resumption of professional and personal travel. 
Net sales in the United Kingdom increased with double-digit growth from The Ordinary. Elsewhere in EMEA, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the return of tourism in the region drove growth in many markets led by India, the Middle East and Turkey, and resulted in double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar. 
Organic net sales in our Asia/Pacific region fell 7% due to the ongoing COVID restrictions, impact in brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and travel retail in Korea. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr. Jart's travel retail business. The rest of the region delivered strong net sales growth led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Many markets in the region continued to [indiscernible] as restrictions lifted and traffic returned to stores. 
From a category perspective, fragrance led growth, with organic net sales rising 18%. Strong consumer demand for our brands and innovation drove growth. Our luxury and artisanal brands continue to thrive led by Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Net sales from Clinique rose strong double digits, winning across all regions with the Clinique Happy product franchise. 
Our hair care net sales rose 11% organically. Aveda led category growth driven by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from hero products and strong innovation, including the launch of the Color Control product line. 
Organic net sales in makeup declined 6% driven by the COVID restrictions in China as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of shipments for holiday in the U.S. Net sales rose strong double digits in Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets of EMEA due to strong performance from M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder. M·A·C continues to be an overall top performer driven by the success of both hero products and strong innovation across the foundation, lip and eye subcategories. 
Organic net sales in skin care declined 11%. This category has been the most impacted by the COVID restrictions in Hainan, where skin care accounts for a majority of our business. 
Our gross margin declined 190 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and inflationary pressures in our supply chain. 
Operating expenses increased 250 basis points as a percent of sales driven by the reduction in sales. Operating income declined 29% to $668 million, and our operating margin contracted 440 basis points to 17% in the quarter. 
Diluted EPS of $1.37 decreased 28% compared to the prior year, slightly better than expected as a result of effective cost management. The impacts from foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations and the exit of certain designer licenses negatively impacted diluted EPS by 4% and 3%, respectively. 
During the quarter, we utilized $650 million in net cash flows from operating activities, reflecting increased working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels as well as lower net income. We invested $152 million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements, online capabilities and distribution expansion. We returned $325 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And additionally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. So again, we delivered our overall quarter 1 results as we anticipated. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. While we believe the headwinds that impacted our first quarter results are largely temporary, it is also apparent that both the timing and speed of the stabilization of inflation and recovery from both the pandemic and currency challenges are uncertain. As retailers in Hainan were prepared for a faster recovery of traffic to the island with their inventory levels of our products, we have further modified our shipments to be more in line with the slower retail environment. And although we expect the adjustment to inventory by certain of our retailers corresponding with potentially lower traffic, to continue into the second quarter, particularly in Hainan, we believe this adjustment will subside in the second half as COVID restrictions ease and consumers begin to travel with less safety restrictions in China. Until that happens, ongoing restrictions are expected to result in lower net sales in these areas. 
We also anticipate the tighter inventory management in the U.S. to abate in the second half given the still strong demand for our products at retail. We expect the remainder of our first half performance to be pressured as we navigate through these uncertainties. Despite the headwinds to net sales, we remain confident in the strength of our business strategy and expect to sustain our investments to drive long-term profitable growth. 
We plan to continue to invest in the areas of advertising, innovation, production capacity, consumer engagement as well as new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands. 
For the second half, we anticipate trends to improve sequentially as restrictions are lifted, travel throughout Greater China, including Hainan, progressively resumes and the tightening of inventory subsides in Asia travel retail and in the U.S. We expect continued recovery in various markets in EMEA and Asia/Pacific for the balance of the year. 
Currency is also projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in the second quarter and for the full year as the U.S. dollar has continued to rapidly strengthen against key currencies. As we entered fiscal 2023, we took strategic pricing to mitigate higher-than-normal inflation. Both the magnitude and speed of currency movements experienced thus far, combined with inflation, have further suppressed our expectations for the balance of the year. 
Specifically, based on mid-October spot rates of 0.978 for the euro, 1.122 for the pound, 7.29 for the Chinese yuan and 14.36 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to continue to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the second quarter and for the full year. We expect organic sales for our second quarter to fall 11% to 9%, primarily reflecting the continued risk of disruption in Hainan, leading to further tightening of inventory and continued tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the U.S. 
Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 7 points with an additional 2 points due to the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations. 
The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. 
We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 to $1.29 [ for ] a decline between 60% to 57%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.20 such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 54% and 50%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of approximately 7 percentage points. 
For the full year, we expect organic sales growth to range from flat to up 2%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 6 percentage points, and we expect an additional 2 points of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities and sales from certain designer license exits are each expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. 
We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 16.1%, up 360 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, foreign currency impacts and the strategic investments I previously mentioned. 
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings and less benefit from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.25 and $5.40 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.44 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 21% to 19%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 10 percentage points. 
In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our multiple engines of growth strategy. Despite the temporary external challenges, we plan to continue to invest selectively in strategic priority areas to support the ongoing growth of our amazing brands now and into the future and to gain profitable share globally. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

So can you just give us more detail on how much of the fiscal '23 top line revision is more related to the temporary issues in terms of COVID or inventory issues you highlighted as primary reasons versus a second bucket in terms of underlying demand related to the greater macro pressure, et cetera? It'd be helpful to know how much from each of those buckets is driving the top line revision. 
And then can I just also ask a similar question in regard to '24 earnings? How much of sort of the '23 earnings degradation versus your prior guidance might extend longer term? Is your view that it's more temporary? And I just asked that in relation to what you've talked about recently, which is greater flexibility in ad spend, more agility to respond to market conditions. Just trying to sort of understand how that plays into the longer-term earnings outlook beyond this year and what we're seeing this year."
207221,1771403522,2671753,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Yes. It's a complex question, so there's a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in -- particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this ver",847,"Yes. It's a complex question, so there's a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in -- particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this very difficult external complex times. 
So just to give you an example of this. In North America, our retail was growing in the quarter, mid-single digits. And I could -- I can explain later all the many things, which are going well in this direction. But for example, it's a quarter where our M·A·C brand really demonstrated it is back to growth, with a 22% growth. And for our North America business, to see M·A·C retail coming back so strongly is great news because as you know, Clinique and M·A·C are a big part of the growth potential of our North America particularly business. So great news to have M·A·C back into growing and market share growing brands in our top brands portfolio. 
Then when you look at China and you look at Chinese consumers combined, what was the retail in travel retail and the retail in Mainland, in domestic business, we grew mid-single digits, the retail, despite the inventories tightening issues that we have explained in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So there is an underlying strength. 
Then when you look, for example, to the China domestic recovery from the difficult moment of the Shanghai closure where we couldn't ship for some time, and we have spoken in the last quarter to the fact that we'll be gradually recovering, this -- now the brick-and-mortar remained with less traffic, but we gradually improve the trend. And the decline has been still a decline, but less -- much less than in the previous quarter. And online, where there was no issue of restrictions, we're growing above the market, double than the market, growing again market share in online in China. 
Then we spoke about the fact that we are very encouraged in general by the extraordinary progress in the fragrance business. Now we have taken the strategic decision to focus on the luxury of seasonal fragrances, and they are growing. They are profitable. And they are growing more than double digit, you heard from the numbers, even in presence of a complex supply chain for -- particularly for glass, globally, which reduced the ability to get to the maximum potential in this moment to fully fulfill demand. So more to come also because the supply constraints will abate over time gradually. 
So we have now -- our hair care business is also in the double-digit growth, which is the other engines that we are activating in our effort to balance the growth across the different engines. And the launch in China of Aveda has been a big step of this, but also there is growth in the West, very strongly in our hair care business. 
The other interesting indication is the makeup. Makeup globally, except the lowdowns situations in China and the travel retail issues that we have described. But wherever there is market reopening, makeup is doing very well, and it's continued the recovery. As I said, with M·A·C performance at the center, which make us very, very happy because that's a very important step forward. 
And then we have extraordinary skin care innovation pipeline. Admittedly, the majority of it will come in quarter 3 and in quarter 4, but we will continue on our strong innovation in skin care. 
And then when you look at distribution globally, there are many good news of expanded productive distribution. So the [indiscernible] start in China is very, very promising, and this reflects also in a promising start of 11/11. The distribution in the North America specialty-multi is becoming more and more productive, and we are expanding the productive part of it. In the next year, we'll continue this expansion. And there is also the important concept of expanding our brands in new countries, which technically is new distribution of our brands to new consumers. And obviously, Aveda in China is the big, but it's not the only one. And in quarter 3 and quarter 2, we -- quarter 4, sorry, we will continue with these expansions. 
So just a few examples to give you the sense that we are strong, by category, strong in hair care, strong in fragrances, strong in makeup wherever there is reopening and so strong in the future in the market that will reopen in the future. And in skin care, the large majority of the issue that we are in country is linked to the lockdown and very strong innovation plan to restart growth there. So we remain very confident on the long-term growth. 
Proof of that, last point, is that in the second semester, if you look to our outlook, we are assuming to go back in total in the semester to double-digit growth, but obviously, as we explained gradually in quarter 3 and then more stronger in quarter 4. Tracey?"

And so Dara, obviously, what's impacting us at the beginning of this year are significant unanticipated impacts to the business starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year and continuing into the first quarter with disruptions as it relates to some of the lockdowns and key parts of our business. 
As we think forward and for the outlook that we've provided today, we are expecting some easing, as Fabrizio said, in the second half of the year. And in the fourth quarter, we are expecting further easing. As we think about the construct of the business heading forward and assuming more stabilization of some of these matters, our business is intact in terms of the leverage that we can get, the margin expansion that we can get and the growth that we can get as well. As Fabrizio said, consumer demand is strong. It has been disrupted. We are mindful, as everyone else of, is -- that there could be recessionary pressures in some of our key markets, and we are taking that into account. 
But the flexibility that we've created in our cost structure over the last few years remains intact and certainly positions us well in the future once there is more stabilization in the macro environment for continued strong top line growth and also continued strong margin expansion and EPS growth."

So perhaps I'll just actually take a bit more of a medium, longer-term angle here. Fabrizio, can you just comment on the willingness of the Estée Lauder organization to take some of your brands beyond historical channels or types of interactions with retailers? I think you called out the specialty-multi expansion in the U.S. Clearly, in China, you've expanded with JD and China TikTok. It feels like the organization is certainly becoming more comfortable working with different kinds of channels. 
And I wonder, just in the context of a broader recovery, and certainly, there's going to be a big debate on what is the true earnings power of this organization, I wonder if you can just comment on whether this is true, this concept of sort of expanded comfort with new opportunities and whether you see additional opportunities ahead and where those might be."

No, I think we've been very much focused on having the right level of distribution and focus where the consumer preferences is -- are evolving over the last years.

No, I think we've been very much focused on having the right level of distribution and focus where the consumer preferences is -- are evolving over the last years. We operate in 12 channels now versus basically [ 1 channels ] 15 years ago. And so this comfort is there, and you can see this, first of all, in our online expansion that continues to be -- we have obviously our brand.com that continue to be expanded to more brands, to better sites, to more services in the sites. You have our [ 3PP ], meaning the Tmall model, which is expanding around the world. Also Alibaba is present in different countries, and we are collaborating with them in expanding the model in different countries, Lazada being probably the most evident example at this point to this expansion. We are playing with pure play more and more, and we have many examples, particularly in Europe of this. And obviously, our retail.com continue to be expanded. 
And then in terms of our comfort with specialty-multi, I believe this is not new. We are very comfortable, and there is -- with specialty-multi. We are doing well. We are growing. We have increased our market shares in the channel as well, in North America, but not only in North America, in many other parts of the world, and this is progressing very, very well. 
The other important news in this sense is direct to consumers. So our freestanding stores had a tremendous quarter. And we see the model of freestanding store coming back really strongly wherever there is a reopening and wherever the consumers are really enthusiastic to go back to the brick-and-mortar. And today, our freestanding stores are more efficient and more effective for the many efforts of cost management and the expertise in retail we brought in the company in the last years. So the return of traffic to freestanding stores is very promising. 
Just to give an example, our freestanding stores in the U.S. for fragrance brands, we are plus 33% in the quarter. So very, very strong sign of remaking. And so we will -- the expansion, you said -- you spoke about JD, but I spoke about the win, exactly the Chinese TikTok. and this is a more recent expansion. And the interesting thing is not only we are more comfortable with playing in these channels, but we are winning when we play in these channels. Look at what happened in JD where we -- when we enter, we enter really, really well with a great partnership, great results. So we are definitely continue to manage our distribution in line with consumer preference with the evolution of where the consumers we serve go. However, we will keep in mind that our distribution has to be with high-touch services. It has to be a distribution, which serve the consumer not only with availability of product and pricing, that serve the consumer with our education, customization, care services. And they're focused on building brand equity, building experiences. And they're focusing on building the unique elements of luxury. 
We are a pure play in luxury. So it's not only about distributing wherever there is mass of consumers. It's about distributing with quality, branding and services. And so that focus has not changed, but we have become better in creating these environments in where -- in places where there is more and more consumer traffic. 
Tracey, do you want to add anything?"

And then I guess I'd also, if possible, like a little bit more context around the retailer destocking that you've called out broadly, but particularly in the U.S. as it's not something I think -- I don't think we've heard that from your peers, but certainly a dynamic we've seen across other categories.

And that would be in the January, February time frame. 
As it relates to our channels, channels that have had lower traffic are the ones that we're most focused on in terms of, obviously, our shipments to those channels, so they don't end up over stock so we can bring down some of the stock levels in those channels. So we talked about if you just think about the first quarter, we called out the channels that performed strongly for us in the first quarter. So our specialty-multi channel performed strongly in our first quarter. Online in China performed strongly in our first quarter. So those are the channels that continue to perform strongly for us. Other channels, we are a bit more cautious. Freestanding stores performed strongly for us in the first quarter. And we expect in recovery markets that freestanding stores will continue to perform well. So we will continue, obviously, to supply our freestanding store network. 
Where both ourselves as well as our retailers are a little bit more cautious on some of the traffic trends that are being anticipated, we are being a bit more cautious in terms of how we supply those retailers."

So those are, I would say, the biggest areas of inflation that we're watching. But the supply chain area is one that is a particular focus for us going forward.

And as you think about the China recovery, do you essentially assume a return to more normal conditions by Q4? Is that the way to think about it?"
207221,1771403522,2671753,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Yes. In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So",425,"Yes. In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So those are the 2 key things that needs to evolve because retail growth overall is positive, and it's interesting that retail growth overall is stronger than the economy, the way the economy is being communicated. So the phenomenon that is historically proven that beauty prestige industry grows on average more than the economy, and then we grow on average more than the beauty industry is -- that trend is what we believe will continue to happen in the future. And it's happening as we speak. However, the traffic movements are very different. 
And again, to clarify what, I think, the prepared remarks should have clarified in detail, but take the Hainan situation. Hainan traffic -- the last time, Hainan traffic was, if you want, regular, was January, February, last January, February, where it was full normal traffic. Then after the first lockdown, went down 80%. And then in July, recovered and went to minus 30. And there was the assumption that this roughly over time would continue to go well. But then on the contrary, now is -- in October, was still minus 70 again. So basically, it's the expectation of future traffic that make the inventories presence too high for that level of traffic and need to be readjusted. 
And the second factor is that traffic at minus 70 is obviously much less than what originally was expected and also in terms of consumption. But on the other side, there is more consumption online. There is more growth online. There is people that are going through channels. So in total, we have seen, as I said before, a mid-single-digit growth even in this traffic situation with reduced traffic levels. So when the traffic will recover in brick-and-mortar, both in travel and in domestic, when this will happen, the retail should further improve, further increase and be pretty positive. And we do assume that this phenomenon will be more visible in our quarter 4. So in the April, June period is when we assume there will be a rebuild of traffic. And that between now and then, as we explained, will be -- we don't see a lot of improvements in quarter 2, but we then see a start of gradual improvement also in quarter 3. That's the dynamic we are seeing."

Second question, is Europe the next shoe to drop like in terms of destocking? 
And then lastly, you have multiyear plans. I'm not asking for multiyear guidance. But as you think about like what you thought your earnings power may be in fiscal '24, fiscal '25, how has that changed in light of all the dynamics that you're discussing today?"

In terms of Hainan, no, we don't anticipate that Hainan will be fully back to normal in Q4. Much improved, but not fully back to normal. And so we are now looking at fiscal '24 for traffic to recover. And again, it's a guesstimate",553,"So let me start, Jason. In terms of Hainan, no, we don't anticipate that Hainan will be fully back to normal in Q4. Much improved, but not fully back to normal. And so we are now looking at fiscal '24 for traffic to recover. And again, it's a guesstimate at this point in time. So the recovery, obviously, has been slower than I think all of us have anticipated, but we do know that there is a commitment by the retailers in Hainan and certainly the area in general to get back to fantastic growth. They just opened a new mall. So it is still an exciting travel destination, and we look forward to the recovery. But it is not fully recovered in our Q4 thoughts right now for fiscal '24. 
In terms of Europe, Europe, as we said in our prepared remarks, is recovering. And so we have seen strong growth in Europe, particularly in emerging markets in Europe. We are seeing makeup recover. We're seeing strong fragrance growth. And the one category that has been a bit slower really in all of our markets has been skin care, but we've got strong innovation in the second half of the year and certainly into fiscal '24 that we believe will accelerate our skin care growth. But right now, we do not believe that there are any reasons to be concerned about Europe. 
Obviously, everyone has been talking about a European recession. But I think as many have talked about, and we would say the same, we're not seeing it yet. So that's Europe. 
As it relates to fiscal '24, when you think about this year, really the biggest -- one of the biggest impacts we've had outside of the disruptions in terms of travel retail has been currency. And so our fiscal '24 is dependent on in terms of what we thought before will be impacted by what happens with currency. 
And one of the things that we talked about as well in the prepared remarks, some of our currency impact is adjusted out in our constant currency results and guidance. And some of it is not as it relates to travel retail in particular. And that's a big amount. So as you're looking at our margins and the significant impact on our margins, currency is an impact on our margins. So depending on what happens with currency rates, that influences our outlook for fiscal '24. 
But most importantly, Jason, as it relates to the fundamental health of our business, once these disruptions are behind us, we still are -- feel very strong about, obviously, the strategies that we executed throughout the last couple of years, this temporary impact, and how we have prepared the business for future growth. We're opening new production and R&D facility in Asia that will reduce some of the transport issues. By the way, it will reduce some of the currency issues as well. And so there are many things that we've done over the last few years that have really strengthened our business once we emerge from the disruption that has been extended unfortunately this year, and our teams are managing through with fantastic resiliency. And we are, as Fabrizio indicated, incredibly proud of all of them and what they've been doing to support the business."

It is good to be with you today. Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased comple",1531,"Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased complexity, we delivered organic sales down 5%, in line with our outlook, and adjusted diluted EPS higher than expected.
Even in these conditions, our multiple engines of growth strategy empower us to seize prevailing growth opportunities. Indeed, we realized outstanding performance in many developed and emerging markets around the world to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia travel retail and domestic China as well as tighter inventory management by some retailers in the U.S.
To reflect these prolonged and heightened external pressure, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year 2023, most notably for the second quarter. While Tracey will discuss our revised outlook in detail, there are 3 primary drivers. The first is the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restriction in Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan.
The restrictions are leading to a slower return of tourism versus what retailers had anticipated, resulting in tightening of inventories. While it is significant, this near-term temporary pause does not diminish our deep conviction in Hainan for the long term as it is among the best brand-building destination for new consumers acquisition.
The second driver is the tightening of inventory by some retailers in the U.S., and the third is the far stronger U.S. dollar. Encouragingly, beyond these headwinds, consumer demand is robust in markets which are emerging from the pandemic, evidenced in the underlying fundamentals of our first quarter results and retail sales growth.
Our optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty is intact. During fiscal year 2023, we plan to continue investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to grow profitable prestige beauty share.
We expect a gradual sequential improvement to low double-digit organic sales growth and high teens adjusted EPS growth on a reported basis in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As these pressures begin to abate, the momentum in other areas of our business builds and our ongoing investments drive growth.
Let me now share some insights from our first quarter. As while we had headwinds, we also had many bright spots that give us confidence in the second half and beyond. We realized double-digit organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Japan and the U.K. grew strongly, alongside Brazil, India, the Middle East and Thailand, to name just a few.
Brick-and-mortar prospered in these markets as we welcome consumers with high-touch services, engaging activations and newness. Domestic China delivered sequentially improving organic sales trends of down single digits driven by excellent growth online, a better performance in brick-and-mortar.  
Our luxury brands, La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty, contributed to online growth, as did Aveda and Bobbi Brown, among others. We are very encouraged by the terrific results of our expanded consumer reach on JD and Douyin. From a retail sales perspective in the online channel, we grew nearly twice as fast as prestige beauty in China to gain share.
In the U.S., our freestanding store excelled, benefiting from both enhanced omnichannel capabilities and greater demand for our high-touch services, be it artistry at M·A·C or personalization at Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Specialty-multi also performed especially well, powered by traditional stores and enhanced by the partnership of Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's. Clinique, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown led growth. Given excellent results in Ulta Beauty over the last year, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown are further expanding their presence.
We continue to see promise in the U.S., evidenced in its overall retail sales growth in prestige beauty despite the recession risk and the strong performance our brands delivered in freestanding stores and specialty-multi. We remain committed to investing in innovation, advertising and granular consumer acquisition strategies as we aim to best capture the market growth opportunities.
Looking at brands globally. 13 brands rose organically, collectively increasing high single digit to represent over half of our organic sales. Among the 13, M·A·C excelled in makeup, La Mer in luxury skin care, Jo Malone London in fragrance and Aveda in hair care. While The Ordinary, our newest brand, appeal to consumers with its authenticity and innovative approach to ingredient transparency.
Fragrance sales rose an outstanding 18% organically and expanded in every region. Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle all contributed, driven by sought-after innovation and heroes as our luxury and artisanal portfolio evolves from strength to strength.
For example, Jo Malone London's momentum continue with gains balanced across the regions. Innovation served as a catalyst for growth. In China, the new Night Collection resonated beautifully as did the limited edition Brit Collection. Globally, the brand brilliantly leveraged its hero strategy, creatively reimagining the power of English pear and freesia, in a campaign to recruit new consumers.
Demand for fragrance was even stronger as ongoing supply issues of glass and componentry constrains this still excellent sales growth. Profitability for fragrance improved despite the significant currency headwinds, further evidence of the benefits derived from our strategic pivot to the higher end of the category.
Hair care double-digit organic sales growth was fueled by increasingly diverse growth engines. We were thrilled to launch Aveda in Mainland China, marking our entry in prestige hair care in the market. In the U.S., Bumble and bumble realized gains from strong results in Ulta Beauty at Target and expansions into Macy's.
In skin care, while the Estée Lauder, Dr. Jart and Origins brands were most pressured by reduced retail traffic and travel in China, several brands still prospered. La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary grew organically driven by coveted heroes and newness to showcase the gains to be had from entry prestige through luxury.
Innovation also resonated strongly in skin care, which bodes well for the future when these transitory pressures abate. In China, Estée Lauder luxury oriented Re-Nutriv was highly sought-after, and the launch of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum boosted overall demand for the franchise.
Clinique Smart Clinical Repair gained momentum in China and also in the U.S. as its new moisturizer complemented the regimen's popular serum and eye cream, which launched last year. The Clinique Smart franchise benefit its 360-degree marketing campaign of these 3 products, featuring powerful scientific credentials and claims.
Makeup renaissance was evident as markets both reopened and evolved in recovery. The category growth in emerging market was especially striking a broad base from Latin America to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia, while makeup also grew in most developed markets in Western Europe, along with Japan and Korea.
M·A·C had a remarkable quarter, fueling passion for makeup around the world, growing high single digits organically. Consumer embraced its unparalleled artistry, and the brand innovation proved captivating, especially Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick for the lipstick finish and elevated packaging as well as M·A·CStack mascara.
M·A·C's creative marketing activations further contributed to growth. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, the brand's TikTok challenges realized standout results, driving significant new consumer acquisition on Lazada's Super Brand Day, a strong double-digit volume growth across Latin America as over 400 content creators contributed to the campaign.
Before I close, I'm also pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2022 social input and sustainability report. It features exciting progress, made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. The report also details new goals for electric vehicles, water reduction and responsible sourcing. Finally, on the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we were taking to make more progress in our commitment to racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are also reflected in the report.
In conclusion, the current external pressures are many. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our focus on advancing our long-term growth strategy, further balancing and diversifying our multiple engines and fully leveraging the long-term promise of prestige beauty. We aim for fiscal year 2023 to be another year of progress on our strategy despite the headwinds.
In the first quarter alone, we set the stage to expand our luxury portfolio, having announced a deal to create BALMAIN BEAUTY with the couture fashion house. We extended our consumer reach in productive distribution in high-growth channels to match success across regions and continue to strategically expand brands into new countries with Aveda launch in domestic China. We also welcome colleagues into our new China innovation labs in Shanghai, amplifying our ability to best create for the Chinese consumer. And we began limited production for skin care in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo.
I would like to close with my deepest thanks to our employees for their exceptional commitment amid the complexity of the environment. Your creativity, wisdom and passion are beyond compare. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5%, and earnings per share was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations, and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter.",1851,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5%, and earnings per share was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations, and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter. While sales overall met expectations, our mix of sales was different than we expected.
In August, our outlook anticipated that first quarter sales would be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan, with gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as the restrictions lifted.
However, the impact on our first quarter sales was greater than we anticipated in Hainan as stores were closed for most of the quarter. And as they reopened, traffic remained quite modest, which resulted in lower shipments due to the anticipation of a slower pace of recovery.
Our outlook also reflected the comparison to the prior year in the U.S. when certain of our retailers secured shipments earlier for holiday due to supply chains and concerns, in stark contrast to the tightening of inventory by retailers this year due to concerns about slower traffic.
Our actual results for the quarter reflect even tighter-than-expected inventory management with certain retailers in the U.S. These additional headwinds were somewhat offset by a faster pace of recovery in other parts of Asia/Pacific and in EMEA as well as the benefit of strategic pricing actions we took in July and August.
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%, reflecting the timing of shipments in the prior year as well as the tightening of inventory this year. The timing of shipments in the U.S. contributed 6 percentage points to the overall region's prior year growth.
In Latin America, nearly all markets grew double digits, fueled primarily by the strong recovery of makeup. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales declined 5%, primarily due to continued challenges in travel retail and APAC, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%.
Our global travel retail business declined as the ongoing COVID restrictions in China curtailed travel to Hainan. Stores there were closed for most of the quarter, and traffic has been slow to return, resulting in lower shipments as we support stricter inventory management with certain retailers. Conversely, travel retail sales in European markets and in the Americas rose triple and double digits, respectively, boosted by increasing resumption of professional and personal travel.
Net sales in the United Kingdom increased with double-digit growth from The Ordinary. Elsewhere in EMEA, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the return of tourism in the region drove growth in many markets led by India, the Middle East and Turkey, and resulted in double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar.
Organic net sales in our Asia/Pacific region fell 7% due to the ongoing COVID restrictions impacting brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and travel retail in Korea. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr. Jart's travel retail business. The rest of the region delivered strong net sales growth led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Many markets in the region continue to recover as restrictions lifted and traffic returned to stores.
From a category perspective, fragrance led growth, with organic net sales rising 18%. Strong consumer demand for our brands and innovation drove growth. Our luxury and artisanal brands continue to thrive, led by Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Net sales from Clinique rose strong double digits, winning across all regions with the Clinique Happy product franchise.
Our hair care net sales rose 11% organically. Aveda led category growth, driven by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from hero products and strong innovation, including the launch of the Color Control product line.
Organic net sales in makeup declined 6% driven by the COVID restrictions in China as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of shipments for holiday in the U.S. Net sales rose strong double digits in Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets of EMEA due to strong performance from M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder.
M·A·C continues to be an overall top performer, driven by the success of both hero products and strong innovation across the foundation, lip and eye subcategories. Organic net sales in skin care declined 11%. This category has been the most impacted by the COVID restrictions in Hainan, where skin care accounts for a majority of our business.
Our gross margin declined 190 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and inflationary pressures in our supply chain. Operating expenses increased 250 basis points as a percent of sales driven by the reduction in sales. Operating income declined 29% to $668 million, and our operating margin contracted 440 basis points to 17% in the quarter.
Diluted EPS of $1.37 decreased 28% compared to the prior year, slightly better than expected as a result of effective cost management. The impacts from foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations and the exit of certain designer licenses negatively impacted diluted EPS by 4% and 3%, respectively.
During the quarter, we utilized $650 million in net cash flows from operating activities, reflecting increased working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels as well as lower net income.
We invested $152 million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements, online capabilities and distribution expansion. We returned $325 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and additionally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. So again, we delivered our overall quarter 1 results as we anticipated.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. While we believe the headwinds that impacted our first quarter results are largely temporary, it is also apparent that both the timing and speed of the stabilization of inflation and recovery from both the pandemic and currency challenges are uncertain.
As retailers in Hainan were prepared for a faster recovery of traffic to the island with their inventory levels of our products, we have further modified our shipments to be more in line with the slower retail environment. And although we expect the adjustment to inventory by certain of our retailers, corresponding with potentially lower traffic, to continue into the second quarter, particularly in Hainan, we believe this adjustment will subside in the second half as COVID restrictions ease and consumers begin to travel with less safety restrictions in China. Until that happens, ongoing restrictions are expected to result in lower net sales in these areas.
We also anticipate the tighter inventory management in the U.S. to abate in the second half given the still strong demand for our products at retail. We expect the remainder of our first half performance to be pressured as we navigate through these uncertainties. Despite the headwinds to net sales, we remain confident in the strength of our business strategy and expect to sustain our investments to drive long-term profitable growth.
We plan to continue to invest in the areas of advertising, innovation, production capacity, consumer engagement as well as new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands.
For the second half, we anticipate trends to improve sequentially as restrictions are lifted, travel throughout Greater China, including Hainan, progressively resumes and the tightening of inventory subsides in Asia travel retail and in the U.S. We expect continued recovery in various markets in EMEA and Asia/Pacific for the balance of the year.
Currency is also projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in the second quarter and for the full year as the U.S. dollar has continued to rapidly strengthen against key currencies. As we entered fiscal 2023, we took strategic pricing to mitigate higher-than-normal inflation. Both the magnitude and speed of currency movements experienced thus far, combined with inflation, have further suppressed our expectations for the balance of the year.
Specifically, based on mid-October spot rates of 0.978 for the euro, 1.122 for the pound, 7.29 for the Chinese yuan and 14.36 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to continue to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the second quarter and for the full year.
We expect organic sales for our second quarter to fall 11% to 9%, primarily reflecting the continued risk of disruption in Hainan, leading to further tightening of inventory and continued tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the U.S. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 7 points, with an additional 2 points due to the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations.
The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 to $1.29 for a decline between 60% to 57%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.20 such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 54% and 50%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of approximately 7 percentage points.
For the full year, we expect organic sales growth to range from flat to up 2%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 6 percentage points, and we expect an additional 2 points of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.
The impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities and sales from certain designer license exits are each expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 16.1%, a 360 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, foreign currency impacts and the strategic investments I previously mentioned.
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings and less benefit from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.25 and $5.40 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.44 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 21% to 19%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 10 percentage points.
In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our multiple engines of growth strategy. Despite the temporary external challenges, we plan to continue to invest selectively in strategic priority areas to support the ongoing growth of our amazing brands now and into the future and to gain profitable share globally.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

So can you just give us more detail on how much of the fiscal '23 top line revision is more related to the temporary issues in terms of COVID or inventory issues you highlighted as primary reasons versus a second bucket in terms of underlying demand related to the greater macro pressure, et cetera? It'd be helpful to know how much from each of those buckets is driving the top line revision.
And then can I just also ask a similar question in regard to '24 earnings? How much of sort of the '23 earnings degradation versus your prior guidance might extend longer term? Is your view that it's more temporary? And I just asked that in relation to what you've talked about recently, which is greater flexibility in ad spend, more agility to respond to market conditions. Just trying to sort of understand how that plays into the longer-term earnings outlook beyond this year and what we're seeing this year."

It's a complex question, so there's a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in -- particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this ver",846,"Yes. It's a complex question, so there's a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in -- particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this very difficult external complex times. So just to give you an example of this. In North America, our retail was growing in the quarter, mid-single digits. And I could -- I can explain later all the many things, which are going well in this direction.
But for example, it's a quarter where our M·A·C brand really demonstrated that it's back to growth with a 22% growth. And for our North America business, to see M·A·C retail coming back so strongly is great news because as you know, Clinique and M·A·C are a big part of the growth potential of our North America particularly business. So great news to have M·A·C back into growing and market share growing brands in our top brands portfolio.
Then when you look at China and you look at Chinese consumers combined, what was the retail in travel retail and the retail in Mainland, in domestic business, we grew mid-single digits, the retail, despite the inventories tightening issues that we have explained in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So there is an underlying strength.
Then when you look, for example, to the China domestic recovery from the difficult moment of the Shanghai closure where we couldn't ship for some time, and we have spoken in the last quarter to the fact that we'll be gradually recovering, this -- now the brick-and-mortar remained with less traffic, but we gradually improve the trend. And the decline has been still a decline, but less, much less than in the previous quarter. And online, where there was no issue of restrictions, we're growing above the market, double than the market, growing again market share in online in China.
Then we spoke about the fact that we are very encouraged in general by the extraordinary progress in the fragrance business. Now we have taken the strategic decision to focus on the luxury of seasonal fragrances, and they are growing. They are profitable. And they are growing more than double digit as you heard from the numbers, even in presence of a complex supply chain for -- particularly for glass, globally, which reduced the ability to get to the maximum potential in this moment to fully fulfill demand. So more to come, also because the supply constraints will abate over time gradually.
So we have now -- our hair care business is also in the double-digit growth, which is the other engines that we are activating in our effort to balance the growth across the different engines. And the launch in China of Aveda has been a big step of this, but also there is growth in the West, very strongly in our hair care business.
The other interesting indication is the makeup. Makeup globally, except the lockdowns situations in China and the travel retail issues that we have described. But wherever there is market reopening, makeup is doing very well, and it's continued the recovery, as I said, with M·A·C performance at the center, which make us very, very happy because that's a very important step forward. And then we have extraordinary skin care innovation pipeline. Admittedly, the majority of it will come in quarter 3 and in quarter 4, but we will continue on our strong innovation in skin care.
And then when you look at distribution globally, there are many good news of expanded productive distribution. So the Douyin start in China is very, very promising, and this reflects also in a promising start of 11.11. The distribution in the North America specialty-multi is becoming more and more productive, and we are expanding the productive part of it. In the next year, we'll continue this expansion.
And there is also the important concept of expanding our brands in new countries, which technically is new distribution of our brands to new consumers. And obviously, Aveda in China is the big, but it's not the only one. And in quarter 3 and quarter 2, we -- quarter 4, sorry, we will continue with these expansions.
So just a few examples to give you the sense that we are strong, by category, strong in hair care, strong in fragrances, strong in makeup wherever there is reopening and so strong in the future in the market that will reopen in the future. And in skin care, the large majority of the issue that we are encountering is linked to the lockdown and very strong innovation plan to restart growth there. So we remain very confident on the long-term growth.
Proof of that last point is that in the second semester, if you look to our outlook, we are assuming to go back in total in the semester to double-digit growth, but obviously, as we explained, gradually in quarter 3 and then more stronger in quarter 4. Tracey?"

And so Dara, obviously, what's impacting us at the beginning of this year are significant unanticipated impacts to the business starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year and continuing into the first quarter with disruptions as it relates to some of the lockdowns and key parts of our business.
As we think forward and for the outlook that we've provided today, we are expecting some easing, as Fabrizio said, in the second half of the year. And in the fourth quarter, we are expecting further easing. As we think about the construct of the business heading forward and assuming more stabilization of some of these matters, our business is intact in terms of the leverage that we can get, the margin expansion that we can get and the growth that we can get as well.
As Fabrizio said, consumer demand is strong. It has been disrupted. We are mindful, as everyone else is, that there could be recessionary pressures in some of our key markets, and we are taking that into account, but the flexibility that we've created in our cost structure over the last few years remains intact and certainly positions us well in the future once there is more stabilization in the macro environment for continued strong top line growth and also continued strong margin expansion and EPS growth."

Fabrizio, can you just comment on the willingness of the Estée Lauder organization to take some of your brands beyond historical channels or types of interactions with retailers?
I think you called out the specialty-multi expansion in the U.S. Clearly, in China, you've expanded with JD and Chinese TikTok. It feels like the organization is certainly becoming more comfortable working with different kinds of channels.
And I wonder, just in the context of a broader recovery, and certainly, there's going to be a big debate on what is the true earnings power of this organization, I wonder if you can just comment on whether this is true, this concept of sort of expanded comfort with new opportunities and whether you see additional opportunities ahead and where those might be."

No, I think we've been very much focused on having the right level of distribution and focus where the consumer preference is evolving over the last years. We operate in 12 channels now versus basically 1 channels 15 years ago. And so this comfort is there, and you can see this, first of all, in our online expansion that continues to be strong.
We have obviously our brand.com that continue to be expanded to more brands, to better sites, to more services in the sites. You have our 3PP, meaning the Tmall model, which is expanding around the world. Also Alibaba is present in different countries, and we are collaborating with them in expanding the model in different countries, Lazada being probably the most evident example at this point to this expansion.
We are playing with pure play more and more, and we have many examples, particularly in Europe of this. And obviously, our retail.com continue to be expanded. And then in terms of our comfort with specialty-multi, I believe this is not new. We are very comfortable, and there is -- with specialty-multi, we are doing well. We are growing. We have increased our market shares in the channel as well, in North America, but not only in North America, in many other parts of the world, and this is progressing very, very well.
The other important news in this sense is direct to consumers. So our freestanding stores had a tremendous quarter. And we see the model of freestanding store coming back really strongly wherever there is a reopening and wherever the consumers are really enthusiastic to go back to the brick-and-mortar. And today, our freestanding stores are more efficient and more effective for the many efforts of cost management and the expertise in retail we brought in the company in the last years. So the return of traffic to freestanding stores is very promising.
Just to give an example, our freestanding stores in the U.S. for fragrance brands, we are plus 33% in the quarter. So very, very strong sign [ of remaking ]. And so we will -- with the expansion, you spoke about JD, but I spoke about Douyin, exactly, the Chinese TikTok. And this is a more recent expansion. And the interesting thing is not only we are more comfortable with playing in these channels, but we are winning when we play in these channels.
Look at what happened in JD where we -- when we enter, we enter really, really well. With a great partnership, great results. So we are definitely continue to manage our distribution in line with consumer preference here with the evolution of where the consumers we serve go. However, we will keep in mind that our distribution has to be with high-touch services.
It has to be a distribution which serves the consumer not only with availability of product and pricing, but serve the consumer with our education, customization, care services. And they're focused on building brand equity or building experiences, and they're focusing on building the unique elements of luxury.
We are a pure play in luxury. So it's not only about distributing wherever there is mass of consumers. It's about distributing with quality, branding and services. And so that focus has not changed, but we have become better in creating these environments in places where there is more and more consumer traffic."

But is there a rate of overall consumption or retail sales growth that you anticipate across your portfolio in the year, just that we can compare to the flat to 2% positive organic growth that you've assumed in your outlook? That's the question -- kind of follow-up.
And then I guess I'd also, if possible, like a little bit more context around the retailer destocking that you've called out broadly, but particularly in the U.S. as it's not something I think -- I don't think we've heard that from your peers, but certainly a dynamic we've seen across other categories. But so far, beauty hasn't been a focal point for that.

We also anticipated in the prior guidance a secondary price increase, and we are looking at that in light of some of the inflation pressures and looking at taking slightly more pricing in certain markets, not across all markets. And that would be in the January, February time frame.
As it relates to our channels, channels that have had lower traffic are the ones that we're most focused on in terms of, obviously, our shipments to those channels, so they don't end up overstock so we can bring down some of the stock levels in those channels. So we talked about if you just think about the first quarter, we called out the channels that performed strongly for us in the first quarter. So our specialty-multi channel performed strongly in our first quarter. Online in China performed strongly in our first quarter. So those are the channels that continue to perform strongly for us. Other channels, we are a bit more cautious.
Freestanding stores performed strongly for us in the first quarter. And we expect in recovery markets that freestanding stores will continue to perform well. So we will continue, obviously, to supply our freestanding store network. Where both ourselves as well as our retailers are a little bit more cautious on some of the traffic trends that are being anticipated, we are being a bit more cautious in terms of how we supply those retailers."

In other parts, we actually see it moderating. We've seen wage inflation as well. And again, that has been incorporated in some of the pricing that we've anticipated this year.
We have seen advertising rates stabilize a bit, and so we're not seeing as much media inflation as we were seeing previously. So those are, I would say, the biggest areas of inflation that we're watching. But the supply chain area is one that is a particular focus for us going forward. And again, one of the great things about our category, we do have pricing power. And so we have certainly exercised that where we see the inflationary impacts."

And so now we are also looking with the next consideration of possible price increases in January, February to see if in selective markets where there is also a big pressure of currency, not only of inflation, we can also make some selective adjustments in these areas.
But our goals remain to offset most of the price -- most of the inflation repricing, and then the rest, we are doing things like, for example, our innovation has been higher price on average and focused well on protecting gross margin, our cost savings, and many of our cost activity are contributing to covering the overall impact of inflations.

In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So",423,"Yes. In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So those are the 2 key things that needs to evolve because retail growth overall is positive, and it's interesting that retail growth overall is stronger than the economy, the way the economy is being communicated.
So the phenomenon that is historically proven, that beauty prestige industry grows, on average, more than the economy, and then we grow on average more than the beauty industry is, that trend is what we believe will continue to happen in the future. And it's happening as we speak. However, the traffic movements are very different.
And again, to clarify what, I think, the prepared remarks should have clarified in detail, but take the Hainan situation. Hainan traffic -- the last time, Hainan traffic was, if you want, regular, was January, February, last January, February, where it was full normal traffic. Then after the first lockdown, went down 80%. And then in July, recovered and went to minus 30.
And there was the assumption that this traffic over time would continue to go well. But then on the contrary, now is, in October, we're still minus 70 again. So basically, it's the expectation of future traffic that make the inventories presence too high for that level of traffic and need to be readjusted. And the second factor is that traffic at minus 70 is obviously much less than what originally was expected and also in terms of consumption.
But on the other side, there is more consumption online. There is more growth online. There is people that are going through channels. So in total, we have seen, as I said before, a mid-single-digit growth even in this tough situation with reduced traffic levels. So when the traffic will recover in brick-and-mortar, both in travel and in domestic, when this will happen, the retail should further improve, further increase and be pretty positive.
And we do assume that this phenomenon will be more visible in our quarter 4. So in the April, June period is when we assume there will be a rebuild of traffic. And that between now and then, as we explained, will be -- we don't see a lot of improvements in quarter 2, but we then see a start of gradual improvement also in quarter 3. That's the dynamic we are seeing."

Second question, is Europe the next shoe to drop like in terms of destocking? And then lastly, you have multiyear plans. I'm not asking for multiyear guidance.

And so we are now looking at fiscal '24 for traffic to recover. And again, it's a guesstimate at this point in time.
So the recovery, obviously, has been slower than I think all of us have anticipated, but we do know that there is a commitment by the retailers in Hainan and certainly the area in general to get back to fantastic growth. They just opened a new mall, so it is still an exciting travel destination, and we look forward to the recovery. But it is not fully recovered in our Q4 thoughts right now or fiscal '24.
In terms of Europe, Europe, as we said in our prepared remarks, is recovering. And so we have seen strong growth in Europe, particularly in emerging markets in Europe. We are seeing makeup recover. We're seeing strong fragrance growth. And the one category that has been a bit slower really in all of our markets has been skin care, but we've got strong innovation in the second half of the year and certainly into fiscal '24 that we believe will accelerate our skin care growth.
But right now, we do not believe that there are any reasons to be concerned about Europe. Obviously, everyone has been talking about a European recession. But I think as many have talked about, and we would say the same, we're not seeing it yet. So that's Europe.
As it relates to fiscal '24, when you think about this year, really the biggest -- one of the biggest impacts we've had outside of the disruptions in terms of travel retail has been currency. And so our fiscal '24 is dependent on in terms of what we thought before will be impacted by what happens with currency.
And one of the things that we talked about as well in the prepared remarks, some of our currency impact is adjusted out in our constant currency results and guidance, and some of it is not as it relates to travel retail in particular. And that's a big amount. So as you're looking at our margins and the significant impact on our margins, currency is an impact on our margins. So depending on what happens with currency rates, that influences our outlook for fiscal '24.
But most importantly, Jason, as it relates to the fundamental health of our business, once these disruptions are behind us, we still are -- feel very strong about, obviously, the strategies that we executed throughout the last couple of years, this temporary impact, and how we have prepared the business for future growth. We're opening a new production and R&D facility in Asia that will reduce some of the transport issues. By the way, it will reduce some of the currency issues as well.
And so there are many things that we've done over the last few years that have really strengthened our business once we emerge from the disruption that has been extended unfortunately this year, and our teams are managing through with fantastic resiliency. And we are, as Fabrizio indicated, incredibly proud of all of them and what they've been doing to support the business."
