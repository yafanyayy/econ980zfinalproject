Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3%, excluding divestitures. We continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the U.S., and comp transactions were positive. Consumer demand during the quarter was strong, and the team overcame a number of challenges in the U.S. and around the world to deliver these strong results. 
Going into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products and the prices to deliver, and we did. Our inventory position improved and we delivered high sell-throughs in seasonal categories across markets. Food, consumables and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandise in the U.S. against strong results last year. And Sam's Club saw broad-based strength across categories in the U.S. and in China. Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and shareholders in mind. 
I like how we're mixing out the business. Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart U.S. We're working closely with our suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices, and we're paying close attention to how we manage our opening price point items. 
Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share and deliver against our top and bottom line growth algorithm. 
Our associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season, even as we faced Omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter's COVID leave peak was larger than anything we had experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates than our plan called for to help fill that gap which negatively impacted expenses, but it was clearly needed. I'm grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our customers and members during the quarter. As I visit stores and clubs, it's inspiring to see how our team is navigating such a fluid environment. They're delivering tremendous growth while making significant progress against our longer-term strategy. 
During the fiscal year just ended, excluding divestitures and, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%, invested $13 billion in CapEx to grow our business, returned $16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, grew our advertising business globally to $2.1 billion and took important steps to build our U.S. financial services capabilities with agreements to make 2 key acquisitions. 
Sometimes it feels like 2020 and 2021 were just 1 long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal '21 through the end of fiscal '22 excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue, 31% larger in terms of operating income. And globally, our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%. As the company grows, we're fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year. Our strategy is coming to life. 
Ensuring that we deliver our strategy is where I invest the majority of my time. It starts with the customer and earning primary destination. The big-basket stock-up trip is important. It's foundational to our relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart+ and in-home members in the U.S. Our membership offering, Walmart+, continues to be an important piece of what we're building. We're adding capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year and we expect to increase capacity by another 35% this year. For Walmart In Home, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to about 30 million homes in the U.S., up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we're creating roles for more than 3,000 associate delivery drivers. The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We'll be building out a fleet of all electric delivery vans to support our delivery services and our goal of a 0 emissions logistics fleet by 2040. 
Our flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a healthy mix of merchandise and services for our business. Recently, we shared some news about our fintech start-up in the U.S. that will operate under the One brand going forward. The combined talent of our JV leadership team and out of the pending acquisitions of One Finance and even is impressive, and our plans are aggressive. We can help our customers and Walmart+ members save money, have an experience with less friction and help strengthen the financial position for millions of families. 
As with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India is growing incredibly fast, and we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us. 
As we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our marketplace is important. We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the U.S. last year and expect to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We're now up to nearly 170 million SKUs, and we're adding more every day. We opened up our U.S. marketplace to sellers from India and created a dedicated team there to help sellers onboard and grow. Many sellers are looking to diversify their business and they're pushing us to add capabilities, including the expansion of our fulfillment services. 
We grew our U.S. GMV delivered by our fulfillment services by 500% last year. We expect the robust growth will continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our fulfillment services represented 44% of total marketplace orders in India and 22% in Mexico. 
Growing our marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow and enhances our profit margins. Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity so customers have access to more items faster. It's clear to me that we have years of profitable marketplace and fulfillment services growth ahead of us. 
Staying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses, we recently launched Walmart Go Local, a last-mile delivery solution using our Spark driver platform to help businesses of all sizes to reach more customers. Go Local is making deliveries for The Home Depot and other large retailers, but I'm most excited about serving small local retailers. We have nearly 1,000 Go Local service pickup points, and we expect to end this year closer to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients and for us as we lower the cost per order by increasing the combined order size and the route density. 
As we bring more customers, sellers and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships. A great example is our advertising business. Globally, it's been growing at a high rate with high margins and is now a $2.1 billion business in only a few years, and we expect this strong growth to continue. And as our eCommerce business, including marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We're taking the learnings from the U.S. and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada and Chile. Importantly, we're beginning to build tech platforms that can be leveraged in multiple countries. Our strong team of technologists and our digital transformation enable global synergies. 
We see traction in our core business as well as in our newer businesses. There's real power in the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing. To design them such that 1 portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it's easy and intuitive. Connecting B2B opportunities like advertising enables us to grow earnings and make key investments at the same time. 
Because of how the flywheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top line growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. We've highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain and wages, and some of these costs are likely to continue through part of this year, but I feel confident in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we're building is becoming more impactful for our customers and members, more digital, more automated and more diversified on the top and bottom lines. 
Now let's move on to our performance by operating segment. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. The team had a great holiday season. They drove comp sales of 5.6%. You know about our strength in food and consumables, but despite the supply chain challenges, the seasonal hardlines execution for holiday looked good in stores. We're continuing to navigate cost pressures and in-stock challenges, but overall, I'm really proud of the team for delivering the holiday season, and I believe we'll work our way to an improved in-stock level through the course of the year. 
Building a seamless omnichannel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our stores have become hybrid. They're both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year, and that's on top of more than 500% from the year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we're getting items to customers in hours rather than days. 
In Sam's Club U.S., the momentum continues. Sales and membership were strong. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comps were 10.8% for the quarter and nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Membership income grew 9.1%, driven by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter. The team leveraged operating expenses and grew operating income 24%, excluding fuel. They had another fantastic quarter and year. Sam's continues to drive digital innovation and add capabilities. Our bold and blue club remodels and our strengthened pickup and delivery services will drive growth. 
At Walmart International, we had another strong year with good progress in all aspects of the flywheel Overall, sales were strong again in Q4 with growth of 9.8% in constant currency, excluding divestitures. China, Mexico and Flipkart led the way. 
Our 21% e-commerce penetration is a new record and up nearly 400 basis points from last year. We get to serve a spectrum of holidays and festivals during the holiday quarter from Diwali and Big Billion days in India through to preparation for Chinese New Year. During Big Billion days, 40% of sellers were first-time sellers on the marketplace, and more than 100,000 participated by making last mile deliveries. This is strong, inclusive growth. 
While our omnichannel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important. We're expanding our ecosystem, and we've made investments in areas such as health care, marketplace, telecommunications and our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of Flipkart Health Plus that aims to increase access to affordable care in India and the acquisition of Food Maestro in Canada to build more personalized shopping experiences for customers. And BAIT our value-based Internet and telephone service that enables customers in Mexico to enjoy digital connectivity surpassed 2 million members. 
It's great to see all 3 of our operating segments doing so well. I'm grateful to our strong and capable leadership team and to all of our associates. We've had an incredible couple of years during these challenging times. We have momentum in the business. We have aggressive plans, and we're executing on the strategy it still feels like we're just getting started. 
I'll now turn it over to Brent."

We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start the new year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges, but I'm proud of how we've navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different as we faced the rise of Omicron with its impact on the supply chain and our associates. This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses, but despite that, we delivered the top and bottom line results we expected. 
We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to fulfill the vision we outlined last February. U.S. flywheel is accelerating and is evident through initiatives like our pending Fintech JV acquisitions, the launch of a new data business and acceleration of last-mile delivery. Sam's growth in membership income has been strong throughout the year as we expand omni options, including Club Pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years. 
For the full year, we had record sales of $568 billion with increased traffic to stores and clubs, while e-commerce penetration approached 13%. Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $23 billion and saw strong market share gains in food and consumables. Over the past 2 years, our U.S. segments have grown sales by $67 billion or 17% and operating income by 25%. 
Now let's discuss Q4 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestiture significantly affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net sales exceeding $150 billion. Consolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points with Walmart U.S. gross margin rate increasing by a healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases and mix along with benefits from a growing advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Supply chain costs were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate over time. 
International gross margin rates were lower due primarily to format mix. SG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis points as increased U.S. wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year. Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we had significantly higher associated leave costs in the U.S. than anticipated. In the first 3 quarters combined, COVID leave costs were about $600 million. but increased over $450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million. 
Despite these expense challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%. We're in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital towards both growth and shareholder returns. Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the year, higher CapEx and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year with buybacks of just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long-term value of the company. 
In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis points to just under 15%, the best level in 5 years due primarily to growth in operating income. 
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had its first ever $100 billion-plus sales quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a 2-year stack. We continue to grow grocery market share as food comps increased high single digits, while health and wellness, apparel, seasonal and automotive categories were also strong. Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures. E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% 2-year stack. 
We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken prudent steps to manage pricing while having slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic. We have a good balance of growing market share while managing price with both customers and shareholders in mind. 
We continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher-margin initiatives. Walmart Connect advertising experienced robust sales growth this year with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year-over-year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years with plans to become a top 10 ad business in the midterm. 
Growing eCommerce marketplace at WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we've invested to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers and double the number of items available for customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our e-commerce assortment by the end of the year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart's marketplace. 
Customers increasingly want home delivery, and we had a sixfold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter versus pre-pandemic levels. We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of in-home delivery to 30 million households by year-end. We also announced our new FinTech business one in January, with the pending acquisitions of Fintech platforms One Finance and Even. 
SG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower total COVID-related expenses year-over-year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much higher than expected. Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins, as well as solid growth in membership and other income. Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix and higher-than-normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock. 
International sales were strong, up nearly 10%, led by China, Mexico and Flipkart as seasonal events, omni growth and good inventory position contributed to results. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on top of strong gains last year with growth of more than 75% on a 2-year stack. China comps increased nearly 20% in constant currency with continued strength from Sam's Clubs as well as more than 90% growth in eCommerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD. 
Flipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with TPV of more than 130% versus last year with a current run rate of $650 billion. In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping and comps increased more than 13% on a 2-year stack. 
International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and eCommerce. For the full year, International adjusted operating income grew 12.7%, and we feel confident about our international business as we head into the new year. 
Sam's Club had another impressive quarter with comps up 10.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 7% and ticket was up 3.2%. eCommerce sales grew 21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter. Sam's is leveraging Walmart's Go Local last-mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members. 
Membership income was up more than 9% with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration. Operating income was up 41% as higher fuel and membership income as well as strong expense leverage were partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can deliver full year growth in FY '23 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year. As you saw in Q4, we're still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the U.S. consumer remains in a generally favorable economic position throughout the year. 
The comparisons against last year is unique, primarily due to the timing of international divestitures and U.S. stimulus in FY '22. As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the U.K. and Japan were completed near the end of the first quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1 FY '22. Our guidance will be ex divestitures. 
We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year. We expect FY '23 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY '22 adjusted EPS due in part to our aggressive share repurchase program. 
The quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable due to last year's U.S. stimulus as well as lapping wage investments initiated in February and September 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a 2-year stack. We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low double digits to low teens as we cycle the stimulus effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth, as well as increased wages this year. On a 2-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage. Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single-digit rates as year-over-year comparisons ease due in part to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year. We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year as we fully cycle wage investments resulting in fourth quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high teens percentage. 
Q4 operating income will also benefit from some timing versus FY '22, particularly in international as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in FY '22. Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix. 
For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix and new business initiatives, although there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as is usually the case. For the first time in a while, we expect some expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain wage and tech costs. We'll continue the multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation and technology to enhance productivity. 
FY '22 CapEx was about $13.1 billion, lower than anticipated due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's CapEx being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales. 
In closing, I'm really pleased with our FY '22 results. I'm very confident as I look to this year and to the future. The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals, benefiting shareholders. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

When it comes to pricing, we really take a long-term view on this, and we manage pricing for both customers and shareholders. We're constantly monitoring our share, our price gaps to competitors. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward. And then what we're seeing right now is not only gaps that we're proud of that are valuable for our customers, but we're also seeing the opportunity to increase some of our rollbacks in stores, and we're really proud of the team.

They help us keep prices low for customers and they help us deliver the operating income number percentage. So we're excited about what the future looks like as it relates to the growth of the advertising business. 
We're not going to share Walmart+ yet. I don't really want to have the company defined by one metric. And with subscriptions being such a topic these days, everybody gets really focused on that. Walmart is always going to be a business where you need to look across and see how the omnichannel business is playing out. There are going to be times when eCommerce grows faster than stores. And as we've seen recently, stores are attractive during certain periods of time. Walmart+ is important. It helps us grow our eCommerce business. It helps us deepen the relationship with customers and have more data. And at some point, we'll probably talk about that number. And by the way, there are other types of memberships, not just in Sam's Club across the world, but in some of our other businesses, too, that are growing. So I think there will probably be a number of membership type metrics over time that you'll want to keep an eye on. But I don't think it would be good if we're going to get overly focused on Walmart+.

And the Walmart Connect business, specifically the reason we named it Connect is we're connecting buyers, sellers, suppliers and customers. And we have a unique opportunity to be able to help sellers and suppliers reach customers in a way that's effective for them, grow their business and do it in a way that is positioned on top of an omni retail platform. So certainly, excited about the growth, I'm excited about the capacity additions in store and in Walmart Fulfillment Services. Those enable sellers to be able to transact more frequently with our customers. And that's really the key to the growth of advertising is have the large seller and supplier base that can reach our customer base."

But I think we've demonstrated over time that we have a lot of really good managers at Walmart. 
In terms of upside, I mean I'm excited about what's happening in our stores and clubs. We've got great momentum in Sam's. There's a lot to be excited about in international. India continues to be really exciting. Walmex is kind of going from strength to strength Sam's business in China is good. So I think that Sam's International can contribute. And then the Walmart U.S. side, John, you can jump in here, too. I think we've got a opportunity to continue to improve both stores and eCommerce. And the fact that we're now up to 170 million items for customers is exciting and the way sellers are responding to fulfillment and seller services, and that relationship is really encouraging. So I think marketplace is one of those areas where we can see growth, including that last mile component that we're building out. I think that's exciting too."

And these are components that will help customers, number one, they'll help shareholders and they'll help us position the way that we offer value to customers all across the country. So at Go Local, we talked about the number of points that we have today. That's expanding. Our Last Mile business is expanding. We'll have a fleet of electric vehicles coming online over the next couple of years. So a lot going on that is going to take a lot of friction out of customers' lives, help them stay in stock at home. And then with the improvement in fundamentals over the next year. I'm also very excited about our ability to manage through whatever external forces that we see. We've got a lot of experience doing this. We've got great teams that are ready for this.

That's a big number on top of what we've already done. So it could be sales driven, and it can continue to be margin driven as well as these new businesses develop as our general merchandise business gets stronger, which helps with mix. It's all of those things. And we always talked about there's so many levers that we can pull at different times when we need to. It's also all those levers that can actually play to our advantage in any given year at any given time. So I just feel good about the momentum of the business. I'm a -- I said this this morning, I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about the business and the shape of the business model. 
To answer Q4 specifically, there's a couple of things. There's some holiday timing in international. We also had some impacts of some impairments this quarter, some of that was adjusted out. But it's those things, but also the cost. When you look at the supply chain costs and the COVID costs in Q4, that's big change, and we do expect some abatement of costs over the year.

So I think that's a clear reflection of the number of choices that we offer customers. We offer customers experience through Walmart.com and e-commerce. We offer customers pickup experiences, we offer in-store and just about everything in between, including home delivery, which will expand to a significant number of households up to 30 million households this year. So I think our ability to serve all across is quite important going forward. And for the team this year, we'll be really focused on execution.

A couple of strengths that really stood out were the apparel business and our Health & Wellness business were both strong throughout the quarter. Those resulted -- due to demand, those resulted in pretty decent sell-throughs. And then in January, with the effects of Omicron, we took a step back in in-store in-stock and the line. But what we're seeing right now is better flow through all across the supply chain. You heard the increase in inventory, a large reflection of what is inbound. So we see recovery have pretty quick. There are a couple of categories in the store that you'll see some out of stocks that are really national issues. And as far as the supply chain, we talked about it in Q3. There were some significant improvements in flow-through at ports, changing lead times, getting containers moved into the country and that's all helped. But just a reminder, about 2/3 of what we sell is manufactured or assembled here in the United States. And we see growth across those categories as well.

So the business model, the income statement is just changing shape. And I think that kind of the headlines are the company is becoming more digital it is starting to become more automated and over time will become even more automated. And when you look at the gross margin number, we can manage it. Some of you like to watch gross margin as, I guess, makes sense quarter-to-quarter. As Brett was reminding us yesterday, you can drive yourself crazy doing that. Gross margin over time, I mean, look at our track record, we can manage gross margin. Now then below gross margin, we've got productivity opportunities and technology, whether it's an app in a store for an associate on the sales floor or robotics in a distribution center creates an opportunity for productivity over time. That is helpful. And then you get to these other businesses like the advertising business, the last-mile delivery business, fulfillment services for eCommerce, the marketplace itself. And these are helpful businesses from a margin point of view. And as they become a larger percent of total, the shape of the income statement changes. And our confidence in that, not only in the U.S. but around the world, in the markets we operate in is high, and so that's why you sense that confidence from us.

And this key, as I mentioned in my remarks, of stitching it together whether it's fintech or health care, and John, you should jump in on future shopping, fintech and health care, too. The way you stitch that together so that 1 business becomes a default for the other is the magic of it. I mean if we can really become great from a financial services point of view, we can take out friction and cost for customers, make it more delightful to transact with us. Not even really think about transacting, John, as we've changed shopping experience as it relates to checkouts in the future as well as on our app and in other digital forms."

I see the way Doug is very excited to see some of the changes because the consumer, which historically in the past, you might have thought of as the consumer fits in the segment, consumers segment, depending on the day or the week or the hour of the day. Consumers sometimes need things right away, which we can do in under 2 hours of express delivery, they may need a pickup order in a couple of days, and they may need something for our kids birthday party this weekend, and we can work with all of those. And that's really exciting. 
On fintech and health care, specifically, those are on our flywheel for important reasons. One, in fintech, we're excited about the potential acquisitions that we mentioned pending regulatory approval. But we're looking for modern, innovative ways to offer customers the ability to access affordable financial solutions and financial products a considerable number of customers, including middle income customers, are underserved when it comes to financial services, and we believe that we have a role that can help there and we get it in a way that's digital. 
And then just going on to health and wellness, it's a big question with all these things that you have in there, but the health business was our fastest-growing comp business in Q4. We are excited about continuing to be able to serve customers at the pharmacy. Our pharmacists and pharmacy techs have done a tremendous job this last year in serving customers. And we're seeing with the addition of things like our telehealth company, other services, the ability for our pharmacists and tech to practice at the top of their licenses and really help customers live better. So you put all this together, all of these opportunities really do position the company to live through its purpose. And that's to help customers money so they can live better in the combination of retail, financial services and health and wellness do that really well."

So I'd say I was just -- I was in the store across the street early this morning, and we've got rollbacks in consumer electronics and parts of dry grocery. And those values really matter as customers become more concerned and they think more about inflationary pressures. So we'll continue to be an everyday low-price retailer. That's our platform.

We think about things like opening price points and protecting for a lower income family some of the things that they need from a staples point of view.

Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3% excluding divestitures. We continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the U.S., and comp transactions were positive. Consumer demand during the quarter was strong, and the team overcame a number of challenges in the U.S. and around the world to deliver these strong results.  
Going into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products and the prices to deliver and we did. Our inventory position improved, and we delivered high sell-throughs in seasonal categories across markets. Food, consumables and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandise in the U.S. against strong results last year. And Sam's Club saw broad-based strength across categories in the U.S. and in China. Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and shareholders in mind.  
I like how we're mixing out the business. Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart U.S. We're working closely with our suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices, and we're paying close attention to how we manage our opening price point items. Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share and deliver against our top and bottom line growth algorithm.  
Our associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season even as we faced Omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter's COVID leave peak was larger than anything we had experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates than our plan called for to help fill that gap, which negatively impacted expenses but it was clearly needed. I'm grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our customers and members during the quarter. 
As I visit stores and clubs, it's inspiring to see how our team is navigating such a fluid environment. They're delivering tremendous growth while making significant progress against our longer-term strategy. During the fiscal year just ended, excluding divestitures, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%, invested $13 billion in CapEx to grow our business, returned $16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, grew our advertising business globally to $2.1 billion and took important steps to build our U.S. financial services capabilities with agreements to make 2 key acquisitions. 
Sometimes it feels like 2020 and 2021 were just 1 long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal '21 through the end of fiscal '22, excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue, 31% larger in terms of operating income. And globally, our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%. As the company grows, we're fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year. Our strategy is coming to life.  
Ensuring that we deliver our strategy is where I invest the majority of my time. It starts with the customer and earning primary destination. The big-basket stock-up trip is important. It's foundational to our relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart+ and InHome members in the U.S. Our membership offering, Walmart+, continues to be an important piece of what we're building. 
We're adding capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year, and we expect to increase capacity by another 35% this year. For Walmart InHome, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to about 30 million homes in the U.S., up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we're creating roles for more than 3,000 associate delivery drivers. The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We'll be building out a fleet of all electric delivery vans to support our delivery services and our goal of a 0 emissions logistics fleet by 2040.  
Our flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a healthy mix of merchandise and services for our business. Recently, we shared some news about our fintech start-up in the U.S. that will operate under the ONE brand going forward. The combined talent of our JV leadership team and out of the pending acquisitions of ONE Finance and Even is impressive, and our plans are aggressive. We can help our customers and Walmart+ members save money, have an experience with less friction and help strengthen the financial position for millions of families.  
As with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India is growing incredibly fast, and we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us.  
As we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our Marketplace is important. We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the U.S. last year and expect to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We're now up to nearly 170 million SKUs, and we're adding more every day. We opened up our U.S. Marketplace to sellers from India and created a dedicated team there to help sellers onboard and grow. 
Many sellers are looking to diversify their business, and they're pushing us to add capabilities, including the expansion of our fulfillment services. We grew our U.S. GMV delivered by our fulfillment services by 500% last year. We expect the robust growth will continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our fulfillment services represented 44% of total Marketplace orders in India and 22% in Mexico.  
Growing our Marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow and enhances our profit margins. Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity so customers have access to more items faster. It's clear to me that we have years of profitable Marketplace and fulfillment services growth ahead of us.  
Staying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses, we recently launched Walmart GoLocal, a last-mile delivery solution using our Spark Driver platform to help businesses of all sizes to reach more customers. GoLocal is making deliveries for The Home Depot and other large retailers, but I'm most excited about serving small local retailers. We have nearly 1,000 GoLocal service pickup points, and we expect to end this year closer to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients and for us as we lower the cost per order by increasing the combined order size and the route density.  
As we bring more customers, sellers and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships. A great example is our advertising business. Globally, it's been growing at a high rate with high margins and is now a $2.1 billion business in only a few years, and we expect this strong growth to continue. 
And as our eCommerce business, including Marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We're taking the learnings from the U.S. and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada and Chile. Importantly, we're beginning to build tech platforms that can be leveraged in multiple countries. Our strong team of technologists and our digital transformation enable global synergies.  
We see traction in our core business as well as in our newer businesses. There's real power in the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing, to design them such that one portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it's easy and intuitive. Connecting B2B opportunities like advertising enables us to grow earnings and make key investments at the same time. Because of how the flywheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top line growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. 
We've highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain and wages. And some of these costs are likely to continue through part of this year, but I feel confident in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we're building is becoming more impactful for our customers and members, more digital, more automated and more diversified on the top and bottom lines.  
Now let's move on to our performance by operating segment. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. The team had a great holiday season. They drove comp sales of 5.6%. You know about our strength in food and consumables, but despite the supply chain challenges, the seasonal hardlines execution for holiday looked good in stores. We're continuing to navigate cost pressures and in-stock challenges, but overall, I'm really proud of the team for delivering the holiday season. And I believe we'll work our way to an improved in-stock level through the course of the year.  
Building a seamless omnichannel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our stores have become hybrid. They're both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year, and that's on top of more than 500% from the year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we're getting items to customers in hours rather than days.  
In Sam's Club U.S., the momentum continues. Sales and membership were strong. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comps were 10.8% for the quarter and nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Membership income grew 9.1%, driven by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter. The team leveraged operating expenses and grew operating income 24% excluding fuel. They had another fantastic quarter and year. Sam's continues to drive digital innovation and add capabilities. Our Bold & Blue club remodels and our strengthened pickup and delivery services will drive growth.  
At Walmart International, we had another strong year with good progress in all aspects of the flywheel Overall, sales were strong again in Q4 with growth of 9.8% in constant currency excluding divestitures. China, Mexico and Flipkart led the way. Our 21% eCommerce penetration is a new record and up nearly 400 basis points from last year. 
We get to serve a spectrum of holidays and festivals during the holiday quarter, from Diwali and Big Billion Days in India through to preparation for Chinese New Year. During Big Billion Days, 40% of sellers were first-time sellers on the Marketplace, and more than 100,000 kiranas participated by making last-mile deliveries. This is strong inclusive growth.  
While our omnichannel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important. We're expanding our ecosystem, and we've made investments in areas such as health care, marketplace, telecommunications and our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of  Flipkart Health+ that aims to increase access to affordable care in India and the acquisition of  Foodmaestro in Canada to build more personalized shopping experiences for customers. And BAIT, our value-based Internet and telephone service that enables customers in Mexico to enjoy digital connectivity, surpassed 2 million members.  
It's great to see all 3 of our operating segments doing so well. I'm grateful to our strong and capable leadership team and to all of our associates. We've had an incredible couple of years during these challenging times. We have momentum in the business. We have aggressive plans, and we're executing on the strategy. It still feels like we're just getting started.  
I'll now turn it over to Brett."

We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start the new year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges but I'm proud of how we've navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different as we faced the rise of Omicron with its impact on the supply chain and our associates. This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses, but despite that, we delivered the top and bottom line results we expected.  
We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to fulfill the vision we outlined last February. U.S. flywheel is accelerating and is evident through initiatives like our pending fintech JV acquisitions, the launch of a new data business and acceleration of last-mile delivery. Sam's growth in membership income has been strong throughout the year as we expand omni options, including Club Pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years.  
For the full year, we had record sales of $568 billion with increased traffic to stores and clubs while eCommerce penetration approached 13%. Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $23 billion and saw strong market share gains in food and consumables. Over the past 2 years, our U.S. segments have grown sales by $67 billion or 17% and operating income by 25%.  
Now let's discuss Q4 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestiture significantly affect year-over-year comparisons so my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant-currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net sales exceeding $150 billion. 
Consolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points with Walmart U.S. gross margin rate increasing by a healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases and mix along with benefits from a growing advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Supply chain costs were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate over time. International gross margin rates were lower due primarily to format mix. 
SG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis points as increased U.S. wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year. Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we had significantly higher associate leave costs in the U.S. than anticipated. In the first 3 quarters combined, COVID leave costs were about $600 million but increased over $450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million. Despite these expense challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%. 
We're in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital towards both growth and shareholder returns. Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the year, higher CapEx and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year with buybacks of just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long-term value of the company. In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis points to just under 15%, the best level in 5 years due primarily to growth in operating income.  
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had its first ever $100 billion-plus sales quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a 2-year stack. We continue to grow grocery market share as food comps increased high single digits while health and wellness, apparel, seasonal and automotive categories were also strong. Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures. 
eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% 2-year stack. We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken prudent steps to manage pricing while having slightly wider price gaps than pre pandemic. We have a good balance of growing market share while managing price with both customers and shareholders in mind. 
We continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher-margin initiatives. Walmart Connect advertising experienced robust sales growth this year with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year-over-year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years with plans to become a top 10 ad business in the midterm.  
Growing eCommerce Marketplace at WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we've invested to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers and double the number of items available for customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our eCommerce assortment by the end of the year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart's Marketplace.  
Customers increasingly want home delivery, and we had a sixfold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter versus pre-pandemic levels. We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of InHome delivery to 30 million households by year-end. We also announced our new fintech business, ONE, in January with the pending acquisitions of fintech platforms One Finance and Even.  
SG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower total COVID-related expenses year-over-year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much higher than expected. Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins as well as solid growth in membership and other income. Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix and higher-than-normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock.  
International sales were strong, up nearly 10%, led by China, Mexico and Flipkart as seasonal events, omni growth and good inventory position contributed to results. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on top of strong gains last year with growth of more than 75% on a 2-year stack. China comps increased nearly 20% in constant currency with continued strength from Sam's Clubs as well as more than 90% growth in eCommerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD.  
Flipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with TPV of more than 130% versus last year, with a current run rate of $650 billion. In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping, and comps increased more than 13% on a 2-year stack. International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and eCommerce. For the full year, International adjusted operating income grew 12.7%, and we feel confident about our international business as we head into the new year.  
Sam's Club had another impressive quarter with comps up 10.8% excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 7% and ticket was up 3.2%. eCommerce sales grew 21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter. Sam's is leveraging Walmart's GoLocal last-mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members. Membership income was up more than 9% with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration. Operating income was up 41% as higher fuel and membership income as well as strong expense leverage were partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs.  
Now let's turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can deliver full year growth in FY '23 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year. As you saw in Q4, we're still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the U.S. consumer remains in a generally favorable economic position throughout the year.  
The comparisons against last year are unique primarily due to the timing of international divestitures and U.S. stimulus in FY '22. As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the U.K. and Japan were completed near the end of the first quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1 FY '22. Our guidance will be ex divestitures.  
We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year. We expect FY '23 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY '22 adjusted EPS due in part to our aggressive share repurchase program. 
The quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable due to last year's U.S. stimulus as well as lapping wage investments initiated in February and September 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a 2-year stack. We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low double digits to low teens as we cycle the stimulus effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth as well as increased wages this year. 
On a 2-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage. Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single-digit rates as year-over-year comparisons ease due in part to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year. We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year as we fully cycle wage investments, resulting in fourth quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high-teens percentage. Q4 operating income will also benefit from some timing versus FY '22, particularly in international as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in FY '22. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix. For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix and new business initiatives, although there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as is usually the case. For the first time in a while, we expect some expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain, wage and tech costs. We'll continue the multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation and technology to enhance productivity. 
FY '22 CapEx was about $13.1 billion, lower than anticipated due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's CapEx being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales.  
In closing, I'm really pleased with our FY '22 results and very confident as I look to this year and to the future. The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals, benefiting shareholders.  
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

When it comes to pricing, we really take a long-term view on this, and we manage pricing for both customers and shareholders. We're constantly monitoring our share -- our price gaps to competitors, and we'll continue to do that as we move forward. 
And then what we're seeing right now is not only gaps that we're proud of that are valuable for our customers, but we're also seeing the opportunity to increase some of our rollbacks in stores, and we're really proud of the team. We're seeing about the same number of rollbacks now that we had at the end of Q1 last year. So while we have supply chain challenges and other costs coming through, the teams are doing a nice job managing mix and pricing and looking after both our customers and our shareholders."

The business model is changing. I think that's the headline. We've got a business that's becoming increasingly digital. The eCommerce business, first party, third party is growing. It gives us the opportunity to grow advertising income. It's grown at a fast rate, and it's growing across markets. 
The U.S. is important in that number, but India, Mexico and other markets are going to have growth there, too. And the margins are helpful. They help us keep prices low for customers, and they help us deliver the operating income number percentage. So we're excited about what the future looks like as it relates to the growth of the advertising business.  
We're not going to share Walmart+ yet. I don't really want to have the company defined by one metric. And with subscriptions being such a topic these days, everybody gets really focused on that. Walmart is always going to be a business where you need to look across and see how the omnichannel business is playing out. There are going to be times when eCommerce grows faster than stores. And as we've seen recently, stores are attractive during certain periods of time. 
Walmart+ is important. It helps us grow our eCommerce business. It helps us deepen the relationship with customers and have more data. And at some point, we'll probably talk about that number. 
And by the way, there are other types of memberships, not just in Sam's Club across the world but in some of our other businesses, too, that are growing. So I think there'll probably be a number of membership-type metrics over time that you'll want to keep an eye on, but I don't think it would be good if we're going to get overly focused on Walmart+. Our ability to serve people with pickup and delivery has improved as we've made these investments. It's one of the reasons why we continue to tell you how much capacity we're growing to do that."

And we have a unique opportunity to be able to help sellers and suppliers reach customers in a way that's effective for them, grow their business and do it in a way that is positioned on top of an omni retail platform. 
So certainly excited about the growth. I'm excited about the capacity additions in store and in Walmart Fulfillment Services. Those enable sellers to be able to transact more frequently with our customers. And that's really the key to the growth of advertising, is have a large seller and supplier base that can reach our customer base."

In terms of upside, I mean I'm excited about what's happening in our stores and clubs. We've got great momentum in Sam's. There's a lot to be excited about in international. India continues to be really exciting. Walmex is kind of going from strength to strength. Sam's business in China is good. So I think that Sam's International can contribute. 
And on the Walmart U.S. side, John, you can jump in here too, I think we've got an opportunity to continue to improve both stores and eCommerce. And the fact that we're now up to 170 million items for customers is exciting. And the way sellers are responding to fulfillment and seller services and that relationship is really encouraging.

That's a big number on top of what we've already done. 
So it could be sales driven, and it can continue to be margin driven as well as these new businesses develop, as our general merchandise business gets stronger, which helps with mix. It's all of those things. And we always talk about there's so many levers that we can pull at different times when we need to. It's also all those levers that can actually play to our advantage in any given year at any given time. So I just feel good about the momentum of the business. I'm as -- I said this to [ Gordon ] this morning. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about the business and the shape of the business model. 
To answer Q4 specifically, there's a couple of things. There's some holiday timing in international. We also had some impacts of some impairments this quarter. Some of that was adjusted out. But -- it's those things but also the costs. When you look at the supply chain costs and the COVID costs in Q4, that's big change, and we do expect some abatement of costs over the year.

I think in general, we were seeing really nice improvements in in-stock late in Q3, early Q4. We're happy with how the holiday season turned out, including the ability to deliver seasonal and hardlines across the quarter, which you saw. 
A couple of strengths that really stood out were the apparel business and our health and wellness business, were both strong throughout the quarter. Those resulted -- due to demand, those resulted in pretty decent sell-throughs. And then in January, with the effects of Omicron, we took a step back in in-store in-stock end of line. But what we're seeing right now is better flow-through all across the supply chain. You heard the increase in inventory, a large reflection of what is inbound. So we see recovery happening pretty quick. There are a couple of categories in the store that you'll see some out-of-stocks, and they're really national issues. 
And as far as the supply chain, we talked about it in Q3. There were some significant improvements in flow-through at ports, changing lead times, getting containers moved into the country and that's all helped. But just a reminder, about 2/3 of what we sell is manufactured or assembled here in the United States, and we see growth across those categories as well. So I think we'll see much better flow in the next few weeks and months and get us into a really good position as we lean into the first and second quarters."

And so maybe just can you help us understand the underlying factors that enable you to grow on this higher base?

So the business model, the income statement is just changing shape. And I think that kind of the headlines are the company is becoming more digital, it is starting to become more automated and over time, will become even more automated. And when you look at the gross margin number, we can manage it. Some of you like to watch gross margin as, I guess, makes sense quarter-to-quarter. As Brett was reminding us yesterday, you can drive yourself crazy doing that. Gross margin over time, I mean, look at our track record, we can manage gross margin. 
Now then below gross margin, we've got productivity opportunities, and technology, whether it's an app in a store for an associate on the sales floor or robotics in a distribution center, creates an opportunity for more productivity over time. That is helpful. And then you get to these other businesses like the advertising business, the last-mile delivery business, fulfillment services for eCommerce, the Marketplace itself, and these are helpful businesses from a margin point of view. And as they become a larger percent of total, the shape of the income statement changes. And our confidence in that, not only in the U.S. but around the world, in the markets we operate in, is high, and so that's why you sense that confidence from us.

Our workforce is becoming more digital. You got over 1 million associates who have a device in their hands from the minute they walk in until they leave, so that's saving them time. And then finally, I'd just reiterate what Doug mentioned, is automation and supply chain and using automation to augment the things that our associates don't want to spend as much time doing so they can spend the time on the things that are value added like in-stock and availability. 
And I will just close by saying our optimism in improvements this year is we've got a lot of room to improve in in-stock and customer ability that we've seen over the last couple of years. We're really proud of the growth. We know we could have done a lot more had we had the inventory position at the right time and the right place.

On the future of shopping, it's really exciting. I mean there are so many things that we can imagine. One of our challenges is just setting priorities and not trying to do too much. But we've got, obviously, a great strength in stores, and I think that that's clear. The pickup business has been terrific in the U.S. for many years now. Delivery is growing around the world. This delivery that's happening that's unattended is exciting. And this Walmart InHome business, which leads towards just keeping people in stock and they don't have to really think about buying the items they buy all the time and we then use that data to serve up impulse items, will be part of that future. 
We do think that social commerce around the world and what happens with wearables and AR and mixed reality will be part of our future, and we're obviously thinking about that and working on that. And this key, as I mentioned in my remarks, of stitching it together, whether it's fintech or health care -- and John, you should jump in on future of shopping, fintech and health care, too. The way you stitch that together so that one business becomes a default for the other is the magic of it. I mean if we can really become great from a financial services point of view, we can take out friction and cost for customers, make it more delightful to transact with us, even -- not even really think about transacting, John, as we've changed the shopping experience as it relates to checkouts in the future as well as on our app and in other digital forms."

It's very exciting to see some of the changes because the consumer, which historically, in the past, you might have thought of as the consumer fits in a segment, consumers really are in a segment depending on the day of the week or the hour of the day. Consumers sometimes need things right away, which we can do in under 2 hours with Express Delivery. They may need to pick up order in a couple of days and they may need something for a kid's birthday party this weekend. And we can work with all of those. And that's really exciting. 
On fintech and health care specifically, those are on our flywheel for important reasons. One, in fintech, we're excited about the potential acquisitions that we mentioned pending regulatory approval. But we're looking for modern, innovative ways to offer customers the ability to access affordable financial solutions and financial products. A considerable number of customers, including middle income customers, are underserved when it comes to financial services. And we believe that we have a role that can help there and we get it in a way that's digital. 
And then just going on to health and wellness. It's a big question with all these things that you have in there, but the health business was our fastest growing comp business in Q4. We are excited about continuing to be able to serve customers at the pharmacy. Our pharmacists and pharmacy techs have done a tremendous job this last year in serving customers. And we're seeing, with the addition of things like our telehealth company and other services, the ability for our pharmacists and tech to practice at the top of their licenses and really help customers live better. 
So you put all this together, all of these opportunities really do position the company to live its -- to its purpose. And that's to help customer's money so they can live better, and the combination of retail, financial services and health and wellness do that really well."

As I said earlier, the count of rollbacks today is up pretty significantly from the end of the third quarter and about to where it was at the end of the first quarter last year. So I'd say I was just -- I was in the store across the street early this morning, and we've got rollbacks in consumer electronics and parts of dry grocery. And those values really matter as customers become more concerned and they think more about inflationary pressures.

We think about things like opening price points and protecting for a lower-income family some of the things that they need from a staples point of view.

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sale period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss. .
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition. The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year. The third item is related to fuel costs in our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity. 
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance. As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters. We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted. We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps. 
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs. 
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter. 
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today. 
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart Go Local continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations. 
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 4 locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, -- is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities. 
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. 
We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePay recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space. 
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet Kashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, 1 finance and even and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially. 
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience, people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, e-commerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the e-commerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience, delivery accuracy and speed. 
Our e-commerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill e-commerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers. 
Moving to Sam's Club U.S., we continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw good growth in e-commerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier. 
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in e-commerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. the progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico, where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price. 
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner. 
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time. Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging periods yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation. .
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance to start the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively. 
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales stream and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically. 
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature. 
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engaged with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships. 
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth -- quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco. 
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and e-commerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID -- in various parts of the world, including China led to increased challenges. 
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables and spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving led to higher-than-normal margins for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2. 
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30. Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including: higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year. 
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores. 
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform. 
We also continue to expand our Walmart Go Local Delivery as a Service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care. 
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the One Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters. 
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. E-commerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9%, with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 11.7%, while in China, growth was slower than expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by e-commerce growth of nearly 90%. 
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also used with the strong growth of PhonePay with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher e-commerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in e-commerce across the portfolio. 
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. E-commerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage. 
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance. Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year. As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up. 
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected, during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.

The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early into March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature. So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many domain changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month or profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I pause for a second and so, we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because that was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to make yourself up. So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're attention, fuel prices are high food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they noticed even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers. ."

As far as capacity, what happened in Indianapolis was a tough event for the team to go through. Our team did a great job of keeping people safe. Everyone was out of the building in less than 5 minutes, but the building was a loss. It was a large fulfillment center in our network. The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores, and we have other fulfillment centers and went that about 72 hours. The team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There are certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly. There was some top line impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities. And as Doug said, just like our lead times are long and general merchandise or that of our suppliers and our sellers. So there's some impact there.

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sale for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bot",1684,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sale for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss. 
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.  
The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.  
The third item is related to fuel costs in our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.  
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance. As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters. 
We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted. We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.  
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.  
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.  
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.  
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.  
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of [ 40 ] locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.  
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.  
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, 1 finance in [indiscernible] and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.  
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before  adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience, people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience, delivery accuracy and speed.  
Our eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.  
Moving to Sam's Club U.S., we continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.  
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. the progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico, where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.  
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.  
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.  
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time. Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging periods yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation. .
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance to start the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.  
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.  
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.  
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engaged with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.  
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth executive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.  
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China led to increased challenges.  
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables and spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving led to higher-than-normal margins for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.  
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30. Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including: higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.  
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.  
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.  
We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.  
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.  
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9%, with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than it's expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.  
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also used with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.  
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.  
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance. Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year. As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.  
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected, during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.

But on the food side, we're seeing double-digit inflation and I'm concerned that, that inflation may continue to increase.

So when you look at our inventory numbers, part of what's driving the inventory up as we mentioned earlier, is that food is just inflated. So we'll manage in stock, we'll manage features and food and you think about the general merchandise side, break that into apparel and hardlines. Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view. And we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. 
But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season. And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong. And on the nonbasic goods that we feature. We'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks in some cases, to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely.

When things like cost of goods increase and we make decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early in the March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature. So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month or profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I pause for a second and [ huh ], we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because I was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to make yourself up.
So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're paying close attention, fuel prices are high food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they noticed even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up.

As far as capacity, what happened in Indianapolis was a tough event for the team to go through. Our team did a great job of keeping people safe. Everyone was out of the building in less than 5 minutes, but the building was a loss. It was a large fulfillment center in our network. The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores, and we have other fulfillment centers and went that about 72 hours. The team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There are certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly. 
There was some top line impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities. And as Doug said, just like our hourly times are long and general merchandise or that of our suppliers and our sellers. So there's some impact there. But looking at the business most recently, as we talked about with Walmart Connect and other parts of commerce, now that we're into the second quarter, early signs of May are given some of the increases in temperature, the seasonal categories have really taken off and that would include Walmart.com and our eCommerce business."

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sales for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss.
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.
The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.
The third item is related to fuel costs and our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance.
As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters.
We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted.
We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise, is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 40 locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com, is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app, which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, ONE Finance and Even, and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience and delivery accuracy and speed.
Our eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.
Moving to Sam's Club U.S. We continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw a good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. The progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time.
Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging period yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation.
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance at start of the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock, and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engage with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth executive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China, led to increased challenges.
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables as spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather, such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving, led to higher-than-normal markdowns for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30.
Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.
We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9% with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers, such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance.
Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year.
As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.
Now we'd be happy to open up the call for your questions."

As far as the inventory positioning the growth in the U.S., specifically about 33%.

And then as I said, there is a portion of the inventory that we'll need in the next quarter or 2 to work through. Customers responding very well to the rollbacks.

We're happier with our inventory levels versus where we have been in previous quarters. And then with warmer weather, we've seen a reaction from the consumer in the grocery categories.
In terms of the rollbacks, specifically, we position those over 10,000 rollbacks in seasonal and general merchandise categories. I mentioned earlier the inventory level up 33%, about more than half of that -- the majority of that is not only inflation but it is improvement in availability across the entire network. And then there's a portion of the inventory that the rollbacks and other things that we have in place already will help us sail through over the next couple of quarters."

And then on the entire flywheel, Plus is an important piece of the flywheel. When you look at the flywheel and step back, we have the business at stores.

But on the food side, we're seeing double-digit inflation, and I'm concerned that that inflation may continue to increase. And then on the GM side, we may see that turn faster during the course of the year. So when you look at our inventory numbers, part of what's driving the inventory up as we mentioned earlier is that food is just inflated. So we'll manage in-stock, we'll manage features and food and you think about the general merchandise side, break that into apparel and hardlines.
Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view. And we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season.
And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong and on the nonbasic goods that we feature. We'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks in some cases to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely. We'll not only watch kind of the opening price point and pack size change on the food side for some customers, the move to private brands, but we'll also watch what that means for the general merchandise side of the business."

When things like cost of goods increase and we make decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early in the March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature.
So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month and profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I paused for a second, and then [ huh ], we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because I was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to mix yourself up.
So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're paying close attention, fuel prices are high, food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they notice even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers."

I wish we'd gone out on a great quarter, and [ you're still really ] due in that way. So you can chime in from the cheap seats when things get better.
Speaking of things getting better, we're motivated to have a really strong year. I mean we are understanding the environment, trying to convey to you all what we see going forward. But we expect customers and members to come our way. We're going to keep growing overall. We're going to keep growing our share, and we're going to change the business model of the company to be more profitable. And there were some things that happened during the quarter that were different than what we expected, and we're trying to be very transparent about those things. And then with performance, earn your trust and just keep moving forward and make this as isolated of an issue as we can.
There is a lot of uncertainty looking forward. Things are very fluid. I know you all are gathering information every day and so are we. And as I talk to people across the country and across the world, there seems to be more uncertainty now in a very fluid environment. And so we'll just -- we'll deal with that. And we like the hand that we've got to play. We've got a great set of assets. We've got a great set of people. And when things are more difficult, we should outperform. So our first quarter performance is a disappointment to us, and we're going to put it behind us and have a strong year.
Looking forward to seeing you in person, those of you that can make it to the meeting on June 3, we'll be down in Fayetteville, and we're going to have a bunch of associates and kind of get back to pre-pandemic type week which we're all excited about, and we hope to see you there. Thank you all."

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sales for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss.
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.
The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.
The third item is related to fuel costs and our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance.
As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters.
We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted.
We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise, is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 40 locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com, is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app, which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, ONE Finance and Even, and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience and delivery accuracy and speed.
Our eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.
Moving to Sam's Club U.S. We continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw a good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. The progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time.
Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging period yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation.
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance at start of the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock, and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engage with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth executive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China, led to increased challenges.
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables as spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather, such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving, led to higher-than-normal markdowns for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30.
Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.
We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9% with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers, such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance.
Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year.
As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.

Of course, there was inflation that came through the quarter in terms of cost of goods, then there was the fuel cost charges that we mentioned that came in at very fast rate, really late February, early March. And then there was the pressure on wages that was really in the month of February after the Omicron environment. And for the most part, I feel good about the way we have those costs positioned for now. Of course, it could change given that how dynamic the market is.
And then on the entire flywheel, Plus is an important piece of the flywheel. When you look at the flywheel and step back, we have the business at stores. We have our eCommerce business, including marketplace. We're making progress in health care and financial services with the acquisitions that we managed to complete and have under the one banner. And then Plus along with Walmart Connect and data ventures are all important pieces of the flywheel. Really pleased with the progress the team has made in terms of growing the pickup business and offering more slots for customers, becoming more flexible, and our NPS scores are improving in those categories. It's great to see the team make the progress they've made."

But on the food side, we're seeing double-digit inflation, and I'm concerned that that inflation may continue to increase. And then on the GM side, we may see that turn faster during the course of the year. So when you look at our inventory numbers, part of what's driving the inventory up as we mentioned earlier is that food is just inflated. So we'll manage in-stock, we'll manage features and food and you think about the general merchandise side, break that into apparel and hardlines.
Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view. And we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season.
And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong and on the nonbasic goods that we feature. We'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks in some cases to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely. We'll not only watch kind of the opening price point and pack size change on the food side for some customers, the move to private brands, but we'll also watch what that means for the general merchandise side of the business."

When things like cost of goods increase and we make decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early in the March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature.
So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month and profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I paused for a second, and then [ huh ], we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because I was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to mix yourself up.
So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're paying close attention, fuel prices are high, food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they notice even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers."

The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores, and we have other fulfillment centers, and with that, in about 72 hours, the team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There were certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly.
There was some top line impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities.

He's been a great partner, not just to me but to all of the us. His judgment, his character, his knowledge of the company, just who he is as a person. It's a great accomplishment to become the CFO of Walmart and you've done a great job, and we're going to miss you. I wish we'd gone out on a great quarter, and [ you're still really ] due in that way. So you can chime in from the cheap seats when things get better.
Speaking of things getting better, we're motivated to have a really strong year. I mean we are understanding the environment, trying to convey to you all what we see going forward. But we expect customers and members to come our way. We're going to keep growing overall. We're going to keep growing our share, and we're going to change the business model of the company to be more profitable. And there were some things that happened during the quarter that were different than what we expected, and we're trying to be very transparent about those things. And then with performance, earn your trust and just keep moving forward and make this as isolated of an issue as we can.
There is a lot of uncertainty looking forward. Things are very fluid. I know you all are gathering information every day and so are we. And as I talk to people across the country and across the world, there seems to be more uncertainty now in a very fluid environment. And so we'll just -- we'll deal with that. And we like the hand that we've got to play. We've got a great set of assets. We've got a great set of people. And when things are more difficult, we should outperform. So our first quarter performance is a disappointment to us, and we're going to put it behind us and have a strong year.
Looking forward to seeing you in person, those of you that can make it to the meeting on June 3, we'll be down in Fayetteville, and we're going to have a bunch of associates and kind of get back to pre-pandemic type week which we're all excited about, and we hope to see you there. Thank you all."

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sales for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss.
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.
The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.
The third item is related to fuel costs and our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance.
As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters.
We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted.
We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise, is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 40 locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com, is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app, which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, ONE Finance and Even, and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience and delivery accuracy and speed.
Our eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.
Moving to Sam's Club U.S. We continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw a good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. The progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time.
Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging period yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation.
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance at start of the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will stretch some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock, and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engage with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China, led to increased challenges.
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables as spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather, such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving, led to higher-than-normal markdowns for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30.
Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.
We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9% with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers, such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance.
Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year.
As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.
Now we'd be happy to open up the call for your questions."

Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view. And we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season.
And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong and on the nonbasic goods that we feature. We'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks in some cases to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely. We'll not only watch kind of the opening price point and pack size change on the food side for some customers, the move to private brands, but we'll also watch what that means for the general merchandise side of the business."

The store is excited about the rollbacks and the customers are responding. The execution has been strong. And as Doug mentioned, with food inflation, with the growth we've seen in the first quarter, I'm also concerned about the rate at which prices have risen in the country, and our team, our supply base, we need to do more to keep costs low. And where we see the switching from brands to private brands, we'll continue to watch that for a group of customers, but we've got to all work harder to keep prices low for the American consumer."

When things like cost of goods increase and we make decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early in the March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature.
So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month and profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I paused for a second, and then [ huh ], we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because I was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to mix yourself up.
So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're paying close attention, fuel prices are high, food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they notice even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers."

As far as capacity, what happened in Indianapolis was a tough event for the team to go through. Our team did a great job of keeping people safe. Everyone was out of the building in less than 5 minutes, but the building was a loss. It was a large fulfillment center in our network. The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores, and we have other fulfillment centers, and with that, in about 72 hours, the team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There were certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly.
There was some top line impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities. And as Doug said, just like our hourly times are long and general merchandise or that of our suppliers and our sellers. So there's some impact there.

Speaking of things getting better, we're motivated to have a really strong year. I mean we are understanding the environment, trying to convey to you all what we see going forward. But we expect customers and members to come our way. We're going to keep growing overall. We're going to keep growing our share, and we're going to change the business model of the company to be more profitable. And there were some things that happened during the quarter that were different than what we expected, and we're trying to be very transparent about those things. And then with performance, earn your trust and just keep moving forward and make this as isolated of an issue as we can.
There is a lot of uncertainty looking forward. Things are very fluid. I know you all are gathering information every day and so are we.

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sales for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss.
The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.
The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.
The third item is related to fuel costs and our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.
As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance.
As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters.
We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted.
We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.
While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise, is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.
Importantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.
We're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.
Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.
Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 40 locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com, is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app, which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.
And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.
I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, ONE Finance and Even, and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.
Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience and delivery accuracy and speed.
Our eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.
Moving to Sam's Club U.S. We continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw a good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.
Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. The progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.
In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.
Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.
With that, I give you Mr. Biggs."

In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time.
Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging period yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation.
There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance at start of the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.
The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will stretch some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock, and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.
Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.
Our expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engage with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.
Now let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.
First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China, led to increased challenges.
While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables as spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather, such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving, led to higher-than-normal markdowns for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.
SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30.
Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.
We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.
We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.
One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.
International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9% with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.
Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers, such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance.
Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year.
As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.
In closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.
Now we'd be happy to open up the call for your questions."

So on the basket, in the first quarter, we definitely had an impact due to the offsetting of stimulus from last year. We had a very strong quarter last year, one of the strongest quarters we've ever had. So expected an impact in general merchandise as we went into the quarter. And we did see increased strengthening in food as the quarter went along and then late in the quarter and then to the beginning of the month of May, we've seen strengthening in general merchandise. I think it's a combination of warmer weather across the country and the response to the rollbacks that we put in place.
In terms of the consumer themselves, we've seen strong growth with higher income consumers, middle income and lower income, but we do see a definite strength with high-ticket items, as I said, with some consumers and in others, we do see some switching, which would include switching specifically from brands to private brands."

We had significant strength in categories that were affected by stimulus.
As far as the inventory positioning the growth in the U.S., specifically about 33%. As I said earlier, the vast majority of that is inflation plus the improvements in availability that we have prepared for and intentionally purchase over the last few quarters. And then as I said, there is a portion of the inventory that we'll need in the next quarter or 2 to work through. Customers responding very well to the rollbacks. We began those late in apparel in the third -- or the first quarter and then extended more rollbacks into the second, and we're seeing a good response from both of those.

So we'll manage in-stock, we'll manage features and food and you think about the general merchandise side, break that into apparel and hardlines.
Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view. And we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season.
And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong and on the nonbasic goods that we feature. We'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks in some cases to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely. We'll not only watch kind of the opening price point and pack size change on the food side for some customers, the move to private brands, but we'll also watch what that means for the general merchandise side of the business."

When things like cost of goods increase and we make decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early in the March, those kinds of things, along with -- we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature.
So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends."

And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area talk to us is quite a long time ago about profit for the month and profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so we asked the buyers, I was one of them to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I paused for a second, and then [ huh ], we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because I was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above average margins, bring those prices down to mix yourself up.
So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're paying close attention, fuel prices are high, food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they notice even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers."

As far as capacity, what happened in Indianapolis was a tough event for the team to go through. Our team did a great job of keeping people safe. Everyone was out of the building in less than 5 minutes, but the building was a loss. It was a large fulfillment center in our network. The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores, and we have other fulfillment centers, and with that, in about 72 hours, the team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There were certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly.
There was some top line impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities. And as Doug said, just like our hourly times are long and general merchandise or that of our suppliers and our sellers. So there's some impact there.

And there were some things that happened during the quarter that were different than what we expected, and we're trying to be very transparent about those things. And then with performance, earn your trust and just keep moving forward and make this as isolated of an issue as we can.

A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year. The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated, and John David will touch on that in a moment and",1465,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year. 
The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated, and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year. Our sales were well ahead of plan with inflation lifting our average transaction size, but we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families. 
From the U.S. to Mexico to Canada to Chile, they're prioritizing how they spend their money. We're pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people money and help them live better, and that's especially important right now. 
After the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables and excess inventory in general merchandise categories were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continued to tick up, and we continue to see a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables in many of our markets, and that put pressure on margins overall. 
Food comps in the U.S. were up mid-teens for the quarter with units in food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation. Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we've taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories, and we have. We've made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we focused and taken markdowns. The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel in particular put financial pressure on us, but it helped relieve pressure on our stores and through our supply chain. 
We're making good progress to reduce costs. We've reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We're also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs. The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be. 
We had our U.S. store manager meeting last week and amongst other topics, we shared examples of items where we're holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food and consumables items. We want to help families put meals on the table with great value in our other private brands to relieve the pressure they're feeling. The quality, value and convenience we offer makes Walmart a smart choice, and we're seeing more middle and higher income shoppers choose us. 
As I've been in U.S. stores recently, I'm pleased how we've executed back to school. As we finish it off in some markets, we've transitioned back to college in the appropriate stores with items like mini refrigerators, floor-length mirrors and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India. After visits to Flipkart, Mantra and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center and a corona to see how they're using PhonePe, I left even more excited about what's happening in these businesses and what's to come. 
Having visited several of our international markets this year, I'm pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we're building is common across markets as we scale marketplace businesses and fulfillment advertising and financial services and take steps to make a bigger difference in health care. 
As I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to the back-to-school season, and we'll quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There's a lot of newness, and we've got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas to Flipkart's big billion days, we'll be ready. We'll have a cleaner inventory position and will have a strong seasonal presence. We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make, and we're adjusting to that reality so we can help them more. 
Regardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We're becoming more digital, even more relevant as an omnichannel retailer, and the related businesses, like fulfillment and advertising, continue to grow. We're building a different business, and we're making progress. 
Let's move on to our operating segments. I'll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains. Pickup and delivery are strong. Growth is improving on Walmart.com, including the marketplace. And more people are choosing to be a Walmart Plus member, or step up to in-home. 
Walmart+ is an important component of our plan, and we announced the addition of a streaming benefit. Walmart+ members will receive a Paramount Plus subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart+ membership in September. The premium streaming service offers a broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows and live sports. We're excited about the coming launch, and we know our members will be, too. 
Beyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores. We've increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it's how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white label delivery platform service, Walmart Go Local, will celebrate its 1-year anniversary later this month. Powered by our Spark driver platform, I'm excited about the growth I've seen so far and the expectations looking ahead. We passed 1 million deliveries so far with Go Local. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year-end and client satisfaction scores are strong. We continue to sign up larger scale customers, and we're making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small and medium-sized businesses. 
Our technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow while contributing to our operating margins over time. Advertising is also performing well. In Walmart U.S., the Walmart Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us. 
Improvements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers, both year-over-year and sequentially. We've seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increased 121% over last year. Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them. 
As you've heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S., like India and Mexico. 
Turning to Sam's Club in the U.S. Comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10%. And marking the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher-than-normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We'll continue to make progress as we move through Q3, and we'll be in good shape as we enter the holiday season. 
We like what we see in terms of membership. Total accounts are up about 9% over last year, and the penetration of Plus members continues to climb. 
Moving on to Walmart International, where we performed well again in Q2 with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the 3 largest markets of Mexico, Canada and China. We're also accelerating our digital businesses, including strong e-commerce growth over the last 2 years. Mexico is up 31%; Canada, 32%. And China 152%. 
We see this growth even as customers choose to do more in-person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels. Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through in how people are shopping. In Mexico, we saw all formats perform well, and Bodega was especially strong with comps above the overall Walmex average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2, and we're seeing more customers shopping this format. 
While inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I'm proud that we're helping families access the things they need at more affordable prices. I'll close today by thanking our associates for all they do every day to support our customers and members. I'd also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to him."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We're moving a lot of volume through our business, and I'm proud of how our associate team has responded and serving customers as we manage through this unique period. 
We delivered strong top line growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter. Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures. 
As we navigate the current environment, we know that we're not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We're facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related to excess inventory, fuel prices and supply chain. But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the year has progressed, we've seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade down activity. 
As an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hotdogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflected higher. And in food category, specifically the private brand growth rate doubled compared to Q1 levels. We'll continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably. 
We've been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieved expense leverage across all 3 segments in Q2, even though we haven't fully lapped the wage investments implemented last year. During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect certain supply chain costs and inflation and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers. 
We're encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition costs. We've taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost, too, and we're achieving significant savings in procurement of goods not for resale. 
In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we've seen labor productivity metrics improve. We're finding efficiencies and reducing expenses while still focusing on operational excellence. I want to spend a moment discussing inventory. 
As a backdrop, the shifts that we've seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic, shifting from in-store to online, along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services. and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms have been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise. 
The result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter. Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels and content and have made a lot of progress during the last quarter. In-stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we're experiencing. 
We also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories. At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. 
General merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with more work to do. We've cleared most summer seasonal inventory, but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and sporting goods. 
We've also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels, and our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute levels and mix, which will enable our stores to be well positioned ahead of the holiday season. 
Despite the short-term challenges we're facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income streams. For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2, led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart, as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers. 
We now have over 240 million items in our U.S. e-commerce assortment, and our marketplace seller count has increased about 60% year-over-year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow. 
We're also excited about the build-out of automation and technology throughout our business and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I've been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution and fulfillment centers and witness the supply chain automation and technology that we're putting in our stores and centers. 
One example is the VizPick technology that we've rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores. This tool uses augmented reality to speed the inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the back room to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time, but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out of stocks. It's a win-win. 
In summary, our business is resilient. And with the omni capabilities we've built, we're better positioned now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now let's get to some additional Q2 financial details. 
As mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales at a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada and China, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered comps of 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco. 
Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S. businesses. Sam's Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points, helped by higher sales, partially offset by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year. 
Operating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.77. Two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments. Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion, reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments. 
During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023. 
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a 2-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth while general merchandise sales were soft, particularly in electronics, apparel and home. 
Transactions increased 1%, while average ticket increased 5.5%. We were pleased to see e-commerce sales growth improve sequentially, up 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 18% on a 2-year stack. SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by the wage investments. 
The team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure, so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat. Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%. International had another really good quarter. Sales were strong, up 9.9% in constant currency. 
Currency headwinds negatively affected reported sales results by about $1 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales with Mexico and China leading the way. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11% with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales, which grew 18%. The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning as customers manage through this inflationary period. 
In China, comp sales were up more than 14% with strong growth in e-commerce sales, which increased 77% in the quarter and more than 150% on a 2-year stack. E-commerce penetration continues to climb in both our Sam's Clubs and hypermarket stores as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs. 
Canada comp sales increased more than 10% even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and the team is gearing up for big billion days. I traveled to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth. 
PhonePe continued to see strong growth with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about $3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance recovery for prior operational disruptions in Chile. 
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%. E-commerce sales grew 25%, with strong contributions from both curbside and ship to home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9% with another record high quarter in overall member counts and continued growth in Plus member penetration. 
Sam's added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns.  expenses 131 basis points, including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs. But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain and fulfillment cost and a 70 basis point inflation-related LIFO charge pressured profitability. 
As a result, operating income declined about 35%. Now let's turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability. Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail. 
When we provided guidance 3 months ago, we didn't expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double digits year-over-year, and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step-up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1. The rising cost for essential items and customers' reprioritization of spending led to significant mix shifts in our business. Grocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points, whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted in additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry. 
Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense. We finished the quarter on a strong note, however, and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month, and the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start. Contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month with good flow-through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost. 
We're taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year, and we built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance. Our sales and profit view reflects trends we've seen year-to-date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters. 
We've updated our fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance. 
For Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S. We're expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year '23, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S. 
We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures, this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5% and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%. 
Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart and meeting many of you for the first time. I'm excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn't detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better. We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need. 
This mission permeates our culture in everything that we do. I've joined an exceptional leadership team. Their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of. And you combine that with the resources we have and the investments we're making in things like supply chain automation, improving our e-commerce capabilities and diversifying our portfolio with higher-margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earnings streams as they scale. 
We have the potential to not only be relevant in the next chapter of retail, but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days of Walmart are in front of us. I look forward to working with you, and now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you."

We view Q2 as being most urgent to clear through the apparel and some are seasonal that we needed out of the way and sold before Q3 really began to arrive. 
We certainly made progress in apparel. There's more work to be done in inventory in general with a 25% increase and about 40% of that inflation, then the remaining, there's 2 things. One, it helps us in terms of in-stock, we were out of stock last year all throughout the year. So we have made improvements on in stock.

And what we want to do and what we try to do throughout this entire period is go up as late as possible. We certainly have been passing prices through when we see things like landed cost of goods going up, those have to be passed through. 
We're managing our supply costs as well as we can. Units did strengthen throughout the quarter, particularly in July and late July. I think you heard that earlier. So seeing some positive units there was refreshing given how we had started the quarter. 
Fuel prices were coming down. So we think that could have had some of an impact as well. In terms of the market, we're really focused on everyday low price. We have a strong rollback campaign all across the store, which would include food, consumables and general merchandise. And then in general, just across the food categories, our availability improvements, I think you can see in stores more consistently and across categories. Just you remember this time last year, we had pockets about of stocks that kept emerging the only 1 that we really faced in the second quarter in a big way was baby formula, which is now improving."

And so just to tag on to Doug's comments, serving customers in store is something we have pressed ourselves on a long time. Our pickup business continues. Delivery is growing with Walmart. So the variety of ways that we can serve customers, I think it's been helpful, especially given the number of ships customers that have had in their lives the last couple of years from working at home and then in many cases, back out into the workplace. 
So as customers change, we can serve them in a number of ways. When you then click into products, our wide portfolio of products, both in e-commerce and in stores, including the numbers you heard from John David earlier in Marketplace, gives us the ability to serve a wide range of customers. 
And then as Doug mentioned last week, we had all of our managers together in Denver, which is always a fun exciting experience to get the team together. But what I heard consistently is as the team is doing a very nice job balancing out how to improve quality and sell higher price points and remaining focused on opening price points. 
So having Thanksgiving meals in a position where you can buy an entire meal for under $50 for a family of 4 is exciting. So there's a value play, and there's a quality play. And wherever the customer goes and how things shifts, we'll be ready to serve them and we're building the capabilities to be able to do that at will."

And that was the issue that throughout Q2, we spent the most time worrying about because we need to move through it because the goods have been purchased a long way out. 
Regarding the rest, in Q1 and then in Q2, as the backlog of containers work itself through, that has created a lot of what the issue is today, where we felt good that we would have liked to have had months ago, and then this season is all here at the same time. So we've ingested all that inventory. 
We've largely gotten out of the container storage and movement business. We have the inventory in the network. So we have a good handle on what we own, where it is.

So the absolute spend that an American family is deploying the fuel is still high [indiscernible] is the amount of food inflation. And I think Q4 last year is the moment where we started to see U.S. food inflation tick up. It was kind of low to mid-single digits. 
So when you get to Q4, you start to anniversary a food inflation number against a food inflation number. So the 2-year stack of food inflation will be something that we'll be keeping an eye on. If you told us that fuel was going to continue to tick down and that food inflation was going to moderate, that influences how we think about general merchandise inventory. 
And as we worked with the merchants over the last few weeks, it's been kind of fascinating to think through how you make choices on it and category by category because you don't want to go into too much of a defensive mode, and we were looking at Halloween decor last week, John, and there are some things, outdoor decor, particularly like inflatables, that are really fun, cool, new items. 
And when you see them, you're like, we can sell. Oh, you can buy that. Like we're going to blow out of some of those. And we want the buyers in some categories to have that mentality and be aggressive. In other places, we want to be more conservative so that we don't repeat the mistakes that we've had in the first half of this year. 
That's such an interesting thing to work through. It takes a lot more leadership from our merchant team, for example, that it might ordinarily, we think we have made some good decisions subcategory by subcategory for the back half of this year, canceled some orders, trying to get that right area by area so that we don't end up being too conservative in places where we shouldn't be."

And a quick second for Kath is just the home and apparel comps were much stronger at CMs. Was that all clearance? Or is there something different between Sam's and Walmart U.S. in terms of home apparel sales?"

In relation to -- as it relates to food inflation, it definitely moved up in the second quarter and moved up in the months of the second quarter. So July was higher than June. June was higher than May. 
I think it's too early into the third quarter to try to make a call if this is where we'll be, if it will go higher or go down. So for now, we're assuming that this is the level we're at and it could continue. And some of the factors though to consider is one of the costs that are part of the way we price food is the cost of moving food. So diesel fuel and fuel continue to move down, that could be a tailwind related to inflation. 
However, there's still some commodities up. We do see a few categories in the store where prices are starting to come down, but there are other categories where we're still rising. So I think it's just too early to call in the quarter. Certainly hope that some of these larger macroeconomic conditions would lead to lower prices in food, but we're not able to say that we see that happening just yet."

Last year and the year before, there weren't really many markdowns to speak of because we were chasing demand and in many cases, at the end of the seasons were very clean. 
So returning to a point where there are in the season markdowns is a pretty normal thing that we would experience. And the way we're trying to manage the sell-through season by season as compared to historical rates back in 2018, 2019. And of course, things are always going to be different, but it's a gibrometer that determine where we land. 
The second the business is much larger than it was in 2019. So these volume levels continue to improve, which then leads to the dynamic of how much you purchase, which ultimately amount you purchase versus demand will lead you to your sell-through and markdown numbers. 
So for the fourth quarter, we mentioned we've canceled billions in orders. We feel much better about the back half of the year. We still have inventory to work through and ingest from the backlogs, as we said. So we need a couple of quarters to do that. 
And then heading into the next year, we'll have purchasing levels that are more in line with the way we see demand as it's going today. Of course, a lot can change. We need to know more about fuel pricing and inflation in the state of the consumers we get there, but we have definitely had more time and more success in getting purchasing in line with our current inventory levels and the way we see demand going in terms of mix today."

First, let me just say a big thank you to our supply chain team, our merchants. They have been through a lot. The environment has been extremely dynamic, and they have really just made a huge difference for the entire company. 
In the last couple of quarters, what's it been like. There was the backlog of containers that really started last fall when the ports backed up. We've worked those through. In terms of container costs, they are down from where they were, but they are still higher than they were a year ago and the year ago was higher than it's higher than they were the year before that. 
So still inflated, and those costs are flowing through. Fuel costing, as Doug said earlier, fuel has come down from its peak at the end of Q1, early Q2, but it still remains elevated. And those are real costs that are passed through and customers will see those prices at the counter and on the site. 
So in general, we see better flow. We see better availability. Our availability rates in food, consumables and then our consumable portions of general merchandise are much better than they were a year ago. But I still think we have work to do to get back to where we were back in 2019, but still uneven in places. 
And any time in retail, that inventories back up the way they did. It does cause pressure on being able to get the right inventory at the right location in front of the customer. So optimistic that can improve as these inventories come down, but it's going to take a few more months to work through the backlog of the inventory that's in the network."

A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year.

A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year.  
The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated, and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year. Our sales were well ahead of plan, with inflation lifting our average transaction size, but we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families.  
From the U.S. to Mexico to Canada to Chile, they're prioritizing how they spend their money. We're pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people money and help them live better, and that's especially important right now.  
After the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables and excess inventory in general merchandise categories, were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continued to tick up, and we continue to see a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables in many of our markets, and that put pressure on margins overall.  
Food comps in the U.S. were up mid-teens for the quarter, with units in food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation. Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we've taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories, and we have. We've made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we focused and taken markdowns. The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel, in particular, put financial pressure on us, but it helped relieve pressure on our stores and through our supply chain.  
We're making good progress to reduce costs. We've reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We're also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs. The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be.  
We had our U.S. store manager meeting last week. And amongst other topics, we shared examples of items where we're holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food and consumables items. We want to help families put meals on the table with great value in our other private brands to relieve the pressure they're feeling. The quality, value and convenience we offer makes Walmart a smart choice, and we're seeing more middle- and higher-income shoppers choose us.  
As I've been in U.S. stores recently, I'm pleased how we've executed back-to-school. As we finish it off in some markets, we've transitioned back-to-college in the appropriate stores with items like mini refrigerators, floor-length mirrors and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India. After visits to Flipkart, Myntra and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center and a kirana to see how they're using PhonePe, I left even more excited about what's happening in these businesses and what's to come.  
Having visited several of our international markets this year, I'm pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we're building is common across markets as we scale Marketplace businesses and fulfillment, advertising and financial services and take steps to make a bigger difference in health care.  
As I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to the back-to-school season, and we'll quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There's a lot of newness, and we've got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas to Flipkart's Big Billion Days, we'll be ready. We'll have a cleaner inventory position and we'll have a strong seasonal presence. We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make, and we're adjusting to that reality so we can help them more.  
Regardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We're becoming more digital, even more relevant as an omnichannel retailer; and the related businesses, like fulfillment and advertising, continue to grow. We're building a different business, and we're making progress.  
Let's move on to our operating segments. I'll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains. Pickup and delivery are strong. Growth is improving on Walmart.com, including the Marketplace, and more people are choosing to be a Walmart+ member or step up to InHome.  
Walmart+ is an important component of our plan, and we announced the addition of a streaming benefit. Walmart+ members will receive a Paramount+ subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart+ membership in September. The premium streaming service offers a broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows and live sports. We're excited about the coming launch, and we know our members will be, too.  
Beyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores. We've increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it's how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white-label delivery platform service, Walmart GoLocal, will celebrate its 1-year anniversary later this month. Powered by our Spark Driver platform, I'm excited about the growth I've seen so far and the expectations looking ahead. We passed 1 million deliveries so far with GoLocal. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year-end and client satisfaction scores are strong. We continue to sign up larger scale customers, and we're making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small- and medium-sized businesses.  
Our technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow while contributing to our operating margins over time. Advertising is also performing well. In Walmart U.S., the Walmart Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us.  
Improvements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers, both year-over-year and sequentially. We've seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increased 121% over last year. Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them.  As you've heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S., like India and Mexico.  
Turning to Sam's Club in the U.S. Comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10%, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher-than-normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We'll continue to make progress as we move through Q3, and we'll be in good shape as we enter the holiday season.  We like what we see in terms of membership. Total accounts are up about 9% over last year, and the penetration of Plus members continues to climb.  
Moving on to Walmart International, where we performed well again in Q2, with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the 3 largest markets of Mexico, Canada and China. We're also accelerating our digital businesses, including strong eCommerce growth over the last 2 years. Mexico is up 31%; Canada, 32%; and China, 152%.  
We see this growth even as customers choose to do more in-person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels. Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through in how people are shopping. In Mexico, we saw all formats perform well, and Bodega was especially strong with comps above the overall Walmex average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2, and we're seeing more customers shopping this format.  
While inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I'm proud that we're helping families access the things they need at more affordable prices. I'll close today by thanking our associates for all they do every day to support our customers and members. I'd also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to him."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We're moving a lot of volume through our business, and I'm proud of how our associate team has responded in serving customers as we manage through this unique period.  
We delivered strong top line growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter. Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures.  
As we navigate the current environment, we know that we're not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We're facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related to excess inventory, fuel prices and supply chain. But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the year has progressed, we've seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade-down activity.  
As an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflected higher. And in food category, specifically the private brand growth rate doubled compared to Q1 levels. We'll continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably.  
We've been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieved expense leverage across all 3 segments in Q2, even though we haven't fully lapped the wage investments implemented last year. During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect certain supply chain costs and inflation and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers.  
We're encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition costs. We've taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost, too, and we're achieving significant savings in procurement of goods not for resale.  In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we've seen labor productivity metrics improve. We're finding efficiencies and reducing expenses while still focusing on operational excellence. 
I want to spend a moment discussing inventory.  As a backdrop, the shifts that we've seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic, shifting from in-store to online, along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms, have been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise.  
The result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter. Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels and content and have made a lot of progress during the last quarter. In-stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we're experiencing.  
We also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories. At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation.  
General merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with more work to do. We've cleared most summer seasonal inventory, but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and sporting goods.  
We've also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels, and our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute levels and mix, which will enable our stores to be well positioned ahead of the holiday season.  
Despite the short-term challenges we're facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income streams. For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2, led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart, as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers.  
We now have over 240 million items in our U.S. eCommerce assortment, and our Marketplace seller count has increased about 60% year-over-year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow.  
We're also excited about the build-out of automation and technology throughout our business and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I've been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution and fulfillment centers and witness the supply chain automation and technology that we're putting in our stores and centers.  One example is the VizPick technology that we've rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores. This tool uses augmented reality to speed the inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the backroom to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time, but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out-of-stocks. It's a win-win.  
In summary, our business is resilient. And with the omni capabilities we've built, we're better positioned now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now let's get to some additional Q2 financial details.  
As mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales at a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada and China, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered comps of 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco.  Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S. businesses. Sam's Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points, helped by higher sales, partially offset by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year.  
Operating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.77. Two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments. Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion, reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments. 
During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023.  
Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued, with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a 2-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth while general merchandise sales were soft, particularly in electronics, apparel and home.  
Transactions increased 1%, while average ticket increased 5.5%. We were pleased to see eCommerce sales growth improve sequentially, up 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 18% on a 2-year stack. SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by the wage investments.  
The team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure, so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat. Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%. International had another really good quarter. Sales were strong, up 9.9% in constant currency.  
Currency headwinds negatively affected reported sales results by about $1 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, with Mexico and China leading the way. eCommerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11%, with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew 18%. The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning, as customers manage through this inflationary period.  
In China, comp sales were up more than 14%, with strong growth in eCommerce sales, which increased 77% in the quarter and more than 150% on a 2-year stack. eCommerce penetration continues to climb in both our Sam's Clubs and hypermarket stores, as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs.  
Canada comp sales increased more than 10%, even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and the team is gearing up for Big Billion Days. I traveled to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth.  
PhonePe continued to see strong growth with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about 3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance recovery for prior operational disruptions in Chile.  
Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%. eCommerce sales grew 25%, with strong contributions from both curbside and ship-to-home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9%, with another record high quarter in overall member counts and continued growth in Plus member penetration.  
Sam's added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns. Sam's leveraged expenses 131 basis points, including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs. But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain and fulfillment cost and a 70 basis point inflation-related LIFO charge pressured profitability.  As a result, operating income declined about 35%. 
Now let's turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability. Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail.  When we provided guidance 3 months ago, we didn't expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double digits year-over-year, and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step-up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1. The rising cost for essential items and customers' reprioritization of spending led to significant mix shifts in our business. 
Grocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points, whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted in additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry. Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense. We finished the quarter on a strong note, however, and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month, and the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start. Contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month, with good flow-through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost.  
We're taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year, and we built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance. Our sales and profit view reflects trends we've seen year-to-date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters.  
We've updated our fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance.  
For Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S. We're expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year '23, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S.  We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures, this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5% and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%.  
Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart in meeting many of you for the first time. I'm excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn't detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better. We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need.  
This mission permeates our culture in everything that we do. I've joined an exceptional leadership team. Their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of. And you combine that with the resources we have and the investments we're making in things like supply chain automation, improving our eCommerce capabilities and diversifying our portfolio with higher-margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earnings streams as they scale.  
We have the potential to not only be relevant in the next chapter of retail but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days of Walmart are in front of us. 
I look forward to working with you, and now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you."

Halloween looks fantastic, back-to-school, back-to-college has been good. Tailgating has been great. 
I think what I would say is in our number in this quarter, a portion of it has been markdowns and a portion of it is actually an inventory reserve because we wanted to get in front of it and just make sure that we put aside the money for Q3 so that we can have a really strong Q3 kind of results. So that's how we've addressed markdowns in Q2."

That leaves about 25% of it, which is some GM categories in a couple of markets, specifically, which would be Chile and Canada. But I'm very comfortable with the way that the market have dealt with that. And just as a reminder, for at least Chile, our quarter end is a month earlier than the enterprise quarter end.

And what we want to do and what we try to do throughout this entire period is go up as late as possible. We certainly have been passing prices through when we see things like landed cost of goods going up, those have to be passed through. 
We're managing our supply costs as well as we can. Units did strengthen throughout the quarter, particularly in July, of late July. I think you heard that earlier. So seeing some positive units there was refreshing given how we had started the quarter. 
Fuel prices were coming down. So we think that could have had some of an impact as well. In terms of the market, we're really focused on everyday low price. We have a strong rollback campaign all across the store, which would include food, consumables and general merchandise. And then in general, just across the food categories, our availability improvements, I think you can see in stores more consistently and across categories. Just if you remember this time last year, we had pockets of out-of-stocks that kept emerging. That's the only one that we really faced.

And so just to tag on to Doug's comments, serving customers in store is something we have pressed ourselves on a long time. Our pickup business continues to grow. Delivery is growing with Walmart+. So the variety of ways that we can serve customers, I think it's been helpful, especially given the number of shifts customers have had in their lives the last couple of years from working at home and then, in many cases, back out into the workplace. 
So as customers change, we can serve them in a number of ways. When you then click into products, our wide portfolio of products, both in eCommerce and in stores, including the numbers you heard from John David earlier in Marketplace, gives us the ability to serve a wide range of customers. 
And then as Doug mentioned last week, we had all of our managers together in Denver, which is always a fun, exciting experience to get the team together. But what I heard consistently is as the team is doing a very nice job balancing out how to improve quality and sell higher price points and remaining focused on opening price points. 
So having Thanksgiving meals in a position where you can buy an entire meal for under $50 for a family of 4 is exciting. So there's a value play and there's a quality play. And wherever the customer goes and how things shifts, we'll be ready to serve them and we're building the capabilities to be able to do that at will."

Regarding the rest, in Q1 and then in Q2, as the backlog of containers worked itself through, that has created a lot of what the issue is today, where we felt good that we would have liked to have had months ago, and then this season is all here at the same time. So we've ingested all that inventory. 
We've largely gotten out of the container storage and movement business. We have the inventory in the network. So we have a good handle on what we own, where it is.

We don't want to kind of get ahead of ourselves just because sales have been strengthening at the end of the quarter."

It's still about 27% inflated per gallon versus a year ago nationally. 
So the absolute spend that an American family is deploying the fuel is still high, not only is the amount of food inflation. And I think Q4 last year is the moment where we started to see U.S. food inflation tick up. It was kind of low to mid-single digits. 
So when you get to Q4, you start to anniversary a food inflation number against a food inflation number. So the 2-year stack of food inflation will be something that we'll be keeping an eye on. If you told us that fuel was going to continue to tick down and that food inflation was going to moderate, that influences how we think about general merchandise inventory. 
And as we worked with the merchants over the last few weeks, it's been kind of fascinating to think through how you make choices item by item and item by -- and category by category because you don't want to go into too much of a defensive mode. And we were looking at Halloween decor last week, John, and there are some things, outdoor decor, in particular like inflatables, that are really fun, cool, new items. 
And when you see them, you're like, we can sell all, you can buy that. Like we're going to blow out of some of those. And we want the buyers in some categories to have that mentality and be aggressive. In other places, we want to be more conservative so that we don't repeat the mistakes that we've had in the first half of this year. 
That's such an interesting thing to work through. It takes a lot more leadership from our merchant team, for example, than it might ordinarily. We think we have made some good decisions subcategory by subcategory for the back half of this year, canceled some orders, trying to get that right area by area so that we don't end up being too conservative in places where we shouldn't be."

It accelerated a lot in the second quarter. Has that continued in the third quarter? And I guess, does the guidance, it assumes it stays at the level of the second quarter? Or do you think it could be up more in 3Q before maybe it fades against the comparisons in the fourth? Any kind of color on what you're assuming would be great.

In relation to -- as it relates to food inflation, it definitely moved up in the second quarter and moved up in the months of the second quarter. So July was higher than June, June was higher than May. 
I think it's too early into the third quarter to try to make a call if this is where we'll be, if it will go higher or go down. So for now, we're assuming that this is the level we're at and it could continue. And some of the factors though to consider is one of the costs that are part of the way we price food is the cost of moving food. So diesel fuel and fuel continue to move down, that could be a tailwind related to inflation. 
However, there's still some commodities up. We do see a few categories in the store where prices are starting to come down, but there are other categories where we're still rising. So I think it's just too early to call in the quarter. Certainly hope that some of these larger macroeconomic conditions would lead to lower prices in food, but we're not able to say that we see that happening just yet."

Last year and the year before, there weren't really many markdowns to speak of because we were chasing demand. And in many cases, the end of the seasons were very clean. 
So returning to a point where there are in the season markdowns is a pretty normal thing that we would experience. And the way we're trying to manage these sell-throughs season by season as compared to historical rates back in 2018, 2019. And of course, things are always going to be different, but it's like a barometer that determine where we land. 
The second, the business is much larger than it was in 2019. So these volume levels continue to improve, which then leads to the dynamic of how much you purchase, which ultimately amount you purchase versus demand will lead you to your sell-through and markdown numbers. 
So for the fourth quarter, we mentioned we've canceled billions in orders. We feel much better about the back half of the year. We still have the inventory to work through and ingest from the backlogs, as we said. So we need a couple of quarters to do that. 
And then heading into the next year, we'll have purchasing levels that are more in line with the way we see demand as it's going today. Of course, a lot can change. We need to know more about fuel pricing and inflation. In the state of the consumers, we get there, but we have definitely had more time and more success in getting purchasing in line with our current inventory levels and the way we see demand going in terms of mix today."

First, let me just say a big thank you to our supply chain team, our merchants. They have been through a lot. The environment has been extremely dynamic, and they have really just made a huge difference for the entire company. 
The last couple of quarters, what's it been like. There was the backlog of containers that really started last fall when the ports backed up. We've worked those through. In terms of container costs, they are down from where they were, but they are still higher than they were a year ago and a year ago was higher than -- it was higher than they were the year before that. 
So still inflated, and those costs are flowing through. Fuel costing, as Doug said earlier, fuel has come down from its peak at the end of Q1, early Q2, but it still remains elevated. And those are real costs that are passed through and customers will see those prices at the counter and on the site. 
So in general, we see better flow. We see better availability. Our availability rates in food, consumables and then our consumable portions of general merchandise are much better than they were a year ago. But I still think we have work to do to get back to where we were back in 2019, but still uneven in places. 
And any time in retail, that inventories back up the way they did, it does cause pressure on being able to get the right inventory at the right location in front of the customer. So optimistic that can improve as these inventories come down, but it's going to take a few more months to work through the backlog of the inventory that's in the network."

One is there are more customers shopping in the brand than what we've seen previously, including better traffic numbers. Fuel prices did come down throughout the month of July. And I think the third that's important is school attendance levels, we think, will be higher. There are very few instances of schools that are remote at this point, and there were some of those last year. So things like backpacks and lunch boxes. 
And then there are other programs where some school lunches were paid for last year that this year will be funded by families and parents. So there's a shift in all of those factors that are leading to more spending late in July and early in the third quarter. 
As far as how it relates to the rest of the year, again, still a lot of unknowns as we get into the rest of the year. Fuel prices are still moving, but they continue to move down, that would be a great thing. And we'll have to watch the shape of the consumer and see how they're buying.

Let me highlight what you'll hear from us this morning. 
First, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments, and our value proposition is resonating with customers and members around the world. We see this in our grocery business in stores and online in key markets like the U.S. and Mexico. Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers. 
Second, we're being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year. There are places where we'll remain aggressive and others where we're being more conservative. 
Third, while we prioritize retail fundamentals, we're also connecting and scaling newer, naturally related capabilities to our larger business so they become mutually reinforcing. Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising are examples. As it relates to the third quarter, it began with top line momentum from the back-to-school season in the U.S. and Mexico, and that continued through festivals in India, China and through early Deals for Days events in the U.S. Walmex had a great quarter and so did Sam's Club in the U.S. as we continued our string of double-digit comp club sales growth. Kath and the team at Sam's have run double-digit comps for almost 3 years. we like the way those numbers compound. 
As a total company, we're seeing strength in stores, clubs and e-commerce. Transactions are positive, and our penetration of e-commerce sales continues to climb. So far this year, 13% of our total sales as a company now start in a digital fashion, and that's led by Walmart International, which is already at 20%. 
With the cost of everyday items still stubbornly high in too many categories, more customers and members are choosing us for the value and assortment we're known for and they're responding to the changes we've made to save them time. With this in mind, we're focusing on earning repeat business from customers who are now shopping with us more frequently than before. 
For example, a strong presentation throughout fresh and apparel are priorities, along with executing pickup and delivery to create a delightful experience that saves them time. And in the case of Walmart U.S., it also means selling more Walmart+ memberships. As more people look to us for value, we want them to see that the experience of shopping with us is also compelling due to the new capabilities we develop. 
Our app experiences around the world are a place where we introduce these newer capabilities. As our app becomes more a part of daily life for our customers and members, they find that they can do so much with it, like easily build a shopping cart, schedule a time to pick up an order or have it delivered when it's convenient for them, skip the line with scan & go or find an item in their local store. 
As you would expect, we're helping families stretch their dollars as we head into the holidays. The Walmart U.S. team has set the retail prices for a typical Thanksgiving meal the same as last year. We're removing inflation on a basket of traditional Thanksgiving food items, including whole turkeys for under $1 per pound. The members' dollar's going further at Sam's Club, too, with racks of lamb and lobster tails priced more than 40% lower than last year. We're also making the everyday shopping trip better by lowering the price of the cafe hot dog combo by nearly 10% to $1.38. 
Around the world, our teams have this type of mindset. In Mexico, we've widened the price gaps in our popular Bodega format by 100 basis points this year. It's incredible value at a time when customers need it most. We're finding creative ways to relieve pressure for families across our merchandise categories and countries. I'm proud of how our associates continue to step up. We're grateful for how they've navigated our inventory challenges this year and continued to prioritize the customer and member experience while doing so. During my store club and DC visits, they inspire me by the way they work together, the way they serve others and how they're embracing change and contributing ideas to improve our business. 
Looking ahead, we updated our outlook for the year on results from Q3, yet we remain balanced in our approach to the rest of Q4 and next year. Inflation is being especially stubborn in some categories like dry grocery. Living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers, especially for those that are most budget-conscious, and so we're focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category. Regardless of income levels, families are more price-conscious now. So it's as important as ever that we earn their trust with value. 
In just a minute, John David will share more about the guidance we gave this morning. We're working to position ourselves to succeed regardless of demand levels through value and experience we offer and the way we're positioning inventory and expenses. 
We're into the details, business by business. This is not a time to paint with a broad brush. We're focused on the things we can control. We delivered good expense leverage during the quarter across our segments. Strong sales growth helps, but we're also doing a good job of managing costs, and we're doing it in a sustainable way. We can keep costs in line and continue to invest in our people and technology, including supply chain automation, and continue to deliver value for customers, members and shareholders. 
We've made good progress to improve our inventory position. Globally, inventory is up 13% for the quarter, including 12.4% for Walmart U.S. and 2.5% for International. Inflation drives the majority of the increase rather than units. In-stock on replenishable items and active management of seasonal item quantities and sell-throughs are the priorities. We expect this progress to continue through the fourth quarter and that will end the year in even better shape. 
Our merchants have taken an item-by-item, category-by-category approach to match inventory with demand. We've worked through a unique period in history as we chased inventory in 2020 and 2021 and were too heavy in some general merchandise categories this year. Given where inflation remains and that economic uncertainty seems higher than normal, the quantity choice our merchants make is even more crucial than in a more normal time, back when there was such a thing as a more normal time. 
We can be more aggressive on shorter lead time items like food and consumables, but we're especially sensitive to quantity decisions on longer-lead time items that are imported. We're thankful to have so many experienced and talented merchants. They've accomplished a lot these past few quarters. Just like John, Kath, Judith and the rest of the team have done, they've demonstrated good judgment and a lot of hustle. 
Our flywheel continues to take shape. We're scaling our newer businesses and connecting them to our larger, established retail businesses, primarily by how we design digital interactions. One example is how our growth in e-commerce, especially the Marketplace, fuels our ad business. More items and sellers drive GMV and improved customer satisfaction. And it also drives success in advertising, they're mutually reinforcing. 
If we double-click on advertising with Walmart Connect in the U.S., we see it's benefiting from growth in e-commerce and from improvements made within the business itself, and we've seen strong growth in return on ad spend over last year. In turn, this helped drive the highest ad spend all year for sponsored search in Q3. These improvements underscore Connect's strengths and position the business for continued growth. 
We also continue to see strong growth with Flipkart Ads in India. Like much of what we're doing, advertising is working for us globally because we have something unique to offer media buyers, and these businesses create momentum for each other. 
As with advertising, growing our Marketplace business also unlocks fulfillment services opportunities through both fulfillment centers and last-mile delivery. We're scaling these businesses in the U.S., and we're starting to ramp up in Mexico and Canada. The team in Mexico increased the number of sellers on our Marketplace by 20% during the quarter. In the U.S., the Marketplace on Walmart.com now offers about 370 million SKUs. That's an increase of more than 50% from Q2. 
Many of these sellers want to leverage our fulfillment network. They also want to use our advertising capabilities to drive demand, and we're making that easier for them. We recently shared that all new Marketplace sellers in the U.S. will be automatically onboarded onto our self-service ad platform. We believe this seamless integration will help both businesses scale even faster. 
What you see in our results is that we can run compelling stores and clubs, scale a first- and third-party e-commerce business and connect them together in an omnichannel fashion that saves customers and members money and time. Our strategy unlocks growth opportunities for us in a thread that runs from digital retail to fulfillment and advertising and opens up even more opportunities with health and wellness and financial services. This quarter demonstrates, again, that we can navigate short-term challenges and build for the long term simultaneously. 
It's been my experience over all these years that Walmart is a well-positioned business and is inherently hedged. When times are good, we have room to grow. When things are more difficult, we sell things people want and need at a value and in ways they want to shop. And with new levers for growth across our flywheel, we're becoming even stronger and more resilient. 
I'll close today by saying thank you for your interest in our company. We like the momentum we are creating in our business, and we recognize the need for a balanced approach in the near term given continued strains on our customers and members. Our team is focused and alert. Happy holidays, everybody. 
Here's John David."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter. I will focus my comments on the themes Doug mentioned. First, our sales momentum and share gains. Second, operational actions we're taking to improve inventory and supply chain. Third, progress we're making to further connect our alternative value streams to our core business. And lastly, our guidance for the balance of the year. 
Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations due to sales upside with operating expense leverage across all 3 business segments. While we're encouraged by our position and our confidence in our business remains high, the macro backdrop remains challenging as persistent inflation is impacting the consumer and our business. 
As I discuss our results, it's important to note the charges related to the opioid legal settlement framework affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q3 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. 
Total constant currency revenue grew 9.8% as our omni model and strong value proposition continue to resonate with customers during this period of broad inflationary pressures. 
Each of our segments delivered strong sales results. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated sequentially to 8.2% growth with increases in average ticket size as well as transactions. Constant currency sales in Walmart International were strong, up 13.3% led by Flipkart and Walmex, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 10.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco. 
Our purpose of saving people money has never been more important as inflation remains consistently high. High fuel prices and mid-teens food inflation have forced consumers to manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We continue to manage pricing in a way that preserves our price gaps while gaining market share profitably. 
Walmart is well positioned to serve customers and gain greater trip frequency during tougher economic periods, and we have even more tools to do so in this cycle. For example, we've continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly 3/4 of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income. This quarter, our private brand penetration in food categories increased about 130 basis points, reflecting customers' increased focus on quality products at value prices. 
We observed incremental trade down in categories, including proteins, baking goods, baby and dog food. We're working hard to keep prices low and help ease the burden to make customers' lives better. This includes working with vendors to reduce product cost and minimize inflation impacts on final goods' pricing. 
Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points. More than half of the decline was due to markdowns and sales mix in the U.S. The remaining headwind reflects a $113 million LIFO charge at Sam's Club due to inflation and the timing of sales events in International, including Flipkart's Big Billion Days. 
Notably, the rate of decline in gross margin improved from 2Q as inventory remediation efforts are progressing. We've been very targeted in reducing certain categories of inventory in our system and our actions included canceling orders and increasing the level of markdowns. The team has done a really good job addressing our inventory situation, as reflected by Q3 inventory being up only 13% versus last year, including 12.4% growth in Walmart U.S. In aggregate, this level represents a more than 10 percentage point improvement versus the end of Q2. 
Notably, about 70% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. We feel good about our ability to sell through the majority of this in Q4 and expect continued year-over-year improvement even when including the effects of inflation. 
We saw stronger expense leverage this quarter as selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 75 basis points due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID cost. We're focused on what we can control and continue to work down inventory levels and manage general and administrative expenses tightly. 
Taking all this together, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis increased 4.6%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.66 but adjusted EPS was $1.50. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.11 impact from unrealized losses on equity investments, primarily JD.com and a $1.05 charge related to the opioid litigation settlement framework. We're pleased that our adjusted EPS outperformed the guidance we provided in August due primarily to better operating expense leverage on higher sales across the business. 
Operating cash flow for the year-to-date period decreased $600 million to $15.7 billion primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases. 
During the quarter, we returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. We're committed to continuing to provide strong cash returns to shareholders while still appropriately investing in our business for the long term. And our Board has just approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization that we expect to utilize over the next several years. 
Let me briefly reference key highlights by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales momentum accelerated in Q3 with a 2-year stack of 17.4%, up 570 basis points from Q2. Monthly sales gains were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Food sales continued to lead with mid-teens growth. We're particularly encouraged to see year-over-year growth in food units sold after experiencing a slight decline last quarter. We also continue to make good progress on improving in-stock levels in our grocery business despite the heavy volumes we're experiencing. 
Inflation remained high, up mid-teens percentage in food categories reflecting an 80 basis point step-up compared to levels at the end of Q2. We've seen incremental levels of inflation month-over-month be less significant, but it's not clear if this represents a sustainable trend. However, we believe our strong price positioning is contributing to share gains as we attract value-seeking customers across the household income spectrum. 
General merchandise sales declined low single digits with softness in electronics, home and apparel. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to 16% growth, even as store transactions continued to grow. We experienced strength in pickup and delivery from stores, Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising. 
Gross profit rate decreased 77 basis points due primarily to higher markdowns and product mix headwinds, but the team delivered strong SG&A expense leverage of 60 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected operating income growth of nearly 5%. 
Walmart International delivered strong sales results, with sales up 13.3% in constant currency despite continued macro headwinds. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis were exceptionally strong, up 46% in the quarter. The earlier timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event was also a benefit to sales results. 
Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $1.5 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, led by a great quarter from Walmex, with comp sales growth of 11.7%, reflecting strong performance in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 17% growth in e-commerce. 
In China, comp sales were up 5.6%, reflecting strong e-commerce growth as well as strength at Sam's Club. E-commerce sales grew 63% and penetration reached 41% of sales. 
Canada comp sales increased more than 5%. And in October, we launched Walmart fulfillment services in Canada, where sellers of all sizes on the digital Marketplace can now contract with us to take care of their inventory storage and logistics needs. The new offering will provide faster shipping of customer orders within a 2-day window to 95% of Canadians. 
In India, Flipkart had a great quarter with strong customer response to our Big Billion Days event, which moved forward into Q3 this year from Q4 last year. We had over 1 billion visits to our site during the 8-day event and, importantly, saw more than 60% of those customers coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. 
PhonePe also continues to perform well with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, now over $920 billion and reaching a record level of monthly transactions to about $3.6 billion. This was the first time PhonePe had a quarter with more than 10 billion transactions. 
International segment operating income was better than expected and increased 3.2% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China. 
In Sam's Club U.S., we had another strong quarter with comp sales up more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and an increase of more than 25% on a 2-year stack. Both comp transactions and average ticket increased about 5%. And e-commerce sales grew 20% with strength in curbside orders and ship to home. Membership income was up 8% with another record high quarter in overall member counts, at an all-time high, plus member penetration. 
Sam's leveraged expenses 68 basis points due primarily to higher sales. This helped offset a decline in gross profit rate due primarily to a 53 basis point or $113 million inflation-related LIFO charge. 
For the quarter, Sam's operating income increased more than 18% with fuel and nearly 8% excluding fuel and including the impact of the LIFO charge. 
Combining these results with my comments about International, you can see Sam's Club is performing well around the world, and we're pleased with the leverage we see across markets with Member's Mark as an example. 
As we navigate changes to our external environment, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives that were enabled by our omnichannel retail capabilities. Globally, as we're building a larger e-commerce business, we're scaling our Marketplace which unlocks and strengthens our fulfillment and advertising businesses and expands the number of families that choose to be members. 
Across our segments, e-commerce is enabling deeper engagement with customers and members that helps drive strategic growth in our alternative value streams. New sellers in our U.S. Marketplace are contributing to our advertising growth and we added more than 8,000 sellers in Q3. 
Third-party build-out helps diversify and strengthen our product assortment, which now includes more than 370 million SKUs. 
Strong digital advertising growth continued this quarter, increasing over 30% on a global basis, led by 40% growth in Walmart Connect in the U.S. and Flipkart Ads in India. 
As we focus on membership, our ability to leverage our data improves, so we continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering, Walmart Luminate, and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow. We gained some of these new Wamart+ members after expanding our last mile delivery capabilities through a fourfold increase since January and the number of pickup points serviced by the Spark Driver platform. 
We're making good progress in fulfillment and automation. The Spark Driver platform now serves customers in all 50 states for more than 10,000 pickup points with the ability to reach 84% of all U.S. households. This coverage includes a growing revenue stream from businesses utilizing Walmart GoLocal, our delivery as a service offering, has already made over 1 million deliveries since launching last year. 
Building Walmart fulfillment services in the U.S., Mexico and now also in Canada has been an important asset in growing our seller base as they seek an integrated omni sales and fulfillment solution. For example, almost 30% of orders on Walmex' marketplace are now being fulfilled using Walmart fulfillment services which was launched a year ago. 
In September, we opened a next-gen fulfillment center in Illinois. This 1.1 million square foot facility features robotics, machine learning and automated storage, resulting in increased productivity and a better service for our customers at faster delivery times. 
And last week, we acquired Alert Innovation as we expand our market fulfillment center build-out. MFCs are positioned inside or attached to Walmart supercenters and use robotics and AI to fill online orders more quickly. We're putting the building blocks in place to deliver powerful, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that not only benefits customers and partners, but also shareholders, with more durable and diversified earnings streams. 
Turning to guidance. In this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we are well equipped to continue gaining market share in an environment where consumers need to stretch their dollars further. We will continue to advocate for customers and work with our supplier partners to maintain strong price gaps and deliver lower relative pricing versus competitors. We're also navigating real inflation on our own cost structure and continue to seek ways to reduce cost and improve leverage potential. 
With these considerations in mind, we're maintaining a balanced approach to our guidance. incorporating a cautious view on the consumer together with our confidence in our ability to execute. We're updating fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the Q3 upside and leaving our sales and profit assumptions for Q4 unchanged. Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, especially in general merchandise categories, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables. Our guidance provides flexibility to compete in a promotional environment, accounts for pricing action to reduce remaining excess inventory and anticipates ongoing mix pressure. 
For Q4, we expect net sales growth of about 3%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., with food and consumables growth continuing to outpace general merchandise. We expect year-over-year operating income within a range of a 1% increase to a 1% decrease. And adjusted EPS is expected to decrease 3% to 5%, including higher year-over-year tax and interest expenses. 
For the full year, incorporating the Q3 upside, we now expect net sales growth of about 5.5%, including comp sales growth of 5.5% for Walmart U.S. On an adjusted basis, we expect operating income to decline 6.5% to 7.5% and EPS to decline 6% to 7%. Excluding the effect of divestitures and on an adjusted basis, this would translate into net sales growth of 6.5% and a decline in operating income of 5.5% to 6.5% and a decline in EPS of 5% to 6%. 
Looking beyond Q4, we know some of the unanticipated costs experienced this year shouldn't repeat next year. That said, we're planning our business with the assumption that inflation remains somewhat elevated. In addition, we've had significant currency headwinds this year. Based on year-to-date results and current FX rates, we estimate a year-over-year sales headwind for this fiscal year of $4.1 billion from currency and a potential sales headwind of about $3 billion next year. 
Also, as we've had $236 million in LIFO charges this year at Sam's Club, we're likely to experience LIFO charges in Walmart U.S. as well next year. Based on current assumptions, these LIFO charges next year for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $1 billion of gross profit headwind. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors that are challenging to predict will influence the aggregate amount. We're committed to providing you ongoing updates to the assumptions as we report our quarterly results. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

First, I think the team here and the merchants, supply chain teams have done a really nice job improving the year-on-year results from second quarter into the end of third quarter.

First, I think the team here and the merchants, supply chain teams have done a really nice job improving the year-on-year results from second quarter into the end of third quarter. As we said earlier, up about 12.4%. That's down from just over 26% in the second quarter. 
The first thing I think is important to consider, if you look back over the quarters of the year, in Q1 when we were the highest, the majority of the extra inventory was in supply chain and part of the backlog problem, then the second quarter that balanced more evenly between stores and the total, and in this quarter, at the end of Q3, what we see is an increase of 12.4%,  but the stores are still heavy. So the inventory has moved from the supply chain to a balanced and now it's in the store. And when you look at the dollar amount that's up, about 70% of it, 3/4 of it roughly is inflation and the rest we can approximate to pretty significant improvements in in-stock over last year. Last year, we were quite low. So we see a really [ recent ] improvement in in-stock. 
And then specifically on your last question, probably around something just under $1 billion, around $1 billion would be what will we consider excess. That's down pretty significantly, about 1/3 of where we were at the end of Q2. So we're making improvements. Apparel and certain categories in GM are the heavy categories, and we'll continue to work through those. 
And just a reminder, we said at the beginning of Q1, we needed a couple of quarters to work through the inventory and we continue to do that. And then John David did mention in his commentary that there is room in our forecast to continue making progress on inventory. 
But I was in an [ import ] center last week, and the inbound is in really good shape. The orders are in line. So I think the team have done a really nice job adjusting to the end of the year."

That second category of nonreplenishable items, which are often features, we're managing that aggressively category by category and don't want to get too conservative. There are some places where we should still play offense through this quarter and into next year. 
And then lastly, I think it was appropriate for us the last couple of quarters to break out how much inventory we wish we didn't have. That number is getting down to the point where we probably won't be talking about that going forward, because we always have some inventory we don't want, even in a more normal circumstance. So we've made a lot of progress, feeling a lot better about it."

First, I'd say the core business is continuing to perform pretty well in the face of a difficult macro environment. But we do have headwinds next year, as we called out, both currency as well as the LIFO charge. 
The LIFO charge is a result of the inflationary environment that we're in, and it's heavily dependent upon what our inflation and inventory assumptions are next year. For planning purposes, we're basically assuming that prices stay where they are. The result on a year-over-year basis from an inflation perspective would be a little north of 3%, it's a little greater than 3%. And to the extent that, that changes, that affects that $1 billion estimate. 
But I think it's important to note that to the extent that we get back to a deflationary retail cost environment, this $1 billion headwind actually reverses out as a benefit in latter periods."

Yes, we saw a really strong quarter for international at 13%. Sales growth was encouraging. 
The real stories in here are that we are really starting to see the benefits of the diversification and portfolio work that we did over the last few years. That's led us to being able to focus where it matters across the International portfolio. And I'm definitely seeing the benefit of that as we look across the last couple of quarters of growth and profitability that we've seen. 
For the quarter specifically, maybe 2 markets to call out. We called out Flipkart, but to give you a little bit of color on that. The Big Billion Days event fell into Q3 for this year. It was in Q4 last year. That created some kind of differences in our results between Q3 and Q4, which we've called out. But that is an event which is designed to try to bring new customers onboard for Flipkart. And it looks to have been successful in doing that again. A billion visits over the 8 days of the event shows you the amount of traffic that, that generates and those customers shopping many of them for the first time. So Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and we've been pleased with the quarter. 
The other market I would call out is Mexico. So a really strong result from Mexico. They saw double-digit sales growth and strong profit growth as well. What's really encouraging there is not only their focus on their core business, but equally the focus that they're having on building up solutions for customers across their ecosystem. So their [ cash e-payment ] business [ that bites ] telecom business, the emerging health care businesses are all helping drive that customer connectivity back into the business. And they're proving to be a real powerhouse for the International segment. 
Across the other markets, maybe the only other market that I would highlight is China, which leads the way from an e-commerce perspective. So our e-commerce penetration for the quarter was 23%. But we also saw in China a 41% e-commerce penetration, and we're learning a lot from that market about how to deal with those kind of volumes, of deliveries and e-commerce as well in Sam's Club and is a real great format therefore in sharing much of the private brand and much of the innovation that Sam's Club in the U.S. is bringing through. 
I think it is that focus on the core business, making sure that our omnichannel capabilities around the world that are strong and also in looking at how we can make sure that we build out these ecosystems which are mutually reinforcing is what will help drive us for the future, too."

I think we have a pretty simple flywheel that's been sitting at the heart of driving the growth over the last 3 years. And it all starts with creating a member-obsessed culture. If you do that, you can't help but create items and services that members love. If you create items members love, you can buy deep and get cost advantages that you pass on to the member. And if you have great items at disruptive prices and you open up the channels of access like Judith talked about, then you can't help but drive membership income. And as we've driven that, we've been able to take some of the funds back and invest it in our associates to then help create this member-obsessed culture. And that is the flywheel that's just been fueling the 11 quarters of double-digit comp. 
I think as you kind of look at that, you can also see our membership income has been up kind of high single digits over the -- kind of over the 3-year period as well. And so it's really just reinforcing flywheel. 
If you think about Member's Mark, our Member's Mark item is actually made with and for our members. So we have 40,000 members who give us counsel on the items before we launch them to market, which means that they always launch successfully and we end up with about a 4.2 star rating minimum on our Member's Mark items. That's creating items that members love and they ensure that they're successful when they're launched. That's part of the magic that's sitting in that growth of 11 quarters."

The offering has grown pretty significantly just in the last quarter. The count of item's up about 50% which positions us well in categories like apparel as we look forward and also other strong categories like home.

And then the second question is maybe to John David, the timing of LIFO. Is it -- a lot of companies experienced a lot of LIFO pressure during '22 because of how high inflation was. Why has it lagged? Is it because you lagged the pricing that [indiscernible] into your price? Is it other -- is there some other dynamic with LIFO that you had some reserves?

First is, as we talked about it in our prepared remarks, we gained share during the period, which in this time of high inflation that's putting pressure on the consumers, it shows that our value proposition is more relevant than ever. At the same time, there's also been an extreme focus on the expense side of the business. And so you see that we leveraged by almost 80 basis points in the quarter as we're continuing to focus on providing the best products to our customers but in the most efficient way that we can. And so those will be the 2 areas that I would call out that are most notable in terms of the outperformance. 
With respect to LIFO, what we've experienced this year with the over $200 million of LIFO charges has been entirely related to Sam's. Sam's uses the weighted average cost method for their inventory accounting. Walmart uses RAM, a retail inventory method. And so there's a slight nuance difference there that results in the lag. But our expectation, given that we think that these prices will persist, is that Walmart U.S. will then -- will soon begin incurring these charges as well. 
In terms of the timing of next year, it's more front-loaded than the back half of the year."

A lot of people may come to us for Tide or come to us for bananas, but they may not buy a T-shirt or a sweater. We've got really high market shares in some general merchandise categories which would tell you a lot of America shops at Walmart. 
And during a period of time when people are more sensitive to price, it makes sense that they would increase the amount of their wallet that would be coming to Walmart because of value. So that's what's happening. 
So that leads you to the second question, which is can you keep them? And I think some of the things John mentioned a minute ago, like pickup and delivery help. But as I mentioned in my remarks, fresh food and apparel are other areas, home's another one, where if we can stand tall during this period of time, we think they'll keep coming back to us because we do have quality, we do have value and we've created a lot more ways for them to save time in the store and we pick up in delivery.

And for a long time, we talked about the value of a store customer plus shopping on e-com, how much more valuable that was. We see that accelerate when it's pickup, e-commerce and stores. So going forward, you'll hear us talk about this more and more as an omni offer which is really flexible for the customer and doing things like having options for Thanksgiving meal that are priced the same as last year are really helpful at a time when customers are feeling the pressure of inflation. 
And then the last thing, regionally, no real differences to report in the third quarter across the geographies. We saw strength in many geographies.

At the start of your prepared remarks, Doug, you mentioned that you're aiming to bring down prices for consumers. As we move into next year, it's likely that some of the pressures that caused all the inflation in consumer goods will start to recede. How is Walmart going to handle that? Could you actually see prices come down? And that's important given that Walmart tends to be the price-setter across a lot of consumer goods, and you're going to have this growing pool of alternative profit from what you can actually support lower prices into next year. 
And then my follow-up question is for John David. John David, you provided a couple of [ lease ] parameters for how to think about 2023 between the $1 billion LIFO headwind to gross margin and the $3 billion of FX drag to sales next year. Does that mean we should expect that 2023 is going to be a sub algo year for Walmart of achieving 4% top line growth and 4.5% operating income growth?

The 4% and greater than 4% numbers are certainly on our mind, and that indicates that we think we can grow the operating income percentage of the company over time. 
As we navigate next year, that will be one factor that we're thinking about. Obviously, we'll be thinking about customers and members as well and driving top line and growing share. So we'll be navigating it basically week to week, month to month as things change. And commodities like [indiscernible] categories have already started to respond. They moved quickly based on demand, there'll be volatility in categories like fresh food. The general merchandise categories have started to move as demand softens. And things like transportation cost change. We've seen some downward movement in general merchandise. And I think that will continue [indiscernible] in the next year to some degree. And we'll manage margins in a price gap in general merchandise department by department, category by category as we always do, but have an eye towards leading down while protecting profitability as much as we can. 
I think dry grocery and consumables will be more stubborn. Wage rates have gone up, and that won't change. And some input costs have been high for those categories. That's the area where we need to partner even more with our suppliers and come up with more creative solutions and try to do the best we can of relieving that pressure for customers and members.

So I would encourage you to think about that over a multiyear basis. That's a framework to think about the opportunity that we have in our business. We're calling that out now because it's a headwind that we recognize we're going to encounter. But shouldn't take away from the tremendous growth opportunities that we have with our changing business model, moving more to a scaled omnichannel retailer as we invest in things like Marketplace, advertising, fulfillment services. And so all of those things give us a lot of conviction that, that growth algorithm is well in place. But I would encourage you to think about that over a multiyear period."

We don't expect to live in this era of high inflation forever. I certainly hope not. And so if we do get back to what we've seen over the last 3 decades, you would expect that to reverse out in a reasonably quick time period. So this is not something that if we get back to a normal environment, it's going to take years to reverse out. So what you said is generally correct.

We see in the world move more online. I think we are unique in our ability to be a skilled omnichannel retailer. And so when you consider things like advertising or fulfillment services, these are areas of our business that not only are faster-growing, they have a higher margin associated with them. 
And so that's included when we contemplate our growth algorithm. So hopefully, we look up a number of years from now and we've got a much more diverse and durable earnings stream that also there's a different multiple ascribed to those earning streams than what exists today.

What we've seen really for the last 3 years up until Q1 of this year was a flat private brand penetration, not much movement in '19, 2021. And then the movement, the trading to private brands from other brands really started in about March of this year. And then as we said in the quarter, it's increased its penetration in the food categories by about 130 basis points. So a relatively decent amount has moved into private brands. 
As far as comparisons to prior periods, I think the last time we would be able to say anything about this is probably 12 to 13 years ago. So I don't think I have anything today to offer with specificity other than what we've seen in the last 3 quarters is quite a bit of switching amongst some consumers. Now there are other consumers that are trading to Walmart that are not trading in private brands. They're branded customers and they're buying more premium items. 
So again, I would just repeat the fact that we positioned ourselves in terms of merchandising in the portfolio and with the channels by which we serve customers in a very flexible way so that we can help customers in whatever economic situation they're in and we'll be ready for the rest of the year."

I'll start and others can jump in. This is John David. Look, one of the biggest impacts in our business this year has been the change in mix, particularly as we think about the U.S. business, where the margin profile is different on general merchandise versus food and consumables. We don't have an assumption that, that bounces back rapidly next year. And with continued high prices, the consumer continuing to be pressured, we expect to have that mix effect effects prolong into next year. 
So I know there's hope that things would bounce back. And certainly, some of the onetime costs that we've incurred this year related to supply chain are not going to repeat next year, but the consumer is stressed. One of the things that's assisted that thus far is relatively strong balance sheets among consumers assisted by stimulus payments. That's not going to last forever. So that's why we take a rather cautious view on the consumer. 
But at the same time, as all of us have mentioned, this is when our value proposition really shines, when customers are looking for value. And it's not just value, it's also product assortment. One of the things that John mentioned, and I think it's worth repeating, but it's not just the 370 million SKUs that we're offering between first-party and third-party e-commerce, it's the acceleration of that. That's a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter. And it shows you that not only are we providing products at the price point that customers want, we're providing additional products and assortment for them to buy."

We've made some progress with inventory, as we said, quarter-to-quarter, from high 20s to just over 12% over the last year. So having an inventory position that's strong going into the year with some flexibility is a really important part to be able to maneuver any environment that we get into.

So the entire assortment, up to 350-plus million items, are all there in 1 place. So I think we're positioned well to be able to navigate.

Let me highlight what you'll hear from us this morning.  First, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments, and o",1699,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter. Let me highlight what you'll hear from us this morning.  
First, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments, and our value proposition is resonating with customers and members around the world. We see this in our grocery business in stores and online in key markets like the U.S. and Mexico. Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers.  
Second, we're being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year. There are places where we'll remain aggressive and others where we're being more conservative.  
Third, while we prioritize retail fundamentals, we're also connecting and scaling newer, naturally related capabilities to our larger business so they become mutually reinforcing. Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising are examples. As it relates to the third quarter, it began with top-line momentum from the back-to-school season in the U.S. and Mexico, and that continued through festivals in India, China and through early Deals for Days events in the U.S. Walmex had a great quarter and so did Sam's Club in the U.S. as we continued our string of double-digit comp club sales growth. Kath and the team at Sam's have run double-digit comps for almost 3 years. We like the way those numbers compound.  
As a total company, we're seeing strength in stores, clubs and e-commerce. Transactions are positive, and our penetration of e-commerce sales continues to climb. So far this year, 13% of our total sales as a company now start in a digital fashion, and that's led by Walmart International, which is already at 20%.  
With the cost of everyday items still stubbornly high in too many categories, more customers and members are choosing us for the value and assortment we're known for and they're responding to the changes we've made to save them time. With this in mind, we're focusing on earning repeat business from customers who are now shopping with us more frequently than before.  
For example, a strong presentation throughout fresh and apparel are priorities, along with executing pickup and delivery to create a delightful experience that saves them time. And in the case of Walmart U.S., it also means selling more Walmart+ memberships. As more people look to us for value, we want them to see that the experience of shopping with us is also compelling due to the new capabilities we develop.  
Our app experiences around the world are a place where we introduce these newer capabilities. As our app becomes more a part of daily life for our customers and members, they find that they can do so much with it, like easily build a shopping cart, schedule a time to pick up an order or have it delivered when it's convenient for them, skip the line with scan & go or find an item in their local store. As you would expect, we're helping families stretch their dollars as we head into the holidays. The Walmart U.S. team has set the retail prices for a typical Thanksgiving meal the same as last year. We're removing inflation on a basket of traditional Thanksgiving food items, including whole turkeys for under $1 per pound.  
The members' dollar's going further at Sam's Club, too, with racks of lamb and lobster tails priced more than 40% lower than last year. We're also making the everyday shopping trip better by lowering the price of the cafe hot dog combo by nearly 10% to $1.38.  
Around the world, our teams have this type of mindset. In Mexico, we've widened the price gaps in our popular Bodega format by 100 basis points this year. It's incredible value at a time when customers need it most. We're finding creative ways to relieve pressure for families across our merchandise categories and countries. I'm proud of how our associates continue to step up. We're grateful for how they've navigated our inventory challenges this year and continued to prioritize the customer and member experience while doing so. During my store club and DC visits, they inspire me by the way they work together, the way they serve others and how they're embracing change and contributing ideas to improve our business.  
Looking ahead, we updated our outlook for the year on results from Q3, yet we remained balanced in our approach to the rest of Q4 and next year. Inflation is being especially stubborn in some categories like dry grocery. Living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers, especially for those that are most budget-conscious, and so we're focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category. Regardless of income levels, families are more price-conscious now. So it's as important as ever that we earn their trust with value.  
In just a minute, John David will share more about the guidance we gave this morning. We're working to position ourselves to succeed regardless of demand levels through value and the experience we offer and the way we're positioning inventory and expenses. We're into the details, business by business. This is not a time to paint with a broad brush. We're focused on the things we can control. We delivered good expense leverage during the quarter across our segments. Strong sales growth helps, but we're also doing a good job of managing costs, and we're doing it in a sustainable way. We can keep costs in line and continue to invest in our people and technology, including supply chain automation, and continue to deliver value for customers, members and shareholders.  
We've made good progress to improve our inventory position. Globally, inventory is up 13% for the quarter, including 12.4% for Walmart U.S. and 2.5% for International. Inflation drives the majority of the increase rather than units. In-stock on replenishable items and active management of seasonal item quantities and sell-throughs are the priorities. We expect this progress to continue through the fourth quarter and that will end the year in even better shape.  
Our merchants have taken an item-by-item, category-by-category approach to match inventory with demand. We've worked through a unique period in history as we chased inventory in 2020 and 2021 and were too heavy in some general merchandise categories this year. Given where inflation remains and that economic uncertainty seems higher than normal, the quantity choice our merchants make is even more crucial than in a more normal time back when there was such a thing as a more normal time.  
We can be more aggressive on shorter lead time items like food and consumables, but we're especially sensitive to quantity decisions on longer-lead time items that are imported. We're thankful to have so many experienced and talented merchants. They've accomplished a lot these past few quarters. Just like John, Kath, Judith and the rest of the team have done, they've demonstrated good judgment and a lot of hustle.  
Our flywheel continues to take shape. We're scaling our newer businesses and connecting them to our larger, established retail businesses, primarily by how we design digital interactions. One example is how our growth in e-commerce, especially the Marketplace, fuels our ad business. More items and sellers drive GMV and improved customer satisfaction. And it also drives success in advertising, they're mutually reinforcing.  
If we double-click on advertising with Walmart Connect in the U.S., we see it's benefiting from growth in e-commerce and from improvements made within the business itself, and we've seen strong growth in return on ad spend over last year. In turn, this helped drive the highest ad spend all year for sponsored search in Q3. These improvements underscore Connect's strengths and position the business for continued growth.  
We also continue to see strong growth with Flipkart Ads in India. Like much of what we're doing, advertising is working for us globally because we have something unique to offer media buyers, and these businesses create momentum for each other.  
As with advertising, growing our Marketplace business also unlocks fulfillment services opportunities through both fulfillment centers and last-mile delivery. We're scaling these businesses in the U.S., and we're starting to ramp up in Mexico and Canada. The team in Mexico increased the number of sellers on our Marketplace by 20% during the quarter. In the U.S., the Marketplace on Walmart.com now offers about 370 million SKUs. That's an increase of more than 50% from Q2.  
Many of these sellers want to leverage our fulfillment network. They also want to use our advertising capabilities to drive demand, and we're making that easier for them. We recently shared that all new Marketplace sellers in the U.S. will be automatically onboarded onto our self-service ad platform. We believe this seamless integration will help both businesses scale even faster.  
What you see in our results is that we can run compelling stores and clubs, scale a first- and third-party e-commerce business and connect them together in an omnichannel fashion that saves customers and members money and time. Our strategy unlocks growth opportunities for us in a thread that runs from digital retail to fulfillment and advertising and opens up even more opportunities with health and wellness and financial services. This quarter demonstrates, again, that we can navigate short-term challenges and build for the long term simultaneously.  
It's been my experience over all these years that Walmart is a well-positioned business and is inherently hedged. When times are good, we have room to grow. When things are more difficult, we sell things people want and need at a value and in ways they want to shop. And with new levers for growth across our flywheel, we're becoming even stronger and more resilient.  
I'll close today by saying thank you for your interest in our company. We like the momentum we are creating in our business, and we recognize the need for a balanced approach in the near term given continued strains on our customers and members. Our team is focused and alert. Happy holidays, everybody. 
Here's John David."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter. I will focus my comments on the themes Doug mentioned. First, our sales momentum and share gains. Second, operational actions we're taking to improve inventory and supply chain. Third, progress we're making to further connect our alternative value streams to our core business. And lastly, our guidance for the balance of the year.  
Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations due to sales upside with operating expense leverage across all 3 business segments. While we're encouraged by our position and our confidence in our business remains high, the macro backdrop remains challenging as persistent inflation is impacting the consumer and our business.  
As I discuss our results, it's important to note the charges related to the opioid legal settlement framework affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q3 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items.  
Total constant currency revenue grew 9.8% as our omni model and strong value proposition continue to resonate with customers during this period of broad inflationary pressures. 
Each of our segments delivered strong sales results. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated sequentially to 8.2% growth with increases in average ticket size as well as transactions. Constant currency sales in Walmart International were strong, up 13.3% led by Flipkart and Walmex, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 10.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.  
Our purpose of saving people money has never been more important as inflation remains consistently high. High fuel prices and mid-teens food inflation have forced consumers to manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We continue to manage pricing in a way that preserves our price gaps while gaining market share profitably.  
Walmart is well positioned to serve customers and gain greater trip frequency during tougher economic periods, and we have even more tools to do so in this cycle. For example, we've continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly 3/4 of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income. This quarter, our private brand penetration in food categories increased about 130 basis points, reflecting customers' increased focus on quality products at value prices.  
We observed incremental trade down in categories, including proteins, baking goods, baby and dog food. We're working hard to keep prices low and help ease the burden to make customers' lives better. This includes working with vendors to reduce product cost and minimize inflation impacts on final goods' pricing.  
Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points. More than half of the decline was due to markdowns and sales mix in the U.S. The remaining headwind reflects a $113 million LIFO charge at Sam's Club due to inflation and the timing of sales events in International, including Flipkart's Big Billion Days.  
Notably, the rate of decline in gross margin improved from 2Q as inventory remediation efforts are progressing. We've been very targeted in reducing certain categories of inventory in our system and our actions included canceling orders and increasing the level of markdowns. The team has done a really good job addressing our inventory situation, as reflected by Q3 inventory being up only 13% versus last year, including 12.4% growth in Walmart U.S. In aggregate, this level represents a more than 10 percentage point improvement versus the end of Q2.  
Notably, about 70% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. We feel good about our ability to sell through the majority of this in Q4 and expect continued year-over-year improvement even when including the effects of inflation.  
We saw stronger expense leverage this quarter as selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 75 basis points due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID cost. We're focused on what we can control and continue to work down inventory levels and manage general and administrative expenses tightly.  
Taking all this together, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis increased 4.6%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.66 but adjusted EPS was $1.50. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.11 impact from unrealized losses on equity investments, primarily JD.com and a $1.05 charge related to the opioid litigation settlement framework. We're pleased that our adjusted EPS outperformed the guidance we provided in August due primarily to better operating expense leverage on higher sales across the business.  
Operating cash flow for the year-to-date period decreased $600 million to $15.7 billion primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases.  
During the quarter, we returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. We're committed to continuing to provide strong cash returns to shareholders while still appropriately investing in our business for the long term. And our Board has just approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization that we expect to utilize over the next several years.  
Let me briefly reference key highlights by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales momentum accelerated in Q3 with a 2-year stack of 17.4%, up 570 basis points from Q2. Monthly sales gains were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Food sales continued to lead with mid-teens growth. We're particularly encouraged to see year-over-year growth in food units sold after experiencing a slight decline last quarter. We also continue to make good progress on improving in-stock levels in our grocery business despite the heavy volumes we're experiencing.  
Inflation remained high, up mid-teens percentage in food categories reflecting an 80 basis point step-up compared to levels at the end of Q2. We've seen incremental levels of inflation month-over-month be less significant, but it's not clear if this represents a sustainable trend. However, we believe our strong price positioning is contributing to share gains as we attract value-seeking customers across the household income spectrum.  
General merchandise sales declined low single digits with softness in electronics, home and apparel. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to 16% growth, even as store transactions continued to grow. We experienced strength in pickup and delivery from stores, Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising.  
Gross profit rate decreased 77 basis points due primarily to higher markdowns and product mix headwinds, but the team delivered strong SG&A expense leverage of 60 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected operating income growth of nearly 5%.  
Walmart International delivered strong sales results, with sales up 13.3% in constant currency despite continued macro headwinds. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis were exceptionally strong, up 46% in the quarter. The earlier timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event was also a benefit to sales results.  
Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $1.5 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, led by a great quarter from Walmex, with comp sales growth of 11.7%, reflecting strong performance in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 17% growth in e-commerce.  
In China, comp sales were up 5.6%, reflecting strong e-commerce growth as well as strength at Sam's Club. E-commerce sales grew 63% and penetration reached 41% of sales.
Canada comp sales increased more than 5%. And in October, we launched Walmart fulfillment services in Canada, where sellers of all sizes on the digital Marketplace can now contract with us to take care of their inventory storage and logistics needs. The new offering will provide faster shipping of customer orders within a 2-day window to 95% of Canadians.  
In India, Flipkart had a great quarter with strong customer response to our Big Billion Days event, which moved forward into Q3 this year from Q4 last year. We had over 1 billion visits to our site during the 8-day event and, importantly, saw more than 60% of those customers coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.  
PhonePe also continues to perform well with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, now over $920 billion and reaching a record level of monthly transactions to about $3.6 billion. This was the first time PhonePe had a quarter with more than 10 billion transactions.  
International segment operating income was better than expected and increased 3.2% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China.  
In Sam's Club U.S., we had another strong quarter with comp sales up more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and an increase of more than 25% on a 2-year stack. Both comp transactions and average ticket increased about 5%. And e-commerce sales grew 20% with strength in curbside orders and ship to home. Membership income was up 8% with another record high quarter in overall member counts, at an all-time high, plus member penetration.  
Sam's leveraged expenses 68 basis points due primarily to higher sales. This helped offset a decline in gross profit rate due primarily to a 53 basis point or $113 million inflation-related LIFO charge.  
For the quarter, Sam's operating income increased more than 18% with fuel and nearly 8% excluding fuel and including the impact of the LIFO charge.  
Combining these results with my comments about International, you can see Sam's Club is performing well around the world, and we're pleased with the leverage we see across markets with Member's Mark as an example.  
As we navigate changes to our external environment, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives that were enabled by our omnichannel retail capabilities. Globally, as we're building a larger e-commerce business, we're scaling our Marketplace which unlocks and strengthens our fulfillment and advertising businesses and expands the number of families that choose to be members.  
Across our segments, e-commerce is enabling deeper engagement with customers and members that helps drive strategic growth in our alternative value streams. New sellers in our U.S. Marketplace are contributing to our advertising growth and we added more than 8,000 sellers in Q3.  
Third-party build-out helps diversify and strengthen our product assortment, which now includes more than 370 million SKUs.  
Strong digital advertising growth continued this quarter, increasing over 30% on a global basis, led by 40% growth in Walmart Connect in the U.S. and Flipkart Ads in India.  
As we focus on membership, our ability to leverage our data improves, so we continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering, Walmart Luminate, and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow. We gained some of these new Walmart+ members after expanding our last mile delivery capabilities through a fourfold increase since January and the number of pickup points serviced by the Spark Driver platform.  
We're making good progress in fulfillment and automation. The Spark Driver platform now serves customers in all 50 states for more than 10,000 pickup points with the ability to reach 84% of all U.S. households. This coverage includes a growing revenue stream from businesses utilizing Walmart GoLocal. Our delivery-as-a-service offering, has already made over 1 million deliveries since launching last year.  
Building Walmart fulfillment services in the U.S., Mexico and now also in Canada has been an important asset in growing our seller base as they seek an integrated omni sales and fulfillment solution. For example, almost 30% of orders on Walmex' marketplace are now being fulfilled using Walmart fulfillment services which was launched a year ago.  
In September, we opened a next-gen fulfillment center in Illinois. This 1.1 million square foot facility features robotics, machine learning and automated storage, resulting in increased productivity and a better service for our customers at faster delivery times.  
And last week, we acquired Alert Innovation as we expand our market fulfillment center build-out. MFCs are positioned inside or attached to Walmart supercenters and use robotics and AI to fill online orders more quickly. We're putting the building blocks in place to deliver powerful, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that not only benefits customers and partners, but also shareholders, with more durable and diversified earnings streams.  
Turning to guidance. In this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we are well equipped to continue gaining market share in an environment where consumers need to stretch their dollars further. We will continue to advocate for customers and work with our supplier partners to maintain strong price gaps and deliver lower relative pricing versus competitors. We're also navigating real inflation on our own cost structure and continue to seek ways to reduce cost and improve leverage potential.  
With these considerations in mind, we're maintaining a balanced approach to our guidance, incorporating a cautious view on the consumer together with our confidence in our ability to execute. We're updating fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the Q3 upside and leaving our sales and profit assumptions for Q4 unchanged. Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, especially in general merchandise categories, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables. Our guidance provides flexibility to compete in a promotional environment, accounts for pricing action to reduce remaining excess inventory and anticipates ongoing mix pressure.
For Q4, we expect net sales growth of about 3%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., with food and consumables growth continuing to outpace general merchandise. We expect year-over-year operating income within a range of a 1% increase to a 1% decrease. And adjusted EPS is expected to decrease 3% to 5%, including higher year-over-year tax and interest expenses.  
For the full year, incorporating the Q3 upside, we now expect net sales growth of about 5.5%, including comp sales growth of 5.5% for Walmart U.S. On an adjusted basis, we expect operating income to decline 6.5% to 7.5% and EPS to decline 6% to 7%. Excluding the effect of divestitures and on an adjusted basis, this would translate into net sales growth of 6.5% and a decline in operating income of 5.5% to 6.5% and a decline in EPS of 5% to 6%.  
Looking beyond Q4, we know some of the unanticipated costs experienced this year shouldn't repeat next year. That said, we're planning our business with the assumption that inflation remains somewhat elevated. In addition, we've had significant currency headwinds this year. Based on year-to-date results and current FX rates, we estimate a year-over-year sales headwind for this fiscal year of $4.1 billion from currency and a potential sales headwind of about $3 billion next year.  
Also, as we've had $236 million in LIFO charges this year at Sam's Club, we're likely to experience LIFO charges in Walmart U.S. as well next year. Based on current assumptions, these LIFO charges next year for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $1 billion of gross profit headwind. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors that are challenging to predict will influence the aggregate amount. We're committed to providing you ongoing updates to the assumptions as we report our quarterly results.  
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

First, I think the team here and the merchants, supply chain teams have done a really nice job improving the year-on-year results from second quarter into the end of third quarter. As we said earlier, up about",355,"Sure. Kate, a couple of things on inventory. First, I think the team here and the merchants, supply chain teams have done a really nice job improving the year-on-year results from second quarter into the end of third quarter. As we said earlier, up about 12.4%. That's down from just over 26% at the end of the second quarter.  
The first thing I think is important to consider, if you look back over the quarters of the year, in Q1 when we were the highest, the majority of the extra inventory was in supply chain and part of the backlog problem, then the second quarter that balanced more evenly between stores and the total, and in this quarter, at the end of Q3, what we see is an increase of 12.4%, but the stores are still heavy. So the inventory has moved from the supply chain to a balanced and now it's in the store. And when you look at the dollar amount that's up, about 70% of it, 3/4 of it roughly is inflation and the rest we can approximate to pretty significant improvements in in-stock over last year. Last year, we were quite low. So we see a really decent improvement in in-stock.  
And then specifically on your last question, probably around something just under $1 billion, around $1 billion would be what will we consider excess. That's down pretty significantly, about 1/3 of where we were at the end of Q2. So we're making improvements. Apparel and certain categories in GM are the heavy categories, and we'll continue to work through those.  
And just a reminder, we said at the beginning of Q1, we needed a couple of quarters to work through the inventory and we continue to do that. And then John David did mention in his commentary that there is room in our forecast to continue making progress on inventory.  
But I was in an import center last week, and the inbound is in really good shape. The orders are in line. So I think the team have done a really nice job adjusting to the end of the year."

Of course, there are a couple of pockets here and there that we'll continue to focus on as we go through Q4.

And I'm encouraged to see each market being in a good place going through to this holiday season."

That second category of nonreplenishable items, which are often features, we're managing that aggressively category by category and don't want to get too conservative. There are some places where we should still play offense through this quarter and into next year.  
And then lastly, I think it was appropriate for us the last couple of quarters to break out how much inventory we wish we didn't have. That number is getting down to the point where we probably won't be talking about that going forward, because we always have some inventory we don't want, even in a more normal circumstance.

First, I'd say the core business is continuing to perform pretty well in the face of a difficult macro environment.

The LIFO charge is a result of the inflationary environment that we're in, and it's heavily dependent upon what our inflation and inventory assumptions are next year. For planning purposes, we're basically assuming that prices stay where they are. The result on a year-over-year basis from an inflation perspective would be a little north of 3%, it's a little greater than 3%. And to the extent that, that changes, that affects that $1 billion estimate.

And we've been pretty open over the years that we don't necessarily manage private brand to a specific target, but what we do in private brand is develop great quality items and great values and then we are there for customers in whatever situation that they're in. And we've seen some customers this year trade into private brands more than they did in the previous year. That's not necessarily true of all customers. Customers shop differently, depending on the position that they're in. And one of the things John David said that's important is a large percentage, the majority of our share gains in the last quarter have come from high-end customers. 
So we want to be ready to serve customers with great quality, great value, private brand items. We also want to be able to serve customers well with premium items. And we definitely see that in channels like e-commerce and pickup."

And then secondly, on Sam's Club, I believe the company has driven close to 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp growth or close to 3 years. What do you attribute this continued and consistent growth to? And how should we be thinking about this momentum as we head into holiday and next year?

Yes, we saw a really strong quarter for international at 13%. Sales growth was encouraging. 
The real stories in here are that we are really starting to see the benefits of the diversification and portfolio work that we did over the last few years. That's led us to being able to focus where it matters across the International portfolio. And I'm definitely seeing the benefit of that as we look across the last couple of quarters of growth and profitability that we've seen. 
For the quarter specifically, maybe 2 markets to call out. We called out Flipkart, but to give you a little bit of color on that. The Big Billion Days event fell into Q3 for this year. It was in Q4 last year. That created some kind of differences in our results between Q3 and Q4, which we've called out. But that is an event which is designed to try to bring new customers onboard for Flipkart. And it looks to have been successful in doing that again. A billion visits over the 8 days of the event shows you the amount of traffic that, that generates and those customers shopping many of them for the first time. So Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and we've been pleased with the quarter. 
The other market I would call out is Mexico. So a really strong result from Mexico. They saw double-digit sales growth and strong profit growth as well. What's really encouraging there is not only their focus on their core business, but equally the focus that they're having on building up solutions for customers across their ecosystem. So their cash e-payment business that bites telecom business, the emerging health care businesses are all helping drive that customer connectivity back into the business. And they're proving to be a real powerhouse for the International segment. 
Across the other markets, maybe the only other market that I would highlight is China, which leads the way from an e-commerce perspective. So our e-commerce penetration for the quarter was 23%. But we also saw in China a 41% e-commerce penetration, and we're learning a lot from that market about how to deal with those kind of volumes, of deliveries and e-commerce as well in Sam's Club and is a real great format therefore in sharing much of the private brand and much of the innovation that Sam's Club in the U.S. is bringing through. 
I think it is that focus on the core business, making sure that our omnichannel capabilities around the world that are strong and also in looking at how we can make sure that we build out these ecosystems which are mutually reinforcing is what will help drive us for the future, too."

I think we have a pretty simple flywheel that's been sitting at the heart of driving the growth over the last 3 years. And it all starts with creating a member-obsessed culture. If you do that, you can't help but create items and services that members love. If you create items members love, you can buy deep and get cost advantages that you pass on to the member. 
And if you have great items at disruptive prices and you open up the channels of access like Judith talked about, then you can't help but drive membership income. And as we've driven that, we've been able to take some of the funds back and invest it in our associates who then help create this member-obsessed culture. And that is the flywheel that's just been fueling the 11 quarters of double-digit comp. 
I think as you kind of look at that, you can also see our membership income has been up kind of high single digits over the -- kind of over the 3-year period as well. And so it's really just reinforcing flywheel. 
If you think about Member's Mark, our Member's Mark item is actually made with and for our members. So we have 40,000 members who give us counsel on the items before we launch them to market, which means that they always launch successfully and we end up with about a 4.2 star rating minimum on our Member's Mark items. That's creating items that members love and they ensure that they're successful when they're launched. That's part of the magic that's sitting in that growth of 11 quarters."

And over the last few years, we've positioned the business to have a strong online pickup delivery business from stores, which includes an omnichannel approach, which enables customers to shop the entire business any way that they want to. 
In the last quarter specifically, I think there's been really good progress with a number of items that have come on to the Marketplace, including the number of sellers. The offering has grown pretty significantly just in the last quarter. The count of item's up about 50% which positions us well in categories like apparel as we look forward and also other strong categories like home. 
On the share point, I think the categories you mentioned, in one of our reports would show share gains and others, we feel pretty good about the overall market share remaining in a positive position through the quarter. 
So for the next 3 months, we're really focused on delivering and executing well for all of our customers. There will be a lot of holiday spending as people prepare for gifts. Doug mentioned earlier that our first annual event was basically in line with expectations. But there's a lot of daylight between now and the end of the quarter, still 75 days to go.

And then the second question is maybe to John David, the timing of LIFO. Is it -- a lot of companies experienced a lot of LIFO pressure during '22 because of how high inflation was. Why has it lagged? Is it because you lagged the pricing that [ let grow ] into your price? Is it other -- is there some other dynamic with LIFO that you had some reserves?

On 3Q, I think there's a couple of things that stand out in terms of the performance relative to our guidance. First is, as we talked about it in our prepared remarks, we gained share during the period, which in this time of high inflation that's putting pressure on the consumers, it shows that our value proposition is more relevant than ever. 
At the same time, there's also been an extreme focus on the expense side of the business. And so you see that we leveraged by almost 80 basis points in the quarter as we're continuing to focus on providing the best products to our customers but in the most efficient way that we can. And so those will be the 2 areas that I would call out that are most notable in terms of the outperformance. 
With respect to LIFO, what we've experienced this year with the over $200 million of LIFO charges has been entirely related to Sam's. Sam's uses the weighted average cost method for their inventory accounting. Walmart uses RAM, a retail inventory method. And so there's a slight nuance difference there that results in the lag. But our expectation, given that we think that these prices will persist, is that Walmart U.S. will then -- will soon begin incurring these charges as well. 
In terms of the timing of next year, it's more front-loaded than the back half of the year."

As it relates to customers shopping with us more frequently, this share gain with people making more than $100,000 household income is what I was referring to.

A lot of people may come to us for Tide or come to us for bananas, but they may not buy a T-shirt or a sweater. We've got really high market shares in some general merchandise categories which would tell you a lot of America shops at Walmart. 
And during a period of time when people are more sensitive to price, it makes sense that they would increase the amount of their wallet that would be coming to Walmart because of value. So that's what's happening. 
So that leads you to the second question, which is can you keep them? And I think some of the things John mentioned a minute ago, like pickup and delivery help. But as I mentioned in my remarks, fresh food and apparel are other areas, home's another one, where if we can stand tall during this period of time, we think they'll keep coming back to us because we do have quality, we do have value and we've created a lot more ways for them to save time in the store and we pick up in delivery.

And for a long time, we talked about the value of a store customer plus shopping on e-com, how much more valuable that was. We see that accelerate when it's pickup, e-commerce and stores. So going forward, you'll hear us talk about this more and more as an omni offer which is really flexible for the customer and doing things like having options for Thanksgiving meal that are priced the same as last year are really helpful at a time when customers are feeling the pressure of inflation. 
And then the last thing, regionally, no real differences to report in the third quarter across the geographies. We saw strength in many geographies.

At the start of your prepared remarks, Doug, you mentioned that you're aiming to bring down prices for consumers. As we move into next year, it's likely that some of the pressures that caused all the inflation in consumer goods will start to recede. How is Walmart going to handle that? Could you actually see prices come down? And that's important given that Walmart tends to be the price-setter across a lot of consumer goods, and you're going to have this growing pool of alternative profit from what you can actually support lower prices into next year. 
And then my follow-up question is for John David. John David, you provided a couple of [ least ] parameters for how to think about 2023 between the $1 billion LIFO headwind to gross margin and the $3 billion of FX drag to sales next year. Does that mean we should expect that 2023 is going to be a sub algo year for Walmart of achieving 4% top line growth and 4.5% operating income growth? And then you'll get that back in 2024 and some of those headwinds we see such that the combination of those 2 years should produce the algorithm."

The algorithm is the first thing that came to mind when you asked the question about how we'll approach prices. The 4% and greater than 4% numbers are certainly on our mind, and that indicates that we think we can grow the operating income percentage of the company over time. 
As we navigate next year, that will be one factor that we're thinking about. Obviously, we'll be thinking about customers and members as well and driving top line and growing share. So we'll be navigating it basically week to week, month to month as things change. And commodities like protein categories have already started to respond. They move quickly based on demand, there'll be volatility in categories like fresh food. The general merchandise categories have started to move as demand softens. 
And things like transportation cost change. We've seen some downward movement in general merchandise. And I think that will continue, trying to guess, in the next year to some degree. And we'll manage margins in a price gap in general merchandise department by department, category by category as we always do, but have an eye towards leading down while protecting profitability as much as we can. 
I think dry grocery and consumables will be more stubborn. Wage rates have gone up, and that won't change. And some input costs have been high for those categories. That's the area where we need to partner even more with our suppliers and come up with more creative solutions and try to do the best we can of relieving that pressure for customers and members. 
When you add it all up, we'll watch our price gaps. We like where our price gaps are. As you've heard us say many times, we understand where price gaps need to be to drive our sales. And then we manage the rest of the pieces to consider operating income and return on investment."

What we've seen really for the last 3 years up until Q1 of this year was a flat private brand penetration, not much movement in '19, '20, '21. And then the movement, the trading to private brands from other brands really started in about March of this year. And then as we said in the quarter, it's increased its penetration in the food categories by about 130 basis points. So a relatively decent amount has moved into private brands. 
As far as comparisons to prior periods, I think the last time we would be able to say anything about this is probably 12 to 13 years ago. So I don't think I have anything today to offer with specificity other than what we've seen in the last 3 quarters is quite a bit of switching amongst some consumers. Now there are other consumers that are trading to Walmart that are not trading in private brands. They're branded customers and they're buying more premium items. 
So again, I would just repeat the fact that we positioned ourselves in terms of merchandising in the portfolio and with the channels by which we serve customers in a very flexible way so that we can help customers in whatever economic situation they're in and we'll be ready for the rest of the year."

There, Peter, a group of items that make up kind of the scratch cooking aspects of Thanksgiving, 25 items for $88, the same as last year, that's one basket. We've looked at Thanksgiving baskets in different ways and taken other actions on products that are more convenient, not scratched, like our $71 for 17 different items. That alleviates the need to switch. These are -- some of these are branded items. I think that's a great example of how we can step up and absorb some of this to help families that need it most.

I'll start and others can jump in. This is John David. Look, one of the biggest impacts in our business this year has been the change in mix, particularly as we think about the U.S. business, where the margin profile is different on general merchandise versus food and consumables. We don't have an assumption that, that bounces back rapidly next year. And with continued high prices, the consumer continuing to be pressured, we expect to have that mix effect effects prolong into next year. 
So I know there's hope that things would bounce back. And certainly, some of the onetime costs that we've incurred this year related to supply chain are not going to repeat next year, but the consumer is stressed. One of the things that's assisted that thus far is relatively strong balance sheets among consumers assisted by stimulus payments. That's not going to last forever. So that's why we take a rather cautious view on the consumer. 
But at the same time, as all of us have mentioned, this is when our value proposition really shines, when customers are looking for value. And it's not just value, it's also product assortment. One of the things that John mentioned, and I think it's worth repeating, but it's not just the 370 million SKUs that we're offering between first-party and third-party e-commerce, it's the acceleration of that. That's a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter. And it shows you that not only are we providing products at the price point that customers want, we're providing additional products and assortment for them to buy."

First, we have to focus on what we can control in any environment. And that would consist of great merchants; positioning our sales for value, which is relative value and taking a longer-term approach to the consumer; and then finally, strong execution. 
We've made some progress with inventory, as we said, quarter-to-quarter, from high 20s to just over 12% over the last year. So having an inventory position that's strong going into the year with some flexibility is a really important part to be able to maneuver any environment that we get into. So we'll continue to focus on those 3, and we'll be ready for customers in any scenario that we find ourselves in, in the next couple of years."

We're excited about Thanksgiving next week because of the way we prepared in the food business. And then we have an event in December that we're looking forward to as well. 
The customers that are trading into the brand, as I said earlier, it's a mix, which is great. We're seeing more customers more often. We're seeing them in more categories. Historically, in the last quarter, we do see a lot of new customers who come in via food and consumables. And then through the digital experience, what we did over the last really 12 months was integrate the original Walmart grocery shopping app and the Walmart.com app into one place. So the entire assortment, up to 350-plus million items, are all there in 1 place. So I think we're positioned well to be able to navigate. 
As far as promotions, as we said earlier, the guidance would include the ability to react to a more promotional environment, but we don't know yet. It's still mid-November, and there's a lot of room between now and the end of the holidays, including New Year. So again, we'll be prepared for any environment that emerges over the next few weeks."

I think there's a lot to look at in the metrics that we shared, we've shared a lot of information this morning, that would indicate not only are kind of the key short-term operational metrics being managed well, but we are building a different business model. John David talked a bit about that in his prepared remarks. We're excited to see progress in terms of how Marketplace is scaling and how these businesses connect to each other. 
So we're not just focused on the short term, but we are focused on the short term as we build for the long term. The key issue has been inventory management, and I'm really thankful to have a team with a lot of experience and able to consume a lot of data to make good choices about where we position inventory by country, by category, for the rest of this quarter and into next year. I'm sure there will be some things that surprise us, but we are engineered for flexibility. 
And as I mentioned in my remarks, one of the things I love about this business, there's a long list of things I love, but one of the things I love are all the natural hedges. If they don't want to buy something, we'll sell them something else. If the price needs to be a little lower, we'll figure that out. If a problem needs to be dealt with, we'll deal with it, and there'll be something else going well that helps us manage the total portfolio. That's the way that I think about it.
