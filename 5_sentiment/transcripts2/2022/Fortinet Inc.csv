Global G20",447,"Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. 
For the fourth quarter, bookings increased 49% to $1.420 billion. Billings increased 36% to $1.306 billion. Global G2000 buildings growth accelerated to over 90%. Q1 billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth 29% to $964 million, with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results. 
For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin 90%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. 3 growth drivers, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with a security fabry match platform and an elevated threat environment are driving our strong financial results and market share gains. 
The move to warfare has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditionally security from hard to protect. Fortinet security-driven networking approach converged networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G, DNA and OT to reduce capacity, while securing and connecting remote user to advance security and performance and a networking speed. 
Enterprise evolutions are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity match approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity match architecture that provide broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment. 
Today, we announced a FortiGate 2000, the latest FortiGate next changing firewall, powered by Fortinet basic NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core network. The FortiGate 2009 secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings. 
Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors into a critical capability for network firewall. We evaluated the performance across noncritical capability. Fortinet FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use case and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the only leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN. 
Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into 202 of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly position us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth. 
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and we especially like to send our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet fast growth. Keith?"

I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance. Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 ke",776,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance. 
Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key demand drivers that Ken mentioned, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform and the elevated threat environment. 
Convergence or security-driven networking requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across the company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, WiFi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered for gates can be 5 to 10x more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products. 
Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue. 
And turning to our 2021 performance. Billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in 6 years. Revenue growth also accelerated coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years. 
Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion. 
Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry. Our GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years. 
Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%. And when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. 
Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue. 
Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, Backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. 
While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong, it should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a, say, a low single-digit percentage of backlog. 
Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system are not commodities really changed with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and for the most employed security network solution over 1/3 of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer from any suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match. And I apologize for the sound in the background, we don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on. 
Moving to Q4 billings of $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings in noted earlier. Enterprises favorites Fortinet's leading cost performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. Add more color to this, we could share, global 2000 buildings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100 deal threshold for the first time in our history. 
We saw a record of 4 low 8-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly..."

And lastly, our price for performance advantage can be difficult for our competition to match. 
Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprise favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. 
The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of 4 low figure -8-figure transactions, all in the Americas in the quarter. 
And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26%, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings. 
As shown on Slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted growth rates. 
Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months. 
For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government buildings grab the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings on billings growth of 63%. Billings and manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets. 
Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60s. 
Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue. 
Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin. 
Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195. 
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of $541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of $742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023. 
Inventory turns of 2.7 were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9x in the prior quarter. Overall, with what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by a strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge. 
The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary Hasek FortiGates, are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains. 
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter summarized on Slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog, an increase in backlog as a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins. 
For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. 
We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. 
Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. 
In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by 2 or 3 points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%. 
Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27%; non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million. 
Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter."

End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order bookings. 
For us, booking as a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment throughout if we -- so that counts the booking. And if we ship it, then it's becomes a building and it becomes product revenue. And if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that was, sorry. 
So in terms of supply chain and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that. I do -- we talked previously, I think that we felt that September, October and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low watermark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, is shown to be the case. 
We do still from time to time, have the commitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether there's components here as contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there be some improvement in auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward. 
At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the capital or engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken?"

I think is different compared to most of our competitors, we handle the design, manufacture operation, put them make directly ourselves. And also we have a bigger quantity compare our competitors can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to award a certain shortage of the component, which are working well with us, but some of take about 6 months. 
I think overall, that's what we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving both because the supply and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say last quarter, the demand in very very strong, with booking grew 49% which even kind of beyond -- kind of planning. So that's caused some of the shortage. 
But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply. 
And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel in the distributor there pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to up the product. So that's not the case for us."

We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just a follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel.

And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics?"

How many questions will account as one? I start with the easy one first pricing. We raised prices, we've talked about before prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services. 
But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services you're going to recognize that over time. 
And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you? As you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. 
And so backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up."

So the network security deploy pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border. 
So we deployed internally at a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewalls needed to do the internal segmentation, security server, segment, different department, all these kind of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand in growth with the current environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the security SD-WANs and 5G and other also see very strong demand. So that's what we see. 
We're leading innovation in both space with our own ASIC with all the secure SD-WAN 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's where we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next 3, 4 years.

I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that, that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to kind of move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out. And then the mid enterprise, the enterprise. And then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products. 
And I think that why that's relevant is that's the affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will. 
I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent not in the top 5, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution. not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost.

And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall convergence of repeating in the network or security, that's the 3 driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith mentioned, May 10. So we'll probably give some more details on data some analysis we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long term changing in the whole space we were keeping growth in the next 5 to 10 years. and also ASIC advantage and the continental scale and scope all starting working for us because we have the quantity which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have. 
And also, we're probably the only company design own ASIC chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including the whatever Intel, MV, GPU, TPU,IPU or the other things we're using, but we have unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in drive over high-speed, low-cost network security solution. 
On the other side, the economy of scope also working because we have like a set some different product harbor we call the fabric and now on cash match that basically mesh architecture. -- is helping offset I think last quarter is the first time the over over 30%. I think right now, it's a FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 41% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very strong growth, growth faster than the FortiGate.

And Q1 billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth 29% to $964 million, with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through our challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results.
For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. 3 growth drivers, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with a Security Fabric match platform and an elevated threat environment are driving our strong financial results and market share gains.
The move to warfare has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditionally network security from hard to protect. Fortinet security-driven networking approach converged networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G, DNA and OT to reduce capacity, while securing and connecting remote user to advance security and performance and a networking speed. 
Enterprise evolutions are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity match approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity match architecture that provide broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment.
Today, we announced a FortiGate 2000 app, the latest FortiGate next-generation firewall, powered by Fortinet ASIC NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core network. The FortiGate 2000 app secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings.
Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors into a critical capability for network firewall. We evaluated for their performance across noncritical capability. Fortinet FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use case and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the only leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN.
Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly position us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and we especially like to thank our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet fast growth. Keith?"

I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key",778,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.
Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key demand drivers that Ken mentioned, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric match platform and the elevated threat environment.
Convergence or security-driven networking requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across the company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, Wi-Fi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered FortiGates can be 5 to 10x more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products.
Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue.
And turning to our 2021 performance. Billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in 6 years. Revenue growth also accelerated coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years.
Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion.
Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry. Our mirror GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years.
Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%. And when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. 
Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue.
Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services.
While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong, it should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a, say, a low single-digit percentage of backlog.
Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and for the most employed security network solution over 1/3 of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer from any suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match. And I apologize for the sound in the background, we don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on.
Moving to Q4 billings of $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprises favorites Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. To add more color to this, we could share, Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-deal threshold for the first time in our history.
We saw a record of 4 low 8-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly..."

So -- and I believe that was around when I was mentioning that we were breaking down our backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to product",1448,"I'll back up a couple of paragraphs to my best recollection of where the challenge started. So -- and I believe that was around when I was mentioning that we were breaking down our backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to product -- future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind for growth later this year and into next year.
Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and is the most deployed network security solution with over 1/3 of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage can be difficult for our competition to match.
Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprise favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.
The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of 4 low figure -8-figure transactions, all in the Americas in the quarter.
And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26%, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings.
As shown on Slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple-digit growth rates.
Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months.
For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government billings grab the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings, on billings growth of 63%. Billings and manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets.
Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60s.
Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $629 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue.
Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin.
Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195.
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of $541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of $742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023.
Inventory turns of 2.7 were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9x in the prior quarter. Overall, with what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by a strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge.
The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary ASIC FortiGates, are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains.
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter summarized on Slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog, an increase in backlog is a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins.
For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between 166 million and 168 million. 
We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.
Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics.
In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by 2 or 3 points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%. 
Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27%; non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between 169 million and 171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million.
Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter."

And then maybe any other incremental color you can provide us on the supply chain management? How you're managing the supply chain? You mentioned pricing increases offsetting an incremental supplier cost. But maybe a view on are the issues abating at all? Are lead times still consistent with where they were last quarter?

End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order bookings.
For us, a booking is a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment throughout if we -- so that counts as a booking. And if we ship it, then it becomes a billing and it becomes product revenue. And if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause it, sorry. 
So in terms of supply chain and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that. I do -- we talked previously, I think that we felt that September, October and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low watermark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, is shown to be the case.
We do still from time to time, have decommitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether it's components or it's contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there be some improvement in auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward.
At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the capital or engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken?"
2689126,1763155933,2484894,"Fortinet, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Fortinet, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I think you covered all of it.

I think it is different compared to most of our competitors, we handle the design, manufacture operation, put them make directly ourselves. And also, we have a bigger quantity compare our competitors can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to award a certain shortage of the component, which are working well with us, but some of the redesign may take about 6 months. 
I think overall, that's what we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say last quarter, the demand is very very strong, with booking growth of 49% which even kind of beyond all kind of planning. So that's caused some of the shortage.
But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply.
And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel in the distributor there pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel step up the product. So that's not the case for us."

And the best number we can come up with is something that represents extremely low single digits of our business may have been impacted by that. 
And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just a follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel. And that inventory -- those inventory levels are actually down a little bit year-over-year. So I don't think we're seeing the types of things that maybe you may have some concerns about."

Can you talk us through how that is dovetailing into your guidance for next year? 
And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize into your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics?"

How many questions are accounted as one? I'll start with the easy one first, pricing. We raised prices, we've talked about before prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services.
But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services you're going to recognize that over time.
And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you? As you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. 
And so backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up."

And so they say their newest product, probably like 20% faster than Fortinet product 1800 app, but that's the product we released more than 2 years ago. I think based on Moore's law, so every 2 year -- every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product is already much faster now. So I do see because the -- we see secure-driven networking conversion of network and security. So the network security that we deploy pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border.
So when deployed internally at a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewall is needed to do the internal segmentation, security the server, segment different department, all these kinds of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand in growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to call remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the secure SD-WANs and 5Gs and other also see very strong demand. So that's what we see.
We're leading innovation in both space with our own ASIC with all the secure SD-WAN and 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's where we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next 3, 4 years. It's a huge potential and market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share."

I think I can narrate for you. Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that, that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to kind of move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out. And then the mid enterprise, the enterprise. And then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products.
And I think that why that's relevant is that's the affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will.
I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent not in the top 5 but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost. So I do think there's definitely a tailwind in that area."

And also internally, they need to secure the whole infrastructure both in the -- within the like campus network data center or remote in connecting branch office. So that's where we see the whole infrastructure need to be secured. And also kind of consolidation among different vendors also starting to happen more quickly because like Keith mentioned, the management cost is very high, if they have a different vendor for different part of cybersecurity. 
So that's where the vendor can provide more products integrate, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower the total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the 3-driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor and at the same time, the strong elevated cybersecurity threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the business is all driving the strong growth."

I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith you mentioned, May 10. So we'll probably give some more details on data, some analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space, we were keeping growth in the next 5 to 10 years. And also ASIC advantage and the continental scale and scope all started working for us because we have the quantity which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have.
And also, we're probably the only cybersecurity company design own ASIC chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including the whatever Intel, MV, GPU, TPU, IPU or the other things we're using, but we have unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in drive over high-speed, low-cost network security solution. 
On the other side, the economy of scope also working because we have like some different product harbor, we call the fabric and now kind of call the mesh, cybersecurity mesh architecture, which is helping upsell, cross-sell I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's a FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 41% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very strong growth, growth faster than the FortiGate. So that's also helping to supporting the whole infrastructure security converging on network and security and also elevate the threat environment."

Early in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, is more stable, it may have been easier to identify or refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last 5 years. And I think that's perhaps going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place, and its lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean, 5 years ago, a lot of things that were airgap away from the Internet aren't anymore.
And now you see it's probably what's probably what's driving the manufacturing vertical for us. I just -- I don't know that you can presume that the environment, so to speak, and the political interest in it, the insurance company's interest in it, CIOs management team's interest in it. It is a hot topic of conversation. So even if you are due for a refresh cycle in the industry, and I don't know that we are, I don't think you're going to see that because of what's happening in the world out there."

For the fourth quarter, bookings increased 49% to $1.420 billion. Billings increased 36% to $1.306 billion. Global G2000 billings growth accelerated to over 90%. Secure SD-WAN billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth 29% to $964 million, with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results.
For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin was 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Three growth drivers -- convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with our Security Fabric mesh platform, and an elevated threat environment -- are driving our strong financial results and market share gains.
The move to work-from-anywhere has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditional network security found hard to protect. Fortinet's security-driven networking approach converges networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G, [ DTLE ] and OT to reduce complexity, while securing and connecting remote users to advanced security and performance and networking speed. 
Enterprise evolutions are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity mesh approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity mesh architecture that provides broad, integrated and automated protection across multiple edges, from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment.
Today, we announced a FortiGate 3000F, the latest FortiGate next-generation firewall, powered by Fortinet ASIC NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core networks. The FortiGate 3000F secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings.
Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors in Gartner's Critical Capabilities for network firewalls. Evaluated for their performance across 9 critical capabilities, Fortinet's FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use cases, and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the [ only ] leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN.
Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly positions us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and would especially like to thank our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet's fast growth. Keith?"
2689126,1763155933,2491241,"Fortinet, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Fortinet, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key",776,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.
Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key demand drivers that Ken mentioned: convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform, and the elevated threat environment.
Convergence, or security-driven networking, requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across a company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds, as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, Wi-Fi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered FortiGates can be 5x to 10x more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products.
Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue.
And turning to our 2021 performance. Billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in 6 years. Revenue growth also accelerated, coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years.
Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion.
Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry, [indiscernible] GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years.
Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%, and when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. 
Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue.
Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services.
While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a say -- a low single-digit percentage of backlog.
Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain, and for the most employed security network solution, over 1/3 of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price-for-performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match.
And I apologize for the sound in the background. We don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on.
Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprises favors Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. To add more color to this, we could share Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-deal threshold for the first time in our history.
We saw a record of 4 low 8-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly..."

Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprises favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.
The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of 4 low figure-8 -- 8-figure transactions, all in the Americas, in the quarter.
And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings.
As shown on Slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple-digit growth rates.
Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months.
For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings, on billings growth of 63%. Billings in manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets.
Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60%s.
Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate product and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue.
Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin.
Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195.
Moving to the statement of cash flow, summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of $541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of $742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023.
Inventory turns of 2.7x were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9x in the prior quarter. Overall, with what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge.
The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary ASIC FortiGates are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains.
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter, summarized on Slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog. An increase in backlog is a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins.
For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between 166 million and 168 million. 
We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.
Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics.
In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by 2 or 3 points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%; revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%.  
Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27%; non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between 169 million and 171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million.
Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this -- we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter."

And I guess maybe on that point, maybe could you help us understand what qualifies as a booking from a timing perspective? If an order is placed with a timing event maybe 9 months from now, is that still included in bookings?
And then maybe any other incremental color you can provide us on the supply chain management? How you're managing the supply chain? You mentioned pricing increases offsetting an incremental supplier cost. But maybe a view on are the issues abating at all? Are lead times still consistent with where they were last quarter?

End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large, complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order -- what a booking is.
For us, a booking is a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment. If we -- so that counts as a booking. And if we ship it, then it becomes a billing and it becomes product revenue, and if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that, sorry. 
So in terms of supply chain, and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that, I do -- we talked previously, I think, that we felt that September, October, and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low-water mark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, has shown to be the case.
We do still, from time to time, have decommitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether it's components or it's contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there seems be some improvement, and auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward.
At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the cap to our engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken?"

I think it's just different compared to most of our competitors; we handle the design/manufacture operation pretty much all directly ourselves. And also, we have a bigger quantity compared to our competitors. We can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering, also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to avoid a certain shortage of the components, which are working well with us, but some of the redesign may take about 6 months. 
I think overall, that's why we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving, both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say, last quarter the demand was very, very strong with booking growth of 49%, which even kind of beyond all kind of our planning. So that's caused some of the shortage.
But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply.
And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel, in the distributor there, pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to step up the product. So that's not the case for us."

And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just to follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel.

So between the 49% growth you saw in bookings, 36% billings growth that you saw this quarter and the 31% in product, can you talk us through how that is dovetailing into your guidance for next year? 
And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize into your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics?"

How many questions are counted as one here? I'll start with the easy one first, pricing. We raised prices, we've talked before about we raised prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services.
But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services; you're going to recognize that over time.
And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you, as you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. 
And so if backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up."

I think based on Moore's law, so every 2 year -- every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product is much faster now. So I do see, because the -- we see secure-driven networking converging of network and security. So the network security [indiscernible] deployed pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border.
So when deployed internally needs a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewall is needed, to do the internal segmentation, secure the server, segment different departments, all these kinds of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand and very strong growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to call in remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the secure SD-WANs and 5Gs and other also see very strong demand. So that's what we see.
We're leading innovation in both spaces with our own ASIC, with all the secure SD-WAN and 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's what we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next 3, 4 years. It's a huge potential and a market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share."

Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to kind of move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out, and then the mid-enterprise, the enterprise, and then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products.
And I think that why that's relevant is that's affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will.
I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent, not in the top 5, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us, in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well, that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution, not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost.

So that's where the vendor can provide more products integrated, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower the total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the 3 driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor, and at the same time, the strong elevated cybersecurity threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the businesses, is all driving the strong growth."

And so it's more than Check Point that's experiencing demand and it's more than the what I characterize as the consolidation when you're taking share from the likes of Cisco in SD-WAN.
And so I'm trying to understand, if you thought about the aggregate demand is -- in the last 3 quarters has been far exceeded anything that's happened in, say, the last 5 years between not only yourself, but your 3 primary competitors ex Cisco. And so the question is, if traffic is normally one of the key drivers, but what are some other drivers for not just yourself, but for the 3 primary vendors?

And then also like we see very, very strong demand to secure inside the company and also like all this data center, all this internal segmentation, which is, before, the network security is too slow to deploy in the high-speed environment internally. 
And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall is the convergence of -- repeating saying -- the network, network security, that's the 3 driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith, you mentioned May 10, so we'll probably give some more details, some data, some analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space, where we're keeping growth in the next 5 to 10 years. And also our ASIC advantage and the [ continental ] scale and scope all started working for us, because we have the quantity which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have.
And also, we're probably the only cybersecurity company to design own ASIC chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including all the -- whatever, Intel, Nvidia, GPU, TPU, IPU or the other things we're using, but we have the unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in driving of our high-speed, low-cost network security solution. 
On the other side, the economy of scope also working, because we have like some different product harbor, we called the fabric and now going to call the mesh, cybersecurity mesh architecture, which is helping upsell, cross-sell. I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 31% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very strong growth, growth faster than the FortiGate.

Shameless on Peter for continuing to plug the Analyst Day.
Earlier in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, was more stable, it may have been easier to identify refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last 5 years. And I think that's perhaps, going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place, and it's lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean 5 years ago a lot of things that were air gapped away from the Internet aren't anymore.

Secure SD-WAN billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth 29% to $964 million, with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results.
For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin was 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Three growth drivers -- convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with our Security Fabric mesh platform, and an elevated threat environment -- are driving our strong financial results and market share gains.
The move to work-from-anywhere has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditional network security found hard to protect. Fortinet's security-driven networking approach converges networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G, [ DTLE ] and OT to reduce complexity, while securing and connecting remote users to advanced security and performance and networking speed. 
Enterprise evolutions are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity mesh approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity mesh architecture that provides broad, integrated and automated protection across multiple edges, from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment.
Today, we announced a FortiGate 3000F, the latest FortiGate next-generation firewall, powered by Fortinet ASIC NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core networks. The FortiGate 3000F secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings.
Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors in Gartner's Critical Capabilities for network firewalls. Evaluated for their performance across 9 critical capabilities, Fortinet's FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use cases, and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the [ only ] leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN.
Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly positions us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and would especially like to thank our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet's fast growth. Keith?"

I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key",776,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance.
Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the 3 key demand drivers that Ken mentioned: convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform, and the elevated threat environment.
Convergence, or security-driven networking, requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across a company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds, as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, Wi-Fi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered FortiGates can be 5x to 10x more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products.
Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue.
And turning to our 2021 performance. Billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in 6 years. Revenue growth also accelerated, coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years.
Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion.
Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry, [indiscernible] GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years.
Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%, and when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. 
Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue.
Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services.
While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a say -- a low single-digit percentage of backlog.
Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain, and for the most employed security network solution, over 1/3 of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price-for-performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match.
And I apologize for the sound in the background. We don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on.
Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprises favors Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. To add more color to this, we could share Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-deal threshold for the first time in our history.
We saw a record of 4 low 8-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly..."

Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprises favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.
The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of 4 low figure-8 -- 8-figure transactions, all in the Americas, in the quarter.
And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings.
As shown on Slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple-digit growth rates.
Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months.
For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings, on billings growth of 63%. Billings in manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets.
Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60%s.
Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate product and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue.
Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin.
Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195.
Moving to the statement of cash flow, summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of $541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of $742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023.
Inventory turns of 2.7x were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9x in the prior quarter. Overall, with what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge.
The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary ASIC FortiGates are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains.
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter, summarized on Slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog. An increase in backlog is a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins.
For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between 166 million and 168 million. 
We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.
Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics.
In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by 2 or 3 points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%; revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%.  
Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27%; non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between 169 million and 171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million.
Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this -- we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter."

End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large, complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order -- what a booking is.
For us, a booking is a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment. If we -- so that counts as a booking. And if we ship it, then it becomes a billing and it becomes product revenue, and if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that, sorry. 
So in terms of supply chain, and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that, I do -- we talked previously, I think, that we felt that September, October, and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low-water mark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, has shown to be the case.
We do still, from time to time, have decommitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether it's components or it's contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there seems be some improvement, and auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward.
At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the cap to our engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken?"

I think it's just different compared to most of our competitors; we handle the design/manufacture operation pretty much all directly ourselves. And also, we have a bigger quantity compared to our competitors. We can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering, also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to avoid a certain shortage of the components, which are working well with us, but some of the redesign may take about 6 months. 
I think overall, that's why we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving, both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say, last quarter the demand was very, very strong with booking growth of 49%, which even kind of beyond all kind of our planning. So that's caused some of the shortage.
But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply.
And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel, in the distributor there, pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to step up the product. So that's not the case for us."

And the best number we can come up with is something that represents extremely low single digits of our business may have been impacted by that. 
And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just to follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel. And that inventory -- those inventory levels are actually down a little bit year-over-year. So I don't think we're seeing the types of things that maybe you may have some concerns about."

At the risk of oversimplification, I know you've given us the bookings growth, you've given us the billings growth, and certainly the product growth and the guidance for fiscal '22. So between the 49% growth you saw in bookings, 36% billings growth that you saw this quarter and the 31% in product, can you talk us through how that is dovetailing into your guidance for next year? 
And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize into your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics?"

How many questions are counted as one here? I'll start with the easy one first, pricing. We raised prices, we've talked before about we raised prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services.
But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services; you're going to recognize that over time.
And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you, as you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. 
And so if backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up."

And I also mentioned to Check Point earnings this morning. I probably sent a deal we mentioned Fortinet. And so they say their newest product probably like 20% faster than Fortinet product 1800F, but that's the product we released more than 2 years ago. I think based on Moore's law, so every 2 year -- every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product is much faster now. So I do see, because the -- we see secure-driven networking converging of network and security. So the network security [indiscernible] deployed pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border.
So when deployed internally needs a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewall is needed, to do the internal segmentation, secure the server, segment different departments, all these kinds of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand and very strong growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to call in remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the secure SD-WANs and 5Gs and other also see very strong demand. So that's what we see.
We're leading innovation in both spaces with our own ASIC, with all the secure SD-WAN and 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's what we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next 3, 4 years. It's a huge potential and a market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share."

Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to kind of move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out, and then the mid-enterprise, the enterprise, and then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products.
And I think that why that's relevant is that's affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will.
I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent, not in the top 5, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us, in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well, that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution, not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost. So I do think there's definitely a tailwind in that area."

And also internally, they need to secure the whole infrastructure, both in the -- within the like campus network data center or remote internet in the branch office. So that's where we see the whole infrastructure need to be secured. And also kind of consolidation among different vendors also starting to happen more quickly because, like Keith mentioned, the management cost is very high, if they have a different vendor for different parts of cybersecurity. 
So that's where the vendor can provide more products integrated, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower the total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the 3 driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor, and at the same time, the strong elevated cybersecurity threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the businesses, is all driving the strong growth."

We've had some people in other settings comment upon the maturity that the sales and marketing execution level has reached now as a company. So I think that the pipeline and our ability to execute, I don't see why that would change."

It's a much bigger market. And at the same time, there's a lot of innovation going on and have to secure the whole infrastructure. So that's where we see the appliances also.

And so it's more than Check Point that's experiencing demand and it's more than the what I characterize as the consolidation when you're taking share from the likes of Cisco in SD-WAN.
And so I'm trying to understand, if you thought about the aggregate demand is -- in the last 3 quarters has been far exceeded anything that's happened in, say, the last 5 years between not only yourself, but your 3 primary competitors ex Cisco. And so the question is, if traffic is normally one of the key drivers, but what are some other drivers for not just yourself, but for the 3 primary vendors?

And then also like we see very, very strong demand to secure inside the company and also like all this data center, all this internal segmentation, which is, before, the network security is too slow to deploy in the high-speed environment internally. 
And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall is the convergence of -- repeating saying -- the network, network security, that's the 3 driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith, you mentioned May 10, so we'll probably give some more details, some data, some analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space, where we're keeping growth in the next 5 to 10 years. And also our ASIC advantage and the [ continental ] scale and scope all started working for us, because we have the quantity which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have.
And also, we're probably the only cybersecurity company to design own ASIC chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including all the -- whatever, Intel, Nvidia, GPU, TPU, IPU or the other things we're using, but we have the unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in driving of our high-speed, low-cost network security solution. 
On the other side, the economy of scope also working, because we have like some different product harbor, we called the fabric and now going to call the mesh, cybersecurity mesh architecture, which is helping upsell, cross-sell. I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 31% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very strong growth, growth faster than the FortiGate. So that's also helping to supporting the whole infrastructure security and converging of network and security and also elevated threat environment."

Shame on Peter for continuing to plug the Analyst Day.
Earlier in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, was more stable, it may have been easier to identify refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last 5 years. And I think that's perhaps, going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place, and it's lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean 5 years ago a lot of things that were air gapped away from the Internet aren't anymore.
And now you see it's probably what's probably what's driving the manufacturing vertical for us. I just -- I don't know that you can presume that the environment, so to speak, and the political interest in it, the insurance companies' interest in it, CIOs management team's interest in it.

Our better-than-expected first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand of our cybersecurity innovation. Total revenue growth of 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Total billings increased 36%. Our strong results reflect new order that was significantly greater than anticipated, partially offset by an increase in backlog. As a result, bookings increased 50% year-over-year to 1,276 billion, which included booking growth for SD-WAN or 54%, Global 2000 growth of 61%, OT growth of 76%.
For the quarter, net new backlog was 9% of bookings as we continue to navigate a challenging supply chain environment. We believe that the hybrid network adhere for foreseeable future, and Fortinet is pushing the boundary of what is possible with innovation to enable customers to successfully operate in today's elevated threat environment. Our solid performance and market share gains are being driven by our effort to make our customers our entire infrastructure more secure and integrate in a zero trust network.
Footing as secure-driven network approach converged networking functionality with security capability fueled by our powerful for ASIC SPU to provide the best performance and rich functionality. The new FortiOS 7.2 offers multiple new and enhanced service across FortiGuard, FortiCare and FortiTrust such as VPNA identity, demand unboxing, advanced device protection for OT and IoT environment, associated service and in-line capacity. And Fortinet provides one of the broadest security service offering and an average of half the cost compared to our main competitors.
In addition, we have prioritized our most organic research and development efforts on integrating security product into our centralized FortiOS [indiscernible] platform, which [indiscernible] refer to as a cybersecurity mesh architecture.
Today, we announced a new suite of FortiGate powered by our food ASIC SPU, the FortiGate 3700-F,600-F and 700-F deliver high-performance converged networking and security, with security computer reaching of 5x on average better performance than competitive offerings.
During the quarter, we are pleased to review -- to receive the Garnier Inside Customer Choice Award for both 1H infrastructure and next-generation firewall for 3 years in a row. Our innovation position Fortinet as one of the most influential cyber security leaders. These growth drivers and organic innovation is accelerating our growth potential to new level.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. It is their collective effort and a trust that will contribute into Fortinet's strong growth and market share gains."

Before adding to Ken's comments and going into more detail on our Q1 financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss a wording change in how we describe our business. FortiGate is now referred to as the core pl",1759,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before adding to Ken's comments and going into more detail on our Q1 financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss a wording change in how we describe our business. FortiGate is now referred to as the core platform and non-FortiGate is now referred to as the platform extension. This change helps to emphasize the importance of our FortiOS operating system. FortiOS drives our entire security platform across multiple platform extension use cases, including Zero Trust access, cloud security, security operations and secure networking. With that in mind, let's start with a more detailed Q1 discussion.
Customer demand was again strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting 3 key demand drivers, the elevated threat environment, convergence of security and networking and customers consolidating across our platform offerings. These key growth drivers are contributing to our strong results and accelerating pipeline growth. In short, we believe we're in a period of sustained high growth for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet.
Moving to the Q1 financial results. Total revenue of $955 million, was up 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Taking into account an $80 million, sequential increase in product backlog. Product bookings growth was 87%. Product revenue growth was -- broad based with core platform and platform extension product revenue growth at 50% and 59%, respectively.
While we continue to see robust product growth from our SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT, the core platform product revenue growth was mainly driven by the wide range of other use cases embedded in our operating system.
Service revenue was up 24% to $584 million. Support and related services was up 26% to $271 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 23% to $313 million. To offer one observation about how customers may be responding to the supply chain challenges, we are seeing indications that a subset of customers place product orders further in advance, and may have delayed purchases or registrations of the related service contracts. This, together with the timing differences with age product and service revenue recognition, creates a lag between product and service revenue growth rates. We expect quarterly service revenue growth to accelerate throughout the rest of the year.
As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 32%. EMEA revenue increased 25%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 57%, which includes the contribution from ALAXALA. EMEA's growth includes the impact of suspending operations in Russia. Nonetheless, EMEA easily exceeded their internal targets. Looking forward, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our EMEA business, despite the situation in Eastern Europe and its potential impact on European economies. Platform extension revenue grew 49% and accounted for 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points.
Moving to bookings, backlog and billings. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that continues to exceed supply by more than historical norms. Bookings were up 50% to $1.3 billion, reflecting exceptional demand and a $116 million quarter-over-quarter increase in total backlog, bringing backlog to $278 million.
Larger enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's industry-leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform strategy. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products.
The following key metrics illustrate growing demand from enterprise customers. Global 2000 bookings were up over 60%. Large enterprise bookings were up over 65%.  Secure SD-WAN bookings grew 54%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong economic case. OT bookings were up 76%, illustrating the continued response to the elevated threat environment.
As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. However, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top line tailwind in future quarters.
At $1.2 billion, buildings were up 36%. Core platform billings were up 30%, and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, high end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth with a mix shifting 6 points towards high-end appliances. Platform extension billings were up 50% and accounted for 33% of total billings, up 3 percentage points. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and down 1 month sequentially at 27 months.
Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin was 74.4% as the revenue mix tilted 5 percentage points to product revenue from higher-margin services. Product gross margin of 57.4% reflects the impact of component and freight cost increases as well as higher less predictable component expedite fee expenses and the impact of consolidating ALAXALA's results. Service gross margin of 85.2% was impacted by ALAXALA, costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint and increased labor costs.
Operating margin of 22%, exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 200 basis points due to increased sales productivity and efficiencies in other OpEx areas offsetting the gross margin decline. Headcount increased 26% to 10,860.
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $273 million, representing a margin of 29%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $123 million, including $93 million for real estate investments. Adjusted for real estate purchases, our free cash flow margin was 38%.
Our capital expenditure strategy includes investing in cloud and data center infrastructure, as well as our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $691 million. At the end of the quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $830 million, with the authorization set to expire in February 2023. Inventory turns at 3.5x were up nearly 1.5x year-over-year.
Now let's spend some time reviewing backlog in a bit more detail. As I mentioned earlier, very strong demand for about $116 million increase in total backlog to $278 million. To put this in perspective, total backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6% of our trailing 12 months total billings. We shipped 60% of the Q4 ending hardware backlog in the quarter.
And consistent with prior quarters -- the prior quarter, 73% of the backlog relates to expected future product shipments, while the remaining 27% relates to various services. We believe our backlog is very strong and should provide a billings and revenue tailwind to growth in future periods.
And there are several reasons and comments we make to support our view, including, existing customers account for 93% of our backlog. And no single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog. There are 10 deals in backlog, 9 from existing customers with the remaining balance of over $1 million that together, account for less than 10% of total backlog. Remaining balances defined as the original order amount less the partial shipments we've made. Just 5% of Q4 backlog was canceled in Q1, suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to our backlog.
We do not believe that customers are meaningfully pivoting to software form factors from hardware. The software is frequently a more costly option and may require architectural redesign and investment and changes in form factors and other equipment beyond just the firewalls. We believe our competitors are similarly impacted by the supply chain. And finally, more customers are accepting the supply chain challenges and working with us to mitigate the issues by switching products, adjusting deployment schedules and accelerating evaluations of new products.
Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Our responses to these challenges include: significantly increasing inventory purchase commitments; redesigning products; qualifying additional suppliers; and working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions. We expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect component and logistics costs remain elevated and backlog to increase through the course of the year.
As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing pressure to gross margins. While the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. The outlook is also subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.
For the second quarter, we anticipate bookings in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 40%. And we expect billings in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.265 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%.
Revenue in the range of $1.005 billion to $1.035 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, which assumes a share count of $165 million to $167 million. We estimate second quarter capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%.
For the full year, we anticipate backlog could approach or possibly exceed $500 million, and expect billings in the range of $5.500 billion to $5.508 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 32.5%. The revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 31%. This assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year.
Total service revenue in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, which represents growth of approximately 28%, and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 36%.
Given our current view of component costs and other supply chain pressures, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures of between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $260 million.
Lastly, I want to remind everyone that we'll be holding an Analyst Day on May 10, coinciding with Accelerate 2022. A link to register for the webcast is located on the Events and Presentation page of Fortinet's Investor Relations website.

So that's where compared to a lot of other vendors using like third-party on-time supply, which has more difficult to deal with the current supply chain issue. So we do see like with the price increase sometime like as Keith mentioned, there are some more strong requests for some discount and which also we have actually discount, probably to discount more easy to go to a product side than compared to the service side. There's a certain recognition roof, you cannot discount service too much.
But also since we have a very strong product, we use security computing region. So that's where for the same function, our performance tend to be 5x better than competitors. So we do have a market pricing power, which converts customers to move towards our product.
At the same time, thinking for the service, we do offer a very broad service, similar better than competitor, but we probably only had about average about half, especially with all the bond orders since. So that's where we do have the pricing power, both on the product and service. That's where the customer doing this time to towards our solution.

I don't know that us versus more traditional networking companies have any more availability in those products than anybody else. And when we look at our backlog, that mix seems to certainly support that.
Firewalls, I don't see a lot of customers switching over availability. I offered the comment earlier in the script, the prepared remarks that 93% of our existing backlog -- or pardon me, of our backlog is with existing customers. So there's 7% of new logos information in that number, not a very big number. And if I look at new logos in terms of the billings and accounts that we got from the quarter, it was very, very normal in terms of both of the billings and the new logos. I think we're about 5,500 or so on new logo. So I don't really see that, if you will, to the concern.
And then if I can pivot back to Panama just quickly, I think your final question was about pull forward and space come up again. But again, I think if we were seeing that in light of these tremendous results. I don't think I'd sit here and see a pipeline with such a significant growth is what we're seeing.

So if silicon products, I'm surely they can easily steer to the next product and -- but still offer much better solution compared to other competitors.

They have to work together. But there's a significant investment there.

Obviously, the high-end FortiGates are very much targeted at large enterprises. And I think that dovetails very nicely with some of the growth numbers that we gave on G2000 and on the large enterprises as well.
I still think that, that's an opportunity for us where we have sometimes not always viewed as being viewed as the incumbent. But I think if you look at our progress over the years in the enterprise sector, particularly in the U.S., which maybe has a little further to go, we're very, very pleased with that.
And I would maybe supplement that in terms of enterprise success with the metric that we've talked about from time to time in the past. I think maybe 3 or 4 years ago, we talked about in the U.S. of having an account rep ratio of about 65 accounts to 1 rep in the U.S. And that's not really an enterprise model. And then we made a comment that continuously that we would work to move that number down within the framework with balanced growth and profitability. That number today is about 13 or 14 accounts per rep.

I think as it relates to how we think about what the backlog might mean, and we just remind people, we made the switch, I think, in the middle of the fourth quarter, asked our sales team to run the business on bookings, and then we would convert it to buildings here, which means working very, very close with our manufacturing team and our operations team in terms of what they're seeing in terms of availability and what levers they have to pull.
And with that in mind, I think the key now, I spend a lot more time with operations as part of the forecasting guidance process than I do with the sales team. And where we've kind of sold out on that is that I get a weekly update from the sales team in terms of what their expectations of backlog are going to be, and we've been doing that every week this year, and I think some of last year. And how they've shown to be fairly darn accurate. I think what you see right now in the first quarter was very high bookings, which drag along some backlog. But I think that the operations team has done a very good job.
One thing that we do now use is this concept of what -- how much was net backlog increased as a percentage of bookings. And that number has hovered right around 8.5% to 9% in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. And so when we want to sanity check, what we're hearing from the operations team, we now have a metric that we didn't have 6 months ago in terms of a little bit of history, and we apply that metric to it, say, does that seem reasonable for all their hard work when you get done, does it seem like it's a reasonable number, and we think it has been."

Our better-than-expected first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand of our cybersecurity innovation. Total revenue growth of 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Total billings increased 36%. Our strong results reflect new order that was significantly greater than anticipated, partially offset by an increase in backlog. 
As a result, bookings increased 50% year-over-year to 1,276 billion, which included booking growth for SD-WAN or 54%, Global 2000 growth of 61%, OT growth of 76%. For the quarter, net new backlog was 9% of bookings as we continue to navigate a challenging supply chain environment. 
We believe that the hybrid network adhere for foreseeable future and Fortinet is pushing the boundary of what is possible with innovation to enable customers to successfully operate in today's elevated threat environment. Our solid performance and market share gains are being driven by our effort to make our customers' entire infrastructure more secure and integrate in a zero-trust network.
Fortinet's security-driven networking approach converges networking functionality with security capabilities fueled by our powerful FortiASIC SPUs to provide the best performance and rich functionality. The new FortiOS 7.2 offers multiple new and enhanced services across FortiGuard, FortiCare and FortiTrust such as ZTNA, identity, inline Sandboxing, Advanced Device Protection for OT and IoT environments, SOC-as-a-Service, and inline CASB. And Fortinet provides one of the broadest security services offerings at an average of half the cost compared with our main competitors. In addition, we have prioritized our mostly organic research and development efforts on integrating security products into our centralized FortiOS fabric platform which Gartner refers to as a Cybersecurity
MESH architecture.
Today we announced a new suite of FortiGates powered by our FortiASIC SPU. The FortiGates 3700F, 600F and 70F deliver high-performance converged networking and security with Security Compute Ratings of 5x on average, better performance than competitive offerings.
During the quarter, we were pleased to receive the Gartner Peer Insights Customer Choice Awards for both WAN Edge Infrastructure and Next-Generation Firewalls for 3 Years in a row. Our innovations position Fortinet as one of the most influential cybersecurity leaders. These growth drivers and organic innovations are accelerating our growth potential to new levels.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. It is their collective efforts and trust that are contributing to Fortinet's strong growth and market share gains."

Customer demand was again strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting 3 key demand drivers: The elevated threat environment, convergence of security and networking and customers consolidating across our platform offerings. 
These key growth drivers are contributing to our strong results and accelerating pipeline growth. In short, we believe we are in a period of sustained high growth for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet.
Moving to the Q1 financial results. Total revenue of $955 million, was up 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Taking into account an $80 million sequential increase in product backlog, product bookings growth was 87%. Product revenue growth was broad-based with Core Platform and Platform Extension product revenue growth at 50% and 59%, respectively.
While we continue to see robust product growth from our SD-WAN and Operational Technology, or OT, the Core Platform product revenue growth was mainly driven by the wide range of other use cases embedded in our operating system.
Service revenue was up 24% to $584 million. Support and related services was up 26% to $271 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 23% to $313 million. 
To offer one observation about how customers may be responding to the supply chain challenges, we are seeing indications that a subset of customers placed product orders further in advance and may have delayed purchases or registrations of the related service contracts. This, together with the timing differences related to product and service revenue recognition, creates a lag between product and service revenue growth. We expect quarterly service revenue growth to accelerate throughout the rest of the year.
As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 32%, EMEA revenue increased 25%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 57%, which includes the contribution from AlaxalA.
EMEA's growth includes the impact of suspending operations in Russia. Nonetheless, EMEA easily exceeded our internal targets.
Looking forward, EMEAâ€™s pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our EMEA business, despite the situation in Eastern Europe and its potential impact on European economies.
Platform Extension revenue grew 49% and accounted for 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points.
Moving to bookings, backlog and billings. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that continues to exceed supply by more than historical norms. Bookings were up 50% to $1.3 billion, reflecting exceptional demand and a $116 million quarter-over-quarter increase in total backlog, bringing backlog to $278 million.
Larger enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's industry-leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform strategy. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products.
The following key metrics illustrate growing demand from enterprise customers. Global 2000 bookings were up over 60%. Large enterprise bookings were up over 65%. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew 54%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong economic case. OT bookings were up 76%, illustrating the continued response to the elevated threat environment.
As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. However, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top line tailwind in future quarters.
At $1.2 billion, buildings were up 36%. 
Core Platform billings were up 30%, and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 6 points towards high-end appliances. 
Platform Extension billings were up 50% and accounted for 33% of total billings, up 3 percentage points. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and down 1 month sequentially at 27 months.
Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin was 74.4% as the revenue mix tilted 5 percentage points to product revenue from higher margin services. Product gross margin of 57.4% reflects the impact of component and freight cost increases as well as higher, less predictable component expedite fee expenses, and the impact of consolidating AlaxalA's results. Service gross margin of 85.2% was impacted by AlaxalA, costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint, and increased labor costs.
Operating margin of 22.0% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by 200 basis points due to increased sales productivity and efficiencies in other OpEx areas, offsetting the gross margin decline.
Headcount increased 26% to 10,860.
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $273 million, representing a margin of 29%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $123 million, including $93 million for real estate investments. Adjusted for real estate purchases, our free cash flow margin was 38%. Our capital expenditure strategy includes investing in cloud and data center infrastructure as well as our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth.
We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $691 million. At end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was
Approximately $830 million with the authorization set to expire in February 2023.
Inventory turns of 3.5 times were up nearly 1.5x year-over-year. 
Now let's spend some time reviewing backlog in a bit more detail. As I mentioned earlier, very strong demand drove a $116 million increase in total backlog to $278 million. To put this in perspective, total backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6% of our trailing 12 months total billings. We shipped 60% of the Q4 ending hardware backlog in the quarter.
Consistent with the prior quarter, 73% of the backlog relates to expected future product shipments, while the remaining 27% relates to various services.
We believe our backlog is very strong and should provide a billings and revenue tailwind to growth in future periods. There are several reasons that support our view, including existing customers account for 93% of our backlog and no single end customer accounts for more than a low single digit percentage of backlog. There are 10 deals in backlog, 9 from existing customers, with the remaining balance of over $1 million that together account for less than 10% of total backlog. Remaining balance is defined as the original order amount less the partial shipments we've made. Just 5% of Q4 backlog was canceled in Q1, suggesting that double-ordering is not a significant contributor to our backlog.
We do not believe that customers are meaningfully pivoting to software form factors from hardware. The software is frequently a more costly option and may require architectural redesign and investment and changes in form factors and other equipment beyond just the firewalls. We believe our competitors are similarly impacted by the supply chain. And finally, more customers are accepting the supply chain challenges and working with us to mitigate the issues by switching products, adjusting deployment schedules and accelerating evaluations of new products.
Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Our responses to these challenges include: significantly increasing inventory purchase commitments; redesigning products; qualifying additional suppliers; and working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions. 
We expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect component and logistics costs remain elevated and backlog to increase through the course of the year.
As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing pressure to gross margins. 
While the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. The outlook is also subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.
For the second quarter, we anticipate bookings in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 40%. And we expect billings in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.265 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%.
Revenue in the range of $1.005 billion to $1.035 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, which assumes a share count of $165 million to $167 million. We estimate second quarter capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%.
For the full year, we anticipate backlog could approach or possibly exceed $500 million; and expect billings in the range of $5.500 billion to $5.508 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 32.5%; the revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 31%. This assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year. Total service revenue in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, which represents growth of approximately 28% and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 36%.
Given our current view of component costs and other supply chain pressures, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures of between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $260 million.
Lastly, I want to remind everyone that we'll be holding an Analyst Day on May 10, coinciding with Accelerate 2022. A link to register for the webcast is located on the Events and Presentation page of Fortinet's Investor Relations website.
And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A."

So that's where -- compared to a lot of other vendors using like third-party on-time supply, which has more difficult to deal with the current supply chain issue.
So we do see like with the price increase sometime like as Keith mentioned, there are some more strong requests for some discount and which also we have actually discount, probably to discount more easy to go to a product side than compared to the service side. There's a certain recognition roof. You cannot discount service too much.
But also since we have a very strong product, we use security computing region. So that's where for the same function, our performance tend to be 5x better than competitors. So we do have a market pricing power, which converts customers to move towards our product.
At the same time, thinking for the service, we do offer a very broad service, similar better than competitor, but we probably only had about average about half, especially with all the bond orders since. So that's where we do have the pricing power, both on the product and service. That's where the customer doing this time to towards our solution. And also there's a lot of new cases, which our competitors don't have in solution like whether the SD-WAN, vertical to OT, some other part, which also drives quite a lot of additional growth for us."

I think if you think about the market, let's take the networking equipment, switches and access points. I think the constraint exists all around the board, if you will. I don't know that us versus more traditional networking companies have any more availability in those products than anybody else. And when we look at our backlog, that mix seems to certainly support that.
Firewalls, I don't see a lot of customers switching over availability. I offered the comment earlier in the script, the prepared remarks that 93% of our existing backlog -- or pardon me, of our backlog is with existing customers. So there's 7% of new logos information in that number, not a very big number. And if I look at new logos in terms of the billings and accounts that we got from the quarter, it was very, very normal in terms of both of the billings and the new logos. I think we're about 5,500 or so on new logo. So I don't really see that, if you will, to the concern.
And then if I can pivot back to Panama just quickly, I think your final question was about pull forward and space come up again. But again, I think if we were seeing that in light of these tremendous results. I don't think I'd sit here and see a pipeline with such a significant growth is what we're seeing. So I don't really know that I would describe this as any sort of pull forward.
Are there customers, large enterprises that came to us in place orders for a longer period deployment schedules? Certainly, and I think some of the comments in the script covered that."

But also in general, we have a much broader product, both in the -- we call the core product FortiGate platform and also the platform extension. And so that's gives customers a much better choice.
So if silicon products, I'm surely they can easily steer to the next product and -- but still offer much better solution compared to other competitors. So that's where the redesign actually do help in a lot to reduce the supply chain limitation we have and also give customers more choice. So we kind of -- we're keeping that effort and keeping off a very broad product portfolio and which we do feel during the supply chain issue or maybe will last you towards the whole year this year will be definitely helping us and helping customers."

They have to work together. But there's a significant investment there.

Obviously, the high-end FortiGates are very much targeted at large enterprises. And I think that dovetails very nicely with some of the growth numbers that we gave on G2000 and on the large enterprises as well.
I still think that, that's an opportunity for us where we have sometimes not always viewed as being viewed as the incumbent. But I think if you look at our progress over the years in the enterprise sector, particularly in the U.S., which maybe has a little further to go, we're very, very pleased with that.
And I would maybe supplement that in terms of enterprise success with the metric that we've talked about from time to time in the past. I think maybe 3 or 4 years ago, we talked about in the U.S. of having an account rep ratio of about 65 accounts to 1 rep in the U.S. And that's not really an enterprise model. 
And then we made a comment that continuously that we would work to move that number down within the framework with balanced growth and profitability. That number today is about 13 or 14 accounts per rep. So I don't think it's a coincidence that you're seeing the success in the large enterprise with the large appliances given the level of investment that we've been able to make in that segment of the market."

Like in the past, whether in the high-speed environment or kind of a branch or remote access is very, very difficult to involve in security because of speed requirement because all these kind of difficult to manage.
So that's what we see with our own ASIC and the long-term investments on ASIC, which will enable us to really get in this new area, the traditional network security cannot solve. So that's where we see huge growth in this area.
And at the same time, we do keep in promoting we call the convergence and network security. So that's where we competing power from ASIC and also the new FortiOS keeping upgrade every year. So we do see more and more security case and more security being deployed in the whole infrastructure just beyond the traditional network security deployment."

I think as it relates to how we think about what the backlog might mean, and we just remind people, we made the switch, I think, in the middle of the fourth quarter, asked our sales team to run the business on bookings, and then we would convert it to buildings here, which means working very, very close with our manufacturing team and our operations team in terms of what they're seeing in terms of availability and what levers they have to pull.
And with that in mind, I think the key now, I spend a lot more time with operations as part of the forecasting guidance process than I do with the sales team. And where we've kind of sold out on that is that I get a weekly update from the sales team in terms of what their expectations of backlog are going to be, and we've been doing that every week this year, and I think some of last year. And how they've shown to be fairly darn accurate. I think what you see right now in the first quarter was very high bookings, which drag along some backlog. But I think that the operations team has done a very good job.
One thing that we do now use is this concept of what -- how much was net backlog increased as a percentage of bookings. And that number has hovered right around 8.5% to 9% in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. And so when we want to sanity check, what we're hearing from the operations team, we now have a metric that we didn't have 6 months ago in terms of a little bit of history, and we apply that metric to it, say, does that seem reasonable for all their hard work when you get done, does it seem like it's a reasonable number, and we think it has been."

Thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2022 results. Total billings increased 36%, the sixth consecutive quarter of only 35% year-over-year billing growth. Revenue grew 29%, driven by 34% of product revenue growth. SD-WAN and OT booking grew over 60% and 75%, which together accounted for 25% of total second quarter growth. Our better-than-expected performance demonstrate the strong demand for our cyber security innovation. 
Fortinet is at the forefront of networking and security convergence, enabling our customer to reduce complexity while securing and connecting hybrid and remote user to advance security with superior performance. Today, we announced the FortiGate 4800F, our latest innovation in converged security. The 4800F is the world's fastest compact firewall for hyperscale data center and 5G network, powered by Fortinet SPU, the 4800F delivers security compute meeting of our average 5 to 10x better performance than competitive solutions, acquired the sixth most common and functions. 
A leader in the government magic quadrant for 1 age infrastructure, Fortinet continue to take market share for Secure SD-WAN. Our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution powered by Fortinet SPU-SOC4 delivered huge performance, security and efficiency over traditional offerings. 
In addition to convergence, consolidation of vendor and product functionality is an other major trend, particularly in network security. In a recent CECL survey, garner from the percentage of company's survey who want a fuel security provider increased to 75% from only 29% in 2020. With over 30 product lines built mostly by our in-house strong engineering and development innovation, Fortinet has benefited from this consolidation with our Security Fabric mesh offering. The Fortinet security match platform delivered unparalleled protection with a broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid environment. These 2 major trends, convergence and consolidation position Fortinet well for long-term growth. 
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work that continuing to Fortinet's strong growth."
2689126,1789593466,2614419,"Fortinet, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2022",2022-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Fortinet, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with a more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrati",2013,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with a more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrating the strong growth from our 3 key growth drivers: First, an elevated threat environment; second, the convergence of security and networking; and third, the consolidation of security products across our platform offerings. 
Total revenue of $1.03 billion was up 29%, passing the $1 billion milestone in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Total product revenue growth was up 34%. Core platform and platform extension product revenue growth was up 35% and 33%, respectively. We continue to see robust product revenue growth from a wide range of security use cases, including Secure SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT. Total service revenue growth increased sequentially to 25%, resulting in service revenue of $629 million. Support and related service revenue was up 26% to $289 million, while security subscription service revenue was up 25% or 2 points sequentially to $340 million. 
Service billings defined as total billings minus product revenue were up 36%. The year-over-year growth rate for short-term deferred revenue has increased for 6 quarters in a row from under 21% in Q4 of 2020 to just over 31% in Q2 of 2022, the highest short-term deferred revenue growth rate in over 6 years. 
The accelerating growth rate for service billings and short-term deferred revenue reflect the earlier pricing actions that quickly appeared in product revenue, and they are now beginning to appear in service revenue. The pricing benefit more than offset various service revenue headwinds, including suspending services in Russia, an increase in the average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activated securities contract, and the impact of contract manufacturers delaying deliveries to later in the quarter, which limits our service revenue and new sales recognized in the quarter. With the growth and pricing benefits more than offsetting these headwinds, we expect service revenue growth will continue to accelerate through 2022 and into next year. 
As summarized on Slide 6, Total revenue in the Americas increased 23%, EMEA revenue increased 28%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 42%. Despite macro conditions that may be more readily impacting other industries, our pipeline growth remains strong. In particular, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our European business. 
Moving to a summary of our success with the large enterprises. Large enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's leading cost or performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. 
Our success with large enterprise customers includes: Global 2000 bookings growth of over 65% year-over-year and on a rolling 4-quarter basis; large enterprise booking growth of over 55% year-over-year and on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and the number of deals of $1 million increased over 50% to [ 822 ] deals and the total billings value of these transactions doubled. 
Secure SD-WAN bookings grew over 60%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong ROI for our customers. OT bookings were up over 75%, reflecting the continued response to the elevated threat environment. 
Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.3 billion were up 36%, as Ken pointed out, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. I'll pause here to offer thoughts on product refresh cycles and their impact on our financial results. Specifically, we do not believe new product releases, driving near-term spike in our top line growth. Rather, we believe the continual nature of our product releases drives long-term growth. For example, each new ASIC is included in a series of products released over several years. Our most recent ASIC chip, the NP7 security processing unit, was introduced in Q1 of 2020. Including the 4800F announced today, we have released 9 high-end core platform products with the NP7 chip. And over the next several quarters, we will release several additional mid-range and high-end products with the NP7. 
And lastly, I would note that since the start of 2019, we have released over 23 new FortiGate models. While some of our competitors which have much shorter product SKU list may have shown clear signs of product refresh cycles. Our strong long-term performance illustrates an extended series of overlapping product maturity curves. 
Core Platform billings were up 32% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, midrange FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the shift mixing 5 points in their favor, driven by demand as well as supply availability. Platform extension billings were up 44%, accounted for 31% of total billings, a mix shift of over 1.5 points. Average contract term was up 1 month year-over-year to 29 months, driven by the strength from large enterprise customers and the 50% plus increase in the number of deals greater than $1 million. 
Worldwide government buildings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 15% and were up 45%. The top 5 verticals accounted for 60% of total billings. 
Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin of 76.5% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 125 basis points, even as component, labor and freight costs increased, and the year-over-year revenue mix shifted 2 points to product revenue from higher-margin service revenue. Product gross margin of 61.9% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 450 basis points sequentially, as pricing actions, product mix and lower discounting offset higher component and other costs. Service gross margin of 85.9% was down 100 basis points due to increased costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint as well as labor costs and other costs, partially offset by benefits from FX and some of the earlier pricing actions. 
Operating margin of 24.8% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 200 basis points. The year-over-year comparison saw the FX benefit offset by lower gross margins, increased travel and marketing costs and other costs. Headcount increased 27% to 11,500. 
Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $284 million and was impacted by increases in DSO and cash taxes. DSO increased 14 days year-over-year and 5 days sequentially to 80 days due to the change in billing linearity driven by the timing of inventory deliveries from contract manufacturers. And new R&D capitalization rules increased second quarter cash taxes by $85 million to $110 million. Second half cash taxes of approximately $135 million are expected to be more evenly spread across the third and fourth quarters. 
For the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow margin, which excludes real estate spending was 34%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million, including $21 million for real estate investments. We repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $800 million, bringing the total year-to-date shares repurchased to [ $25 ] million for a total cost of $1.5 billion. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization is now $1.030 billion. Inventory turns at 21x were up 0.5 turn year-over-year and down to 0.5 turn sequentially. 
Moving to bookings and backlog. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from current quarter billings and revenue. Nonetheless, is it expected to provide increased visibility in the top line tailwind in future quarters. Bookings were up 42% to $1.4 billion. Total backlog of $350 million is up $72 million sequentially and reflects very strong demand. Of the total backlog, networking equipment accounted for about 50%, while FortiGates accounted for about 40%. We believe our backlog is very strong and sticky. Existing customers account for over 95% of total backlog, and no single end customer accounts for more than low single digits as a percentage of backlog. 
There are 4 deals in backlog, all from previously existing customers with the remaining balance of over $2 million, put that together account for only 6% of total backlog. Just 4% of ending Q1 backlog was canceled in Q2 and about half the deals in the backlog have been partially fulfilled suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to backlog. Consistent with the first quarter, we shipped approximately 60% of the prior quarter's backlog in the current quarter as our operation and R&D teams did an excellent job navigating the tough supply chain environment. Nonetheless, we still expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. 
We are continuing to address the supply chain challenges in a number of ways, including by increasing inventory purchase commitments, redesigning products, qualifying additional suppliers and certain pricing actions. We believe that even with these actions, demand will continue to outstrip supply. As a result, we expect backlog to continue to increase in 2022. And while the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. 
As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing gross margin volatility from these increases as well as shifts in our product mix related to inventory availability. 
Before reviewing our guidance, let's offer a few for net specific observations and areas you may have heard discuss elsewhere. In Q2, we noticed certain larger transactions with increased or elongated negotiating cycles. Also, the -- pushed to later in the quarter and later in the last month of the quarter, mainly due to supply constraints in the deliveries. Lastly, close rates were strong, and importantly, the aggregate value of deals that pushed were within our historical norms. 
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter as summarized on Slide 10, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we anticipate our solid third quarter pipeline growth across deal types, sizes and geographies to support the following: bookings in the range of $1.455 billion to $1.485 billion, which at midpoint represents bookings growth of 36%. Billings in the range of [ $1.35 ] billion to $1.415 billion, which represents growth of 32%. Revenue in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.135 billion, which represents growth of 29%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.28, which assumes a share count of between $810 million and the $820 million. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures between $105 million and $115 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. 
For the full year, we anticipate backlog that could approach or possibly exceed $500 million. That will be offset by robust industry growth, pipeline strength and market share gains, fueling our growth and supporting the following: billings in the range of $5.560 billion to $5.640 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 34%; revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which represents growth of 31%. Total service revenue range of $2.620 billion to $2.670 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 38%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.06 and which assumes a share count of between $810 million and $820 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures between $300 million and $330 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes for the year to be $265 million. As I mentioned earlier, cash taxes paid are higher in 2022 due to the new R&D capitalization rules in the U.S. 
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers, all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session."

I don't think -- Brian, I don't think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe exactly a couple of questions at once.

I don't think -- Brian, I don't think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe exactly a couple of questions at once. I think the answer to your question about service revenue, I think the biggest change from where we started the year is really about Russia. If you think about Russia, we talked at the very beginning, it's about 1.5% of our total revenue. And it applies to the service revenue line as well. Earlier in the year, we stopped recognizing revenue on existing contracts for services that provide in Russia in conjunction with our suspending of services. At that time, we did not anticipate it would be a full year event, but we are now. And if you kind of think through that 1.5% of service revenues in Russia, so we really backed out now for the full year about $25 million of revenue related to Russia. That's the largest change there. 
I think the delay in registrations from when contracts are sold, when they're actually registered by customers, I think we pretty much got out of the quarter what we expected on that. That seems to be something in the current environment with inventory constraints that we're going to continue to see. I think the linearity part of it is a little bit new in that because the shipments occurred later in the quarter, there really wasn't the opportunity to get the service revenue from those Q2 shipments that we would normally get. And so I think those are really the parts to put together there. 
On the other side, I would probably point to, again, the short-term deferred revenue billings and the number that we're putting up the growth that you're seeing with that number as well as service buildings itself. And I think the last comment on this, and we haven't talked about it before, is that the service contracts are really using a lose-it contract, meaning it's not that they have the ability to cancel, they just have the ability to postponed the registration for a period of time, whether depending upon the geography, whether that's 90 days or 1 year or what have you. So eventually, it comes to revenue, but the timing has been pushed out to that aspect."

Also, I don't want to the thing that it's naive that as backlog gets older, and it's also why we provide that 60% of shipments from prior backlog number for -- The Street to try and understand it. But if that number starts to tick up, obviously, there's more risk in it. I think it's important to understand the guidance that we provide really isn't reflecting in any sort of shift in the backlog that we're going to ship a lot of things from backlog. So I think we're fairly prudent in that regard, and I think we're also comfortable with described as the stickiness of the backlog number. ."

So we do see the change in acceleration and also the convergence consolidation going on in the whole space right now pretty much flat amount of growth."

I think the one thing that we're looking at internally, it's just that the interplay between bookings, backlog and billings and trying to really get a sense of the direction of the business. And the example I kind of gave us, we had a very good quarter on the midrange of the product. But some of that was due to availability. Demand was very strong, but it was also because we had the midrange product available. We didn't have as much product available in the low end. Now as we shifted this third quarter, I think we're probably going to see the low end availability improved fairly dramatically. And so when you're looking at billings information that we have historically disclosed and trying to gauge the direction of the business, it gets a little bit distorted now just in terms of what's available. And I think of the total when you look at bookings and backlog, there's some of that as well in terms of the characterization of what the booking is versus the characterization of what's available to ship and what comes in the billings side."

And I'll take the last one first because I think it's probably very important and I probably forgot the first one already. So one of the things that we do is we track very religiously in our CRM tool when a customer -- if we lose a deal, we want to know why, right? Is it because we could not overcome the incumbency, it because the channel partner may have had a bias, if you will, to one of our competitors. A feature issue functionality issue or something like that. But other specifically, do we lose on price. And we've been tracking that now for over a year. And that percentage, which is low -- lower than the other ones that I just gave in to you, has been extremely consistent. And so with that very consistent loss percentage, if you will, I translate that into price elasticity, which tells me that the question is always how far can you push the envelope. We know we come into the conversation with a significant price performance advantage, The Street sometimes -- or channels or business say 30% or 40%. We have not in the beginning of this phase of the economic cycle. And the question has become how far can we push that. But again, keep in mind, our goal is really to try to a longer period of time just match the cost increases and maintain a consistent margin. It's not that we're really trying to take down more margin. Now you will get volatility quarter-to-quarter because of the mix and things like that. So a long-winded way to say, I think I really hang my head on what I'm seeing and we're tracking on the CRM data about reasons that we lose deals and reasons that we win deals."

Also, the other is really like the product we released today on average for the same function for the same price range. Our product has a performance to tune better than competitors. Like Keith mentioned, on the CRM on the tracking, we don't see any big loss kind of changing even. But if you do not actually improve because we still have a huge price advantage compared to competitors. 
The other thing also may be mentioned to the service. I think one we may try to improve a little bit going forward is really even in the last few quarters, we increased some of the price more on the new product release, but we are not changing the price for the expired product. Basically, the product is still added to the service like 5, 6 right? So that's one thing we made because the labor cost on the surface on supporting, so we may have to increase the price of the outdated product under shipping because all the service of the renew still tied to the old product, which is no longer shipping but is the customer still buying the renewal by the service based on the old product. So that's probably -- we can also help in the improving the service and also help in the margin and compensate our additional costs, especially on the labor."

Because of the timing of when the finish -- when the inventory is delivered from the contract manufacturers, we see a shift in that linearity of when we receive inventory from our contract manufacturers. That shift then it translates into when we can turn around QA, et cetera, and ship it out to our customers and sell it. So there's a different aspect of linear that's come into play here now. So service contracts that maybe would have been sold in the first month of the quarter, actually got sold in the third month of the quarter. So we lose service revenue from that. And you see that appearing in the DSO and you see it appearing in the free cash flow. .
On the negotiating side of it, I think what we saw, and I don't know if this is common ever, but others -- what we saw was probably the first 2 weeks of June and maybe there was more conversation around recession and concerns there, if you will, a bit of a pause in terms of deal closure rates for those first 10 days of June and then a reacceleration as we got through the end of June. We did notice or I did notice during that time frame. Maybe additional parties were being introduced to either as an approver or a negotiator, if you will, on some of the larger deals just to make sure on the customer side that they were making the right decision. And I think that's why I went on to say in the prepared remarks, not only did we notice this shift, but the close rates, which were important actually were up just a tad in the quarter. So I think there was just for whatever reason, there was a slight pause there for a couple of weeks in June and everybody came back and got the deals done by -- on the customer side and our side at that last week in June."

And also, we see more like a deal involving multiple products, not just the FortiGate, but also we call the non-FortiGate platform retention, which also take a little bit long time to test the value to close. .
On the supply chain, since really compared to before the pandemic, we probably ship majority even most of the products by sea. Now we're pretty much shipping every product by air. That's where the timing of the supply shipping the product to us is pretty critical for the generic. And so last quarter, we do experience a lot of product being shipped in end of the quarter from suppliers, that drive the linearity. Even if we have the booking but we are the way like a few were a couple of months before the product was shipped to the customer more towards the quarter end because the supply shipping glass pretty much in the end of the quarter. So we do see long term, this will be changing improving. We'll keep increase some of the product inventory and improving the product return and also balance among not just shipping everything by air, but some by ASM by ocean."

And the question that we were addressing has seen for 8, 12 quarters probably in a row was how is that mix shifting and how is that coming into it. And we were providing information back then about all the buildings, so to speak, are in the 24/7, but you're not seeing the revenue mix that way because it's kind of that mix has to evolve over time as you go through the installed base. Price increases for service revenue, this is just another flavor of the same thing that way. You're going to see the benefit over a much longer period of time on the service revenue line. you will see the benefit in buildings much sooner, and that's why we gave that information earlier, any kind of a you're looking at, that's a very good leading indicator of where service revenue growth is going to go in the future."

When you look at our FortiGate firewall product families, the entry level, the low end, you call it, mid-range and high end. 
In general, the margins increased -- the gross margin increases as you move up from the entry level to the higher end of it. So from that aspect of it, and that's why the comment in the script that there can be gross margin volatility both from the pricing that we've taken and the discounting as well, but also the mix of our product. So in a quarter that we see a higher mix of higher-end firewall shipments, margins will be higher by definition. But there's many puts and takes in there that we -- when we go through the gross margin guidance that we give, hopefully, we're considering all the different puts and takes that are in there, not just the mix of the inventory and the pricing actions."

Thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2022 results. Total billings increased 36%, the sixth consecutive quarter of only 35% year-over-year billing growth. Revenue grew 29%, driven by 34% of product revenue growth. SD-WAN and OT booking grew over 60% and 75%, which together accounted for 25% of total second quarter bookings. Our better-than-expected performance demonstrate the strong demand for our cybersecurity innovation.
Fortinet is at the forefront of networking and security convergence, enabling our customer to reduce complexity while securing and connecting hybrid and remote user to advance security with superior performance. Today, we announced the FortiGate 4800F, our latest innovation in converged network security.
The 4800F is the world's fastest compact firewall for hyperscale data center and 5G network, powered by 400 NP7 SPU, the 4800F delivers Security Compute Rating of an average 5 to 10x better performance than competitive solutions, acquired the sixth most common and important functions. A leader in the government major quadrant for [indiscernible] infrastructure, Fortinet continue to take market share for Secure SD-WAN. Our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution powered by Fortinet SPU-SoC4 delivered huge performance, security and efficiency over traditional offerings.
In addition to convergence, consolidation of vendor and product functionality is another major trend, particularly in network security. In a recent CECL survey, Gartner found the percentage of company's survey who want a fewer security provider increased to 75% from only 29% in 2020. With over 30 product lines built mostly by our in-house strong engineering and development innovation, Fortinet has benefited from this consolidation with our Security Fabric mesh offering.
The Fortinet security mesh platform delivered unparalleled protection with a broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment. These 2 major trends, convergence and consolidation position Fortinet well for long-term growth.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work that are contributing to Fortinet's strong growth."

Let's start with a more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrati",2006,"Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with a more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrating the strong growth from our 3 key growth drivers. First, an elevated threat environment; second, the convergence of security and networking; and third, the consolidation of security products across our platform offerings.
Total revenue of $1.03 billion was up 29%, passing the $1 billion milestone in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Total product revenue growth was up 34%. Core platform and platform extension product revenue growth was up 35% and 33%, respectively. We continue to see robust product revenue growth from a wide range of security use cases, including Secure SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT.
Total service revenue growth increased sequentially to 25%, resulting in service revenue of $629 million. Support and related service revenue was up 26% to $289 million, while security subscription service revenue was up 25% or 2 points sequentially to $340 million.
Service billings defined as total billings minus product revenue were up 36%. The year-over-year growth rate for short-term deferred revenue has increased for 6 quarters in a row from under 21% in Q4 of 2020 to just over 31% in Q2 of 2022, the highest short-term deferred revenue growth rate in over 6 years.
The accelerating growth rate for service billings and short-term deferred revenue reflect the earlier pricing actions that quickly appeared in product revenue, and they are now beginning to appear in service revenue. The pricing benefit more than offset various service revenue headwinds, including suspending services in Russia, an increase in the average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract, and the impact of contract manufacturers delaying deliveries to later in the quarter, which limits our service revenue on new sales recognized in the quarter. With the growth and pricing benefits more than offsetting these headwinds, we expect service revenue growth will continue to accelerate through 2022 and into next year.
As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 23%, EMEA revenue increased 28%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 42%. Despite macro conditions that may be more readily impacting other industries, our pipeline growth remains strong. In particular, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our European business.
Moving to a summary of our success with the large enterprises. Large enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products.
Our success with large enterprise customers includes: Global 2000 bookings growth of over 65% year-over-year and on a rolling 4-quarter basis; large enterprise booking growth of over 55% year-over-year and on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and the number of deals of $1 million increased over 50% to 122 deals and the total billings value of these transactions doubled.
Secure SD-WAN bookings grew over 60%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong ROI for our customers. OT bookings were up over 75%, reflecting the continued response to the elevated threat environment.
Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.3 billion were up 36%, as Ken pointed out, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. I'll pause here to offer thoughts on product refresh cycles and their impact on our financial results. Specifically, we do not believe new product releases, driving near-term spike in our top line growth. Rather, we believe the continual nature of our product releases drives long-term growth. For example, each new ASIC is included in a series of products released over several years. Our most recent ASIC chip, the NP7 security processing unit, was introduced in Q1 of 2020. Including the 4800F announced today, we have released 9 high-end core platform products with the NP7 chip. And over the next several quarters, we will release several additional mid-range and high-end products with the NP7.
And lastly, I would note that since the start of 2019, we have released over 23 new FortiGate models. While some of our competitors which have much shorter product SKU list, may have shown clear signs of product refresh cycles. Our strong long-term performance illustrates an extended series of overlapping product maturity curves.
Core platform billings were up 32% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, midrange FortiGate posted very strong billings growth with the shift mixing 5 points in their favor, driven by demand as well as supply availability. Platform extension billings were up 44%, accounted for 31% of total billings, a mix shift of over 1.5 points. Average contract term was up 1 month year-over-year to 29 months, driven by the strength from large enterprise customers and the 50% plus increase in the number of deals greater than $1 million.
Worldwide, government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 15% and were up 45%. The top 5 verticals accounted for 60% of total billings.
Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin of 76.5% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 125 basis points. Even as component, labor and freight costs increased, and the year-over-year revenue mix shifted 2 points to product revenue from higher-margin service revenue.
Product gross margin of 61.9% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 450 basis points sequentially. As pricing actions, product mix and lower discounting offset higher component and other costs. Service gross margin of 85.9% was down 100 basis points due to increased costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint as well as labor costs and other costs, partially offset by benefits from FX and some of the earlier pricing actions.
Operating margin of 24.8% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 200 basis points. The year-over-year comparison saw the FX benefit offset by lower gross margins, increased travel and marketing costs and other costs. Headcount increased 27% to 11,508.
Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $284 million and was impacted by increases in DSO and cash taxes. DSO increased 14 days year-over-year and 5 days sequentially to 80 days due to the change in billing linearity driven by the timing of inventory deliveries from contract manufacturers. And new R&D capitalization rules increased second quarter cash taxes by $85 million to $110 million. Second half cash taxes of approximately $135 million are expected to be more evenly spread across the third and fourth quarters.
For the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow margin, which excludes real estate spending was 34%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million, including $21 million for real estate investments. We repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $800 million, bringing the total year-to-date shares repurchased to 25.8 million for a total cost of $1.5 billion. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization is now $1.03 billion.
Inventory turns at 3.1x were up 0.5 turn year-over-year and down to 0.5 turn sequentially.
Moving to bookings and backlog. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from current quarter billings and revenue. Nonetheless, is it expected to provide increased visibility in the top line tailwind in future quarters. Bookings were up 42% to $1.4 billion. Total backlog of $350 million is up $72 million sequentially and reflects very strong demand. Of the total backlog, networking equipment accounted for about 50%, while FortiGate accounted for about 40%. We believe our backlog is very strong and sticky. Existing customers account for over 95% of total backlog, and no single end customer accounts for more than low single digits as a percentage of backlog.
There are 4 deals in backlog, all from previously existing customers with the remaining balance of over $2 million, put that together account for only 6% of total backlog. Just 4% of ending Q1 backlog was canceled in Q2 and about half the deals in the backlog have been partially fulfilled suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to backlog. Consistent with the first quarter, we shipped approximately 60% of the prior quarter's backlog in the current quarter as our operation and R&D teams did an excellent job navigating the tough supply chain environment. Nonetheless, we still expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year.
We are continuing to address the supply chain challenges in a number of ways, including by increasing inventory purchase commitments, redesigning products, qualifying additional suppliers and certain pricing actions. We believe that even with these actions, demand will continue to outstrip supply. As a result, we expect backlog to continue to increase in 2022. And while the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance.
As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing gross margin volatility from these increases as well as shifts in our product mix related to inventory availability.
Before reviewing our guidance, let's offer a few Fortinet's specific observations and areas you may have heard discuss elsewhere. In Q2, we noticed certain larger transactions with increased or elongated negotiating cycles. Also, linearity pushed to later in the quarter and later in the last month of the quarter, mainly due to supply constraints in the deliveries.
Lastly, close rates were strong, and importantly, the aggregate value of deals that pushed were within our historical norms.
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter as summarized on Slide 10, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we anticipate our solid third quarter pipeline growth across deal types, sizes and geographies to support the following: bookings in the range of $1.455 billion to $1.485 billion, which at midpoint represents bookings growth of 36%. Billings in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.415 billion, which represents growth of 32%. Revenue in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.135 billion, which represents growth of 29%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.28, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and the 820 million. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures between $105 million and $115 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%.
For the full year, we anticipate backlog that could approach or possibly exceed $500 million. That will be offset by robust industry growth, pipeline strength and market share gains, fueling our growth and supporting the following: billings in the range of $5.560 billion to $5.640 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 34%; revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which represents growth of 31%. Total service revenue range of $2.620 billion to $2.670 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 38%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.06, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures between $300 million and $330 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes for the year to be $265 million. As I mentioned earlier, cash taxes paid are higher in 2022 due to the new R&D capitalization rules in the U.S.
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers, all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success.
I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session."

I don't think -- Brian, I don't think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe exactly a couple of questions at once. I think the answer to your question about service revenue, I think the biggest change from where we started the year is really about Russia. If you think about Russia, we talked at the very beginning, it's about 1.5% of our total revenue. And it applies to the service revenue line as well. Earlier in the year, we stopped recognizing revenue on existing contracts for services that provide in Russia in conjunction with our suspending of services. At that time, we did not anticipate it would be a full year event, but we are now. And if you kind of think through that 1.5% of service revenues in Russia, so we really backed out now for the full year about $25 million of revenue related to Russia. That's the largest change there.
I think the delay in registrations from when contracts are sold, when they're actually registered by customers, I think we pretty much got out of the quarter what we expected on that. That seems to be something in the current environment with inventory constraints that we're going to continue to see. I think the linearity part of it is a little bit new in that because the shipments occurred later in the quarter, there really wasn't the opportunity to get the service revenue from those Q2 shipments that we would normally get. And so I think those are really the parts to put together there.
On the other side, I would probably point to, again, the short-term deferred revenue billings and the number that we're putting up and the growth that you're seeing with that number as well as service billings itself. And I think the last comment on this, and we haven't talked about it before, is that the service contracts are really use-it-or-lose-it contract, meaning it's not that they have the ability to cancel, they just have the ability to postpone the registration for a period of time, whether depending upon the geography, whether that's 90 days or 1 year or what have you. So eventually, it comes to revenue, but the timing has been pushed out to that aspect."

I think it's unlikely that existing customers, particularly those that have received partial shipments are going to cancel. Also, I don't want to think that it's naive that as backlog gets older, and it's also why we provide that 60% of shipments from prior backlog number for the Street to try and understand it. But if that number starts to tick up, obviously, there's more risk in it.
I think it's important to understand the guidance that we provide really isn't reflecting in any sort of shift in the backlog that we're going to ship a lot of things from backlog. So I think we're fairly prudent in that regard, and I think we're also comfortable with described as the stickiness of the backlog number."

And at the same time, Keith has also mentioned a lot of security environment also other drive. So that's where we see the trend will keep going for the next few years.

I think we've been over 40% now for 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters in the bookings line, we feel really, really good about it. I think the one thing that we're looking at internally, it's just that the interplay between bookings, backlog and billings and trying to really get a sense of the direction of the business. And the example I kind of gave us, we had a very good quarter on the midrange of the product. But some of that was due to availability. Demand was very strong, but it was also because we had the midrange product available. We didn't have as much product available in the low end. Now as we shifted this third quarter, I think we're probably going to see the low end availability improved fairly dramatically.
And so when you're looking at billings information that we have historically disclosed and trying to gauge the direction of the business, it gets a little bit distorted now just in terms of what's available. And I think of the total when you look at bookings and backlog, there's some of that as well in terms of the characterization of what the booking is versus the characterization of what's available to ship and what comes in the billings side."

And I'll take the last one first because I think it's probably very important and I probably forgot the first one already. So one of the things that we do is we track very religiously in our CRM tool when a customer -- if we lose a deal, we want to know why, right? Is it because we could not overcome the incumbency, it because the channel partner may have had a bias, if you will, to one of our competitors? A feature issue functionality issue or something like that. But also specifically, do we lose on price. And we've been tracking that now for over a year. And that percentage, which is low, lower than the other ones that I just gave in to you, has been extremely consistent.
And so with that very consistent loss percentage, if you will, I translate that into price elasticity, which tells me that the question is always how far can you push the envelope. We know we come into the conversation with a significant price performance advantage. The Street sometimes -- or channels or business say 30% or 40%. We've known that from the beginning of this phase of the economic cycle. And the question has become how far can we push that.
But again, keep in mind, our goal is really to try to a longer period of time, just match the cost increases and maintain a consistent margin. It's not that we're really trying to take down more margin. Now you will get volatility quarter-to-quarter because of the mix and things like that. So a long-winded way to say, I think I really hang my head on what I'm seeing and we're tracking on the CRM data about reasons that we lose deals and reasons that we win deals."

Our policy tend to be just by the price by small step, but also kind of more open like we do have a new price point basically release every quarter. Also, the other is really like the product we released today on average for the same function for the same price range, our product has a performance 5 to 10 times better than competitors. Like Keith mentioned, on the CRM, on the tracking, we don't see any big loss kind of changing even. But if you do not actually improve because we still have a huge price advantage compared to competitors.
The other thing also may be mentioned to the service. I think one, we may try to improve a little bit going forward is really even in the last few quarters, we increased some of the price more on the new product release, but we are not changing the price for the expired product. Basically, the product is still added to the service like 5, 6, right? So that's one thing we made because the labor cost on the service and supporting, so we may have to increase the price of the outdated product under shipping because all the service of the renew still tied to the old product, which is no longer shipping but is the customer still buying the renewal, buying the service based on the old product. So that's probably -- we can also help in improving the service and also help in the margin and compensate our additional costs, especially on the labor."

Because of the timing of when the finish -- when the inventory is delivered from the contract manufacturers, we see a shift in that linearity of when we receive inventory from our contract manufacturers. That shift then it translates into when we can turn around QA, et cetera, and ship it out to our customers and sell it. So there's a different aspect of linear that's come into play here now. So service contracts that maybe would have been sold in the first month of the quarter, actually got sold in the third month of the quarter. So we lose service revenue from that. And you see that appearing in the DSO and you see it appearing in the free cash flow.
On the negotiating side of it, I think what we saw, and I don't know if this is common ever, but others -- what we saw was probably the first 2 weeks of June and maybe there was more conversation around recession and concerns there, if you will, a bit of a pause in terms of deal closure rates for those first 10 days of June and then a reacceleration as we got through the end of June. We did notice or I did notice during that time frame. Maybe additional parties were being introduced to either as an approver or a negotiator, if you will, on some of the larger deals just to make sure on the customer side that they were making the right decision. And I think that's why I went on to say in the prepared remarks, not only did we notice this shift, but the close rates, which were important actually were up just a tad in the quarter.

So that's the bigger deal also tend to be -- take a little bit longer time to close. And also, we see more like a deal involving multiple products, not just the FortiGate, but also we call the non-FortiGate platform extension, which also take a little bit long time to test the value to close.
On the supply chain, since really compared to before the pandemic, we probably ship majority even most of the products by sea. Now we're pretty much shipping every product by air. That's where the timing of the supply shipping the product to us is pretty critical for the linearity. And so last quarter, we do experience a lot of product being shipped in end of the quarter from suppliers to us, that drive the linearity. Even if we have the booking, but we are the way like a few weeks or even a couple of months before the product was shipped to the customer more towards the quarter end because the supply shipping to us was pretty much in the end of the quarter.
So we do see long term, this will be changing improving. We'll keep increase some of the product inventory and improving the product turn and also balance among not just shipping everything by air, but some by air, some by ocean."

Keith, I want to try to understand, you talked about a few different things impacting the year guide. To put context around it, your revenue guide for '22 isn't changing, which I think is viewed as a disappointment to investors. Now underneath that, services revenues is getting compressed a little bit. And so as you think about why the revenue estimates are going higher for the year, is there a change in, a, the demand level, whether it's the elongation because you said, in fact, there was 2 weeks sort of weak at the end of June, but it sounds like during the last -- through the 3rd of August, things have normalized? Or is it b, -- and/or is it b, supply chain issues that are causing you to not raise your revenue guidance even as you're raising billings modestly? I'm just trying to understand what are the forces that are impacting the lack of raise, if you will? Is it the demand side and/or is it the supply side?"

And at the same time, have to secure the whole infrastructure not only expanding our network security to the networking side, but also like beyond the network security, with the end point, with the cloud, with all the other like application network for e-mail, web, all these are working together. So we do see all these. We keep saying the convergence and consolidation will benefit Fortinet multiple years going forward, a more long-term growth driver for us. And we prepared this in the last like 22 years since start of the company with investment like from ASIC technology for the R&D with most of the product internally developed to integrate, automate together. And so we do see the time is starting coming and for all this investment starting to see some good return.

And I would say, again, if you think about the timing of where when a price increase is effective, right? It's got to go through the process of being preannounced to the channel partners, they get, I think, 60 days of advanced notice and then whether it's actually started to have an impact on it. But keeping that in mind, you do see the impact on pricing actions fairly quickly on product revenue and on billings, whether it's a product or whether it is a service item, right? You will see it there. But on service revenue, you won't see that benefit for an extended period of time.
And I think one thing that may help people, if you think back of our shift from 8x5 support to 24/7 support. We talked about that for several years because when we turned off the 8x5 support, with that came a price lift. And the question that we were addressing has seen for 8, 12 quarters probably in a row was how is that mix shifting and how is that coming into it. And we were providing information back then about all the billings, so to speak, are in the 24/7, but you're not seeing the revenue mix that way because it's kind of that mix has to evolve over time as you go through the installed base.
Price increases for service revenue, this is just another flavor of the same thing that way. You're going to see the benefit over a much longer period of time on the service revenue line. You will see the benefit in billings much sooner, and that's why we gave that information earlier and you kind of -- Gray you're looking at, that's a very good leading indicator of where service revenue growth is going to go in the future."

And then related to that, given the shortfall on services that we saw in Q2 and the negative impact it had on your free cash flow, should we expect free cash flow to rebound in Q3 and Q4? Or are you assuming the linearity remains unchanged in those quarters?"

I would assume that -- I don't reason assume anything other than we'll still see more of the same, if you will.
And then I think the first part of your question was you asked about low end and about margin. And -- maybe I can offer a little bit of commentary there. When you look at our FortiGate firewall product families, the entry level, the low end, you call it, mid-range and high end. In general, the margins increased -- the gross margin increases as you move up from the entry level to the higher end of it. So from that aspect of it, and that's why the comment in the script that there can be gross margin volatility both from the pricing actions that we've taken and the discounting as well, but also the mix of our product. So in a quarter that we see a higher mix of higher-end firewall shipments, margins will be higher by definition. But there's many puts and takes in there that we -- when we go through the gross margin guidance that we give, hopefully, we're considering all the different puts and takes that are in there, not just the mix of the inventory and the pricing actions."

Revenue for the quarter grew 33%, significantly outpacing the inventory growth rate believe that customer recognition of the exceptional value proposition we provided by a high performance for the ASIC technology and integrate for the U.S. operation system is driving our ability to take cybersecurity market share. 
Product revenue grew very strong at [ 39% ], extending our position as a product revenue leader in the cybersecurity industry. Our product performance reflects the strong demand we have built over the past 18 months across our security solutions along with the successful execution of our internal team in managing the supply chain challenges, 3 growth drivers, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of security and networking and the consolidation of security functionality and vendors together with the opportunity to upsell additional security services to a significant installed base are expected to drive future growth. 
First, the [indiscernible] landscape, including ransomware, continue to expand an evolving targeting company of our size, location and industries. To counter the threat landscape, we are implementing a unique universal [ ZTNA ] at a wide range of customers, driving triple-digit growth for this product and delivering a comprehensive approach to zero trust that is consistent for any user anywhere on any device and supporting today's hybrid workforce; second, for years, Fortinet has lead strategy around convergence of networking and security. 
We estimate the total addressable market for networking and security will increase from $54 billion today to $73 billion in 2026. Convergence accelerate digital transformation and substantially reduce our operation costs and combining networking modernization with dynamic security not spend every part of the network, especially now that many companies are merging [indiscernible] and IOC operation pool. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies, including network firewall segmentation, secure SD-WAN, OT security and 5G in a single operation system, which can be deployed as hardware, software, cloud and as a service. 
Fortinet continues to gain secure SD-WAN market share as our integrated security solution delivers better security, performance and efficiency over more traditional offerings. In the quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings grow over [indiscernible], respectively, and together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. We believe we can achieve #1 market share in SD-WAN in the next couple of years. 
Today, we announced a FortiGate [indiscernible], our latest innovation in converging networking and security, powered by our new [ NP7 ] SPU, the 1000 [indiscernible] delivered 5 to 10x higher performance across 6 major net security functions by consuming 80% less power mass competing solutions. The lower power consumption was a contributing factor in our top 2% ranking in S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. 
Our third growth driver is the consolidation of our vendors and product functionality with [indiscernible] computing power advantage, [indiscernible] can integrate most security function than our competitors, together with over 30 key products ranging from endpoint to network to the cloud security, Fortinet provides our customer with easier operation while lower the management cost and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, we are very focused on upselling value-added security services to a significant customer base. 
According to IDC's second quarter unit share data, Fortinet hold the #1 market share position unit shipped and 43%, up 210 basis points. We expect to reach [ 30% ] market share in the next few years. This leadership position and the substantial installed base creates attractive economy of scale and the opportunity to upsell a security services.

Let's start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, our high",1702,"All right. Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, our highest third quarter sequential growth rate in 11 years. We continue to deliver better-than-industry average top line growth and generate strong profitability. Our operating margin exceeded guide over 28%, driving the adjusted free cash flow margin to 40%. 
Our history as a public company evolved around the Rule of 40 as the combined total of revenue growth and operating margin. Impressively, the Q3 total came in at over 60. We continue to see success in our strategy for expanding further into the large enterprise segment. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 80% to 153 deals. 
The total billings value of deals over $1 million more than doubled driven by a record number of deals over [ $1 ] million and bookings increased over 40%. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid customer across both our core and enhanced platform technologies and the exceptional performance of the team in a challenging supply chain environment. 
We believe the investments we've made in building our platform and our go-to-market engine enables our customers' digital transformation journey. Our platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities while consolidating cybersecurity products, providing security across their entire digital infrastructure while lowering their operating costs. 
Recently, [indiscernible] Wave Enterprise Firewall report acknowledge the success of our investment strategy, placing Fortinet as a leader for the first time in its history. According to Forrester, Fortinet excels the performance for value and a wide array of adjacent services. long known for its bang for the buck approach to network security, Fortinet has built a flexible and capable platform share product the FortiGate firewall. Taking a closer look at the income statement. Product revenue grew 39%. Product revenue growth for our core and enhanced technology platform products increased 29% and 51%, respectively. The product revenue growth rate accelerated over 4 points sequentially, especially impressive given it is our toughest year-over-year comparison in over 10 years. 
Service revenue was up 28%, accelerating 3 points sequentially driven by strong product revenue growth and 7 consecutive quarters that increased our term deferred revenue growth rates. Support and related service revenue was up 28%, accelerating over 2 points sequentially to $311 million. While security subscription service revenue was up 29%, accelerating 4 points sequentially to $370 million. Total revenue in the Americas increased 34%. 
EMEA revenue increased 37% and and APAC posted revenue growth of 23%. Total gross margin at 76.2% exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 61% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Services gross margin of 86.6% was flat year-over-year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. 
Operating margin of 28.3% was up 250 basis points, benefiting from FX and the operating margin leverage that comes with higher revenues. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.4 billion were up 33%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. Core platform billings were up 27% and accounted for 67% of total billings. 
As shown on Slide 6, we entry-level FortiGates posted very strong growth with the mix shifting 16 points in their favor, driven by demand and as we expected, improved supply. Enhanced platform technology billings were up [indiscernible] and accounted for 33% of total billings, a positive mix shift of 3 points. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 29 months. 
Looking at the cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $395 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $464 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. DSOs were down 5 days sequentially while increasing 12 days year-over-year to 75 days. 
Cash taxes were $69 million. Capital expenditures were $88 million, including $69 million for real estate investments. We repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $500 million, bringing the year-to-date total to [indiscernible] at a total cost of $2 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization totals $530 million. Regarding backlog, the backlog at the end of the third quarter was up slightly from the end of the prior quarter, with FortiGate Firewalls accounting for just 1/3 of total backlog. 
We expect fourth quarter ending backlog to be relatively consistent with the third quarter backlog as we are seeing early signs of a transition back to more normalized customer buying behaviors. Moving to guidance. The current environment favors a Fortinet style platform that offers integrated solutions and strong security capabilities and an attractive ownership -- to enhance our ability to capture our share of the large market opportunity, we plan to continue to invest in innovation across our integrated platform offerings. 
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. And to start, as part of the Q4 guidance setting process, we considered several factors, including the greater macro uncertainty today and with it, the increased risk of forecasting the timing of certain larger transactions. 
The transition to more [indiscernible] customers buying behaviors, which means there is less of an emphasis on ordering to get a place online. And for comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2021, when supply was tighter, backlog increased over $120 million and contributed to 49% bookings growth. 
And lastly, elevated year early year top line comparisons that include certain onetime items adding a couple of points of service revenue growth and fully cycling the [indiscernible] acquisition. In response, we have slightly widened our top line guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we expect to again reach the Rule of [ 60 ]. And with that, the key metrics include billings in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.720 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. 
Revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to [ $1.315 ] billion, which represents growth of 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to [indiscernible], non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. 
We expect capital expenditures of $75 million to $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And for the full year, we expect billings and revenue growth to exceed 30% for the second consecutive year. Billings in the range of $5.540 billion to $5.595 billion, which at the midpoint represents [indiscernible], revenue in the range of $4.410 billion to $4.450 billion, which represents growth of 33%. 
Perhaps for context, we should note at the midpoint, these full year billings and revenue growth rates are 3 points higher than the initial growth rates we provided in early February, despite the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, significant increases in interest rates and increasing uncertainty in the macro environment, and importantly, full year backlog is expected to be above the February estimate of $350 million. 
Total service revenue in the range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 42%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% at the midpoint a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. And again, for context, at the midpoint, gross and operating margin expectations were 50 and 100 basis points above the February guide, respectively. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between $800 million and $810 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of $325 million to $335 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be $265 million. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to offer some preliminary thoughts on 2023 and our midterm targets on the heels of a very strong set of growth in 2021 and in 2022. We continue to successfully balance growth and profitability, while investing in longer-term innovation and go-to-market initiatives to future growth. The strength of our business model includes its diversification. Margins that provide capacity for future investment and a rich mix of higher-margin recurring service revenues. 
As we saw in the highs of pandemic, the diversification helps mitigate the risk of economic slowdowns. Specifically, in 2020, we delivered operating margins of nearly 27%, adjusted free cash flow margin of over 38% and top line growth of [indiscernible]. And during the past 12 months, we have really exceeded our target operating margin targets, while increasing our engineering headcount by about 20% and significantly increasing our future sales capacity by over 25%, including a greater than [indiscernible] increase in new nontenured salespeople. 
While we will provide more detailed 2023 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, it's worth leaning this revenue accounts for 60% of total revenue, with gross margins hovering above 85%. We see continued service revenue growth driven by 2 years of very strong product revenue growth and 7 consecutive quarters accelerating short-term deferred revenue growth. 
With a strong business model and the history of being able to execute, we are confident that our momentum will continue and point to our key growth drivers, including strategic investments, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity consolidation. Cyber securities are not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a relatively safe harbor. 
As such, we remain on track to achieve all of our medium-term financial targets from our May 2022 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue in 2025. We each representing a 22% a year CAGR from the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. The targets also included an average non-GAAP operating margin of only 5% for the 4 years from 2022 to 2025. 
And and the 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin in the -- in the mid- to high 30% range, illustrating our long focus for balancing growth and profitability. Our targets remain committed to low-40 or better. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A."

I appreciate breaking down the 3 principal factors that went into that. But I wanted to dig in specifically on the comment you made about normalized buying behavior as it relates to the backlog build. So I think what I inferred from your comments is that while the backlog is going to be sequentially up and sort of higher than what you initially pointed out to be maybe $350 million of ending backlog. 
That's certainly below the $500 million that you were previously telegraphing. So I just wanted to better understand sort of the modulation downward on backlog there and how the sort of normalized behavior contributes to that? And then I'll ask my follow-up."

And I think I'll say a year ago or so that, that was an appropriate behavior when there was a lot of uncertainty around the supply chain and maybe they're planning what we're going to do in 2022. I think that somewhat in general now, and maybe Ken will talk more about this, I think people are getting is that the -- certainly, we are, but the supply chain is a little bit easier to forecast and somewhat easier to manage. I don't mean by any stretch easy, but I do think it easier.

So a lot of customers, sometimes double, triple order try to get ahead of whatever the supply chain issue and and also some of them can easily cancel once they got the product. So that's why we feel probably keeping track in the backlog may not be the best way to forecast the business, and we should be on security, security related, especially driving the future service based on huge FortiGate installation base."

Keeping in mind that we have cracks sometimes or as long as 5 years, that will give you a sense of how long the tailwind may relate to price increases as we will continue to cycle through renewals at old prices and replace them with new contracts. So I think we feel good about the direction of the service revenue and the margins that it provides, together with the fact that it's 60% of our business."

I think that it's growth single digits. So I think that probably gives people a good level of reminder there that our interest in [indiscernible] is a lot to run at the IP and some opportunities that we have there to do things more longer term, if you will. 
In terms of other unique things about product giving the quarter, I mean, I think that as the backlog comes into revenue through the end of 2022 here and certainly into 2023, is tend to provide, again, a fairly significant tailwind to what the product revenue growth will be in 2023, assuming we get the drawn in backlog that we may see."

We do get a tailwind from OpEx from the strength of the U.S. And I think you're seeing that in Q3 and you're seeing that in Q4. 
And probably why it's important is that we've talked for a number of years now around and made reference to 25% operating margin. If you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, it was probably a target to get to 25% operating margin. 
And since then, we've talked about averaging 25%, so I think a floor of 25%. It has certainly served us well as a to help other people understand about how we invest in the business, and as Ken makes reference to it. as we have funds available over that 25% operating margin, it creates opportunities for some all that you're seeing currently of those margin dollars to be reinvested back in innovation and back into our go-to-market strategy."

I think I'll come back to kind of Ken's commentary around backlog, which is really what kind of drives the conversation about bookings. I think a year ago, when we introduced the backlog metric, there was a lot of uncertainty around what the supply chain crisis was going to look like and how it might impact our business and the purpose of providing the backlog disclosure and the booking disclosure then was to kind of round out and help investors understand more about our business model as we go forward. And as we heard in the question earlier from one of the questions, at the beginning of what kind of a -- that kind of swag backlog growth of $350 million in the first quarter and then it came back and said, in the second quarter, we it's going to get closer to $500 million for the full year. And now I think we're looking at a number that's going to be less than that, something in the floor probably seems reasonable from where we're at. 
And I think with net-net, the message there's 2 messages to I think we're becoming much more comfortable with our ability to execute in this environment and maybe some easing in the environment itself. And then secondly, I think that it was always our intention. I think we messaged this that these will be short-term metrics that we provide -- and I think they've served us and our investors well for an extended period of time, but it's probably time now that we feel that we've gotten a better control on it to bring us more -- bring us back online, if you will, with what our industry competitors closing and not disclosing."

Our strategy has been, and Ken alluded to this, is that we came into this technical a year ago, believing that we had a price performance advantage and that we could raise prices and our target was really to pass along most but not all the price increases, call it plus or minus 1% margin. It's kind of our target every quarter. 
It doesn't fall that way every quarter because of various variables. And I would imagine that to the extent that prices can remain to be elevated as we move into 2020, that's kind of the starting point for our price strategy into 2023 as well. Again, because we have not seen signs that we've lost the pro formas advantage. In fact, we continue to win that way. Service is a little bit different. I mean, the largest cost compares is labor. And if you look back, we're a company that has its annual merit increase in the first or second month of the year, so you kind of get a rather immediate both on the COGS line from the compensation increases, which is certainly appropriate -- and then you have to grow the service revenue into it. 
And I think that's part of the conversation about why you saw the reference to sequential margin increases. On the revenue side, it gets fairly complex. -- well, maybe that complex. But thinking through how price increases that started about a year ago and kind of at a quarterly pace, if you will, how those price increases will make their way first on the balance sheet for revenue and to what extent each item is going to reflect all those price increases and then how it will come off the balance sheet in future periods. So you will get from the price increases. And I would expect that, that particular tailwind should continue to, for an extended period of time."

We talked a link of this before you get on the call and for everybody's benefit, I'll just quickly kind of go through it. I think when we got into this conversation a year ago, we felt the backlog, which is really the driver of the bookings conversation was something that we thought was important to investors to understand and be able to track how we're performing as a business and what they're seeing in the drivers. As we've moved forward, I think that if you fast forward a year later, I think we feel more comfortable now about some of the backlog forecasting. And.
Earlier, we made reference that backlog may exit the year, something closer to 400 or a little bit north of that. And so with that in mind, I think we're bringing ourselves back into what I would call industry norms, where nobody else really discloses this information, but we thought it was appropriate for the first year. I would also offer 1 comment about backlog that's important, and we get a lot of conversations around cancellation rates. Our cancellation rate has been extremely consistent at about 4% each and every quarter."

Revenue for the quarter grew 33%, significantly outpacing the inventory growth rate. We believe that customer recognition of the exceptional value proposition we provided by a high performance for the ASIC technology and integrate FortiOS. operation system is driving our ability to take cybersecurity market share.  
Product revenue growth was very strong at 39%, extending our position as a product revenue leader in the cybersecurity industry. Our product revenue performance reflects the strong demand we have built over the past 18 months across our security solutions along with the successful execution of our internal team in managing the supply chain challenges. 3 growth drivers, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of security and networking and the consolidation of security functionality and vendors together with the opportunity to upsell additional security services to a significant installed base are expected to drive future growth.  
First, the threat landscape, including ransomware, continue to expand an evolving targeting company of our size, location and industries. To counter the threat landscape, we are implementing a unique universal ZTNA across a wide range of customers, driving triple-digit growth for this product and delivering a comprehensive approach to zero trust that is consistent for any user anywhere on any device and supporting today's hybrid workforce. 
Second, for years, Fortinet has lead strategy around convergence of networking and security. We estimate the total addressable market for networking and security will increase from $54 billion today to $73 billion in 2026. Convergence accelerate digital transformation and substantially reduce our operation costs and combining networking modernization with dynamic security not [Indiscernible] spend every part of the network, especially now that many companies are merging SOC and IOC operation together. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies, including network firewall segmentation, Secure SD-WAN, OT security and 5G in a single operation system, which can be deployed as hardware, software, cloud and as a service.  
Fortinet continues to gain Secure SD-WAN market share as our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution delivers better security, performance and efficiency over more traditional offerings. In the quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings grow over 45% and 75%, respectively, and together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. We believe we can achieve #1 market share in SD-WAN in the next couple of years.  
Today, we announced a FortiGate 1000F, our latest innovation in converging networking and security, powered by our new NP7 SPU, the 1000F delivered 5 to 10x higher performance across 6 major network security functions by consuming 80% less power versus competitive solutions. The lower power consumption was a contributing factor in our top 2% ranking in S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.  
Our third growth driver is the consolidation of our vendors and product functionality with FortiASIC huge computing power advantage, FortiOS can integrate most security function than our competitors, together with over 30 key products ranging from endpoint to network to the cloud security, Fortinet provides our customer with easier operation while lower the management cost and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, we are very focused on upselling value-added security services to a significant customer base.  
According to IDC's second quarter unit share data, Fortinet hold the #1 market share position for unit shipped and 43%, up 210 basis points. We expect to reach [ 50% ] market share in the next few years. This leadership position and the substantial installed base creates attractive economy of scale and an opportunity to upsell additional security services. 
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work."

Let's start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, our hi",1710,"All right. Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. 
Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, our highest third quarter sequential growth rate in 11 years. We continue to deliver better-than-industry average top line growth and generate strong profitability. Our operating margin exceeded guidance is over 28%, driving the adjusted free cash flow margin to 40%.  
Our history as a public company has revolved around the Rule of 40, measured as the combined total of revenue growth and operating margin. Impressively, the Q3 total came in at over 60. We continue to see success in our strategy for expanding further into the large enterprise segment. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 80% to 153 deals.  
The total billings value of deals over $1 million more than doubled driven by a record number of deals over $5 million. And G2000 bookings increased over 40%. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid customer demand across both our core and enhanced platform technologies and the exceptional performance of the team in a challenging supply chain environment.  
We believe the investments we've made in building our platform and our go-to-market engine enables our customers' digital transformation journey. 
Our platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities while consolidating cybersecurity products, providing security across their entire digital infrastructure while lowering their operating costs.  
Recently, The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Firewalls report acknowledged the success of our investment strategy, placing Fortinet as a leader for the first time in its history. According to Forrester, ""Fortinet excels the performance for value and offers a wide array of adjacent services. Long known for its bang-for-the-buck approach to network security, Fortinet has built a flexible and capable platform with its flagship product, the FortiGate Firewall."" 
Taking a closer look at the income statement. Product revenue grew 39%. Product revenue growth for our core and enhanced technology platform products increased 29% and 51%, respectively. The product revenue growth rate accelerated over 4 points sequentially, especially impressive given it is our toughest year-over-year comparison in over 10 years.  
Service revenue was up 28%, accelerating 3 points sequentially driven by strong product revenue growth and 7 consecutive quarters of increasing short-term deferred revenue growth rates. Support and related service revenue was up 28%, accelerating over 2 points sequentially to $311 million. While security subscription service revenue was up 29%, accelerating 4 points sequentially to $370 million. 
Total revenue in the Americas increased 34%. EMEA revenue increased 37% and APAC posted revenue growth of 23%. Total gross margin at 76.2% exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 61% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Services gross margin of 86.6% was flat year-over-year, but up 70 basis points sequentially.  
Operating margin of 28.3% was up 250 basis points, benefiting from FX and the operating margin leverage that comes with higher revenues. 
Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.4 billion were up 33%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. Core platform billings were up 27% and accounted for 67% of total billings.  
As shown on Slide 6, we entry-level FortiGates posted very strong growth with the mix shifting 16 points in their favor, driven by demand and as we expected, improved supply. Enhanced platform technology billings were up 45% and accounted for 33% of total billings, a positive mix shift of 3 points. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 29 months.  
Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $395 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $464 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. DSOs were down 5 days sequentially while increasing 12 days year-over-year to 75 days.  
Cash taxes were $69 million. Capital expenditures were $88 million, including $69 million for real estate investments. We repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $500 million, bringing the year-to-date totals to 36 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization totals $530 million. 
Regarding backlog, the backlog at the end of the third quarter was up slightly from the end of the prior quarter, with FortiGate Firewalls accounting for just 1/3 of total backlog. We expect fourth quarter ending backlog to be relatively consistent with the third quarter backlog as we are seeing early signs of a transition back to more normalized customer buying behaviors. Moving to guidance. 
Moving to guidance. The current environment favors a Fortinet style platform that offers integrated solutions and strong security capabilities and an attractive cost of ownership. To enhance our ability to capture our share of the large market opportunity, we plan to continue to invest in innovation across our integrated platform offerings.  
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. And to start, as part of the Q4 guidance setting process, we considered several factors, including the greater macro uncertainty today and with it, the increased risk of forecasting the timing of certain larger transactions.  
The transition to more normalized customers buying behaviors, which means there is less of an emphasis on ordering to get a place online. And for comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2021, when supply was tighter, backlog increased over $120 million and contributed to 49% bookings growth.  
And lastly, elevated year early year top line comparisons that include certain onetime items adding a couple of points to service revenue growth and fully cycling the Alaxala acquisition. In response, we have slightly widened our top line guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we expect to again reach the Rule of 60. And with that, the key metrics include billings in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.720 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%.  
Revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.315 billion, which represents growth of 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, which assumes a share count of between 795 million and 805 million.  
We expect capital expenditures of $75 million to $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And for the full year, we expect billings and revenue growth to exceed 30% for the second consecutive year. Billings in the range of $5.540 billion to $5.595 billion, which at the midpoint represents 33%, revenue in the range of $4.410 billion to $4.450 billion, which represents growth of 33%.  
Perhaps for context, we should note at the midpoint, these full year billings and revenue growth rates are 3 points higher than the initial growth rates we provided in early February, despite the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, significant increases in interest rates and increasing uncertainty in the macro environment, and importantly, full year backlog is expected to be above the February estimate of $350 million.  
Total service revenue in the range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 42%. The non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% at the midpoint a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. And again, for context, at the midpoint, gross and operating margin expectations were 50 and 100 basis points above the February guide, respectively.  
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between 800 million and 810 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of $325 million to $335 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be $265 million.  
Before wrapping up, I'd like to offer some preliminary thoughts on 2023 and our midterm targets on the heels of a very strong set of growth in 2021 -- in 2022. We continue to successfully balance growth and profitability, while investing in longer-term innovation and go-to-market initiatives to fuel future growth. The strength of our business model includes its diversification, margins that provide capacity for future investment and a rich mix of higher-margin recurring service revenues.  
As we saw in the highs of pandemic, the diversification helps mitigate the risk of economic slowdowns. Specifically, in 2020, we delivered operating margins of nearly 27%, adjusted free cash flow margin of over 38% and top line growth of 20%. And during the past 12 months, we have really exceeded our operating margin targets, while increasing our engineering headcount by about 20% and significantly increasing our future sales capacity by over 25%, including a greater than 50% increase in new nontenured salespeople.  
While we will provide more detailed 2023 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, it's worth leaning that service revenue accounts for 60% of total revenue, with gross margins hovering above 85%. We see continued service revenue growth driven by 2 years of very strong product revenue growth and 7 consecutive quarters accelerating short-term deferred revenue growth.  
With a strong business model and the history of being able to execute, we are confident that our momentum will continue and point to our key growth drivers, including strategic investments, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity consolidation. Cyber securities are not immune to economic slowdowns -- is expected to remain a relatively safe harbor.  
As such, we remain on track to achieve all of our medium-term financial targets from our May 2022 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue in 2025, each representing a 22% 3 year CAGR from the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. The targets also included an average non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for the 4 years from 2022 to 2025.  
And the 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin in the -- in the mid- to high 30% range. Illustrating our long focus for balancing growth and profitability, our targets remain committed to low-40 or better. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A."

I appreciate you kind of breaking down the 3 principal factors that went into that. But I wanted to dig in specifically on the comment you made about normalized buying behavior as it relates to the backlog build. So I think what I inferred from your comments is that while the backlog is going to be sequentially up and sort of higher than what you initially pointed out to be maybe $350 million of ending backlog. That's certainly below the $500 million that you were previously telegraphing. So I just wanted to better understand sort of the modulation downward on the backlog there and how the sort of normalized buying behavior contributes to that? And then I'll ask my follow-up."

I think when we talk about normalized buying behavior, I think that we certainly saw some enterprise customers in the U.S. doing the supply chain challenges. They were placing orders to get in line -- to hold their place in line for when the inventory is available. 
And I think, say, a year ago or so that, that was an appropriate behavior when there was a lot of uncertainty around the supply chain and maybe they're planning for what we're going to do in 2022. I think that somewhat in general now, and maybe Ken will talk more about this, I think people are getting the sense that the -- certainly, we are -- that the supply chain is a little bit easier to forecast and somewhat easier to manage. I don't mean by any stretch easy, but I do think its easier. 
And with that, I think you're starting to see the market drift back towards the emphasis start to what I would call more traditional buying, which is when they need it, they're placing the order."

And also look at the composition of our backlog, it's only 1/3 or less related to our network security platform, FortiGate, more than half related to like a switch in AP, which is a networking equipment which is kind of an industry problem in the networking side because device tends to be more changeable, more standard driven. 
So a lot of customers, sometimes double, triple order try to get ahead of whatever the supply chain issue and also some of them can easily cancel once they got the product. So that's why we feel probably keeping track in the backlog may not be the best way to forecast the business, and we should be more focused on security, security related, especially driving the future service based on huge FortiGate installation base."

So we're very pleased to see that. I think there's a number of things that are providing a tailwind into that. 
Customer registering units is part of that. I think also the price increase is making its way first into orders and deferred revenue and now into the income statement. Keeping in mind that we have contracts of sometimes or as long as 5 years, that will give you a sense of how long the tailwind may relate to price increases as we will continue to cycle through renewals at old prices and replace them with new contracts. So I think we feel good about the direction of the service revenue and the margins that it provides, together with the fact that it's 60% of our business."

In terms of other unique things about product during the quarter, I mean, I think that as the backlog comes into revenue -- as we go through the end of 2022 here and certainly into 2023, it's going to provide, again, a fairly significant tailwind to what the product revenue growth will be in 2023, assuming we get that drawdown in backlog that we may see."

That's where we're continuing to balance, but if the growth slowed down definitely will be more helping in the margin. So that's why we keeping saying the Rule of 40, probably in the last few quarters, we kind of even reached the Rule of 60 now. So that's where -- also when the growth slowed down and sometimes the service revenue has a higher margin, which can also help in the margin, but we do expect the growth will continue in the next few years with the 3 growth drivers I mentioned and plus additional service revenue to our big installation base, a lot of them are not quite able the security service revenue yet."

On the revenue line, obviously, you can get into certain countries where the pressure on discounting, if you will, because of exchange rates can be a little more intense. But on the OpEx, because 30% of our business is the U.S. and the rest is international. We do get a tailwind from OpEx from the strength of the U.S. dollar. And I think you're seeing that in Q3 and you're seeing that in Q4. 
And probably why it's important is that we've talked for a number of years now around and made reference to 25% operating margin. If you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, it was probably a target to get to 25% operating margin. 
And since then, we've talked about averaging 25%, so I think floor of 25%. It has certainly served us well as a way to help other people understand about how we invest in the business, and as Ken makes reference to it. as we have funds available over that 25% operating margin, it creates opportunities for some, not necessarily all that you're seeing currently of those margin dollars to be reinvested back in innovation and back into our go-to-market strategy."

I think I'll come back to kind of Ken's commentary around backlog, which is really what kind of drives the conversation about bookings. I think a year ago, when we introduced the backlog metric, there was a lot of uncertainty around what the supply chain crisis was going to look like and how it might impact our business and the purpose of providing that -- the backlog disclosure and the booking disclosure then was to kind of round out and help investors understand more about our business model as we go forward. 
And as we heard in the question earlier -- from one of the questions, at the beginning of the year, what kind of swag -- that kind of swag backlog growth of $350 million in the first quarter and then it came back and said, in the second quarter, we it's going to get closer to $500 million for the full year. And now I think we're looking at a number that's going to be less than that, something in the floors probably seems reasonable from where we're at. 
And I think with net-net, the message -- there's 2 messages. So one is I think we're becoming much more comfortable with our ability to execute in this environment and maybe some easing in the environment itself. And then secondly, I think that it was always our intention. I think we messaged this that these would be short-term metrics that we provide. And I think they have served us and our investors well for an extended period of time, but it's probably time now that we feel that we've gotten a better control on it to bring us more -- to bring us back online, if you will, with what our industry competitors are disclosing and not disclosing."

Again, spot on with that. I -- probably a couple -- a little more granularity. I think if you maybe look at it between product gross margin and services gross margin, the product win is the one that's probably more volatile related to what we're seeing. We've certainly heard commentary that maybe things are easing a little bit with the chip manufacturers, but I would say that there's no indication of any sort of cost reduction or savings that are coming from either chip manufacturers or the component suppliers. So we'll see how that plays out. 
Our strategy has been, and Ken alluded to this, is that we came into this economical cycle a year ago, believing that we had a price performance advantage and that we could raise prices and our target was really to pass along most but not all the price increases, call it plus or minus 1% margin. It's kind of our target every quarter. It doesn't fall that way every quarter because of various variables. 
And I would imagine that to the extent that prices can remain to be elevated as we move into 2020, that's kind of the starting point for our pricing strategy into 2023 as well. Again, because we have not seen signs that we've lost the pricing performance advantage. In fact, we continue to win that way. 
Service is a little bit different. I mean, the largest cost components in service is labor. And if you look back, we're a company that has its annual merit increases in the first or second month of the year, so you kind of get a rather immediate jolt on the COGS line from those -- from compensation increases, which is certainly appropriate -- and then you have to grow the service revenue into it. And I think that's part of the conversation about why you saw the reference to sequential margin increases. 
On the revenue side, it gets fairly complex. -- well, maybe not complex. But thinking through how price increases that started about a year ago and kind of at a quarterly pace, if you will, how those price increases will make their way first onto the balance sheet and deferred revenue and to what extent each item is going to reflect all those price increases and then how it will come off the balance sheet in future periods. So you will get tailwind from the price increases. And I would expect that, that particular tailwind should continue to -- for an extended period of time."

The first from day 1 we developed the FortiASIC, which have a huge computing power increase compared to using traditional CPU, but also FortiASIC also working side by side with the CPU. So that's the huge computing power advantage comes from FortiASIC give us more computing power for the FortiOS to run more function, more security function including a lot of networking function. So that advantage is none of our competitors have that. So that's making us keeping driving the market share and also the unit shipment, I mentioned, we like 43% of our market shareholder unit shipment there. 
So that's what we keeping -- give us a long-term growth going forward because also on the convergence of security networking the secure computing power is must have a huge need to address both security and networking function there. Second, the FortiOS is well integrated together with more functions, leveraged security and power. So that's also kind of a huge advantage for us compared to some other competitor, whether they have to use like a different blade or different functions or they have to load some different parts or even to the cloud to address some secure computing power there. And then third one, we also have about 30 different products, mostly home developed and integrate, automate well together. 
So that's also what's helping drive -- we call the vendor Security Fabric, Gartner called a mesh network. So that's also helping the customer to lower the management cost and total cost of ownership.

And earlier, we made reference that backlog may exit the year, something closer to 400 or a little bit north of that. And so with that in mind, I think we're bringing ourselves back into what I would call industry norms, where nobody else really discloses this information, but we thought it was appropriate for the first year. I would also offer 1 comment about backlog that's important, and we get a lot of conversations around cancellation rates. Our cancellation rate has been extremely consistent at about 4% each and every quarter."
