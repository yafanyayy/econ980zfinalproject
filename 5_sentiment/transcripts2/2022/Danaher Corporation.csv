We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlight",2258,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiatives has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses. 
Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution. 
The circumstances over the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead. 
So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all 4 of our platforms. The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers. 
Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, which as the SCIEX XenoToS7600 and triple-quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory. 
Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. For near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand, and it helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. 
And now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter results. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all 3 segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. And geographically, both have developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20% led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% from the full year and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. 
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate. 
Our core revenue growth in our processing businesses continued to outpace segment level results with Cytiva and Pall Biotech, both up more than 25%. Non-COVID related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29% led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near prepandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand that crosses nonrespiratory menu, led by telehealth, hospital-acquired infections and urology testing. 
Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately [ 16 million ] cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV and approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments, while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder. 
Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4%, with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. Now across our water quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. Country delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement, with truly a differentiating combination, which has driven consistent market outperformance. 
In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. 
So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread decline in our customer activity. 
Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools such as daily management and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last 3 quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization. 
Now in Life Sciences. We're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at prepandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest performing end market within the Life Sciences business, while shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. 
Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, and we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics as an important area for future investments. 
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near prepandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screening and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. Molecular diagnostics global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our 4-in-1 combination test, and we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. 
Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million sets for all of 2020. 
In 2021, Cepheid record 10,000 new experts, with total [indiscernible] to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert where the same test cartridges are used on higher and lower throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the mobile market provides our customers with the safety and consistent quality results whether they're at urgent care in the clinic or at the hospital. 
Looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be in an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and solid base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to be there in an endemic. 
So moving on to the applied markets. Customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see a robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and prepandemic rate between 30% and 35%. 
So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long term shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you."

Like you said, it was down 410 here in the quarter. It's probably 3 things. I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter, given obviously, a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio. I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. 
I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more components. And really what's happening is kind of the specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. 
And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower margin business being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. So -- and so I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think teams doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it from what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1, and that's really a result of being able to get through those challenges and still meet customer demand."

It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago",389,"I'll start with, as you know, the situation around COVID is incredibly dynamic, right? It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago, spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. 
The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and eventually having as a result of a step down from to [ 60 to 50 ] in 2022, at 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. 
Now if you think about that going forward beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than prepandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change. It's so dynamic. But we're thinking that, that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. 
So as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then, but that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course, the primary aspect of our total business, continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup."

No, I mean I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4.

No, I mean I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last 6 months, we've been working harder to get that price. And I think you're seeing it show up. I mean it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of, call it, 5, 6 quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. 
As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22, I call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we stand, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see offset by price. 
The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see, and that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some headwinds on share count and lets to sort of I'm thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is that's pretty much in our long-term framework right where we thought. And I think it's also probably important to think about it. But even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of as we navigate the headwinds."

So once again, just to level set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. 
We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street and really driving the growth here. Keep in mind that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the 2-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022."

We acquired SCIEX at that period of time. It turned out to be a fantastic asset. The team has done a wonderful job. Also, if you think about some of the anxiety around Cepheid or the Pall deals there, that has been -- we couldn't be more proud of how the teams have performed there and turn those businesses into really real powerhouses.

Well, let's start off with the why vaccine and therapeutics in the base. And that just comes from our belief of 2 things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world's kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there, and that was discussed at some of the previous questions. 
But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term, I talked about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock solid portfolio that's transformed over the years, that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. 
And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down towards, we'll call it, a more endemic look from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through."

As we look at the markets that we play in or broadly, the impact of those rates could be different. But generally speaking, we see our end markets to be able to perform and drive growth even in a market where we see incrementally higher Fed rates. An example of that would be, if you look at biotech and aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rate in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. 
And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is 1 thing. The specific markets that we play in, we would be less impacted by any of the incremental rate increases that are being discussed."

So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies that don't want to invest their precious cash into manufacturing facilities, and we'll outsource that to CDMOs. And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that just in monoclonal antibodies over the last 5 years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process, and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about. And of course, the customer -- our customers are also CDMOs and we're helping them build those capacities so that they can take care of those developments going forward. 
And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that they're owning the supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost."

I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we go through kind of the next few years.

As we look at 2022, I mentioned the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic bioprocessing business. They'll probably be roughly flat here in 2022. Again, the assumption being that we're starting to see the pandemic going endemic on the one hand. On the other hand, what you start seeing -- you start seeing to happen is, if you will, we're going from 1.0 compounds to 2.0. So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variance, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variance that you have. And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. 
So we think that that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22.

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highligh",2273,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiative has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses.  
Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution.  
The circumstances of the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead, indeed.  
So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all 4 of our platforms. 
The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers.  
Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner, are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory.  
Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. For near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand, and it helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. 
So now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter result. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all 3 segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. And geographically, both the developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20%, led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. 
And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% for the full year, and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher.  
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate.  
Our core revenue growth in our bioprocessing businesses continued to outpace segment-level result, with Cytiva and Pall Biotech both up more than 25%. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021.  
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29%, led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near pre-pandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu, led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and virology testing.  
Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million (sic) [ 19 million ] of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately 60 million cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder.  
Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4% with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. 
Now across our Water Quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment, and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. ChemTreat delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement. It's truly a differentiating combination which has driven consistent market outperformance.  
In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and high-growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread declines in our customer activity.  
Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools, such as daily management, and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last 3 quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization.  
Now in Life Sciences. We're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at pre-pandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation, supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest-performing end market within the Life Sciences business. The shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. 
Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics, as an important area for future investment.  
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near pre-pandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screenings and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions, like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. 
In molecular diagnostics, global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test, further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. And we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. 
Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million tests for all of 2022. 
In 2021, Cepheid placed record 10,000 new GeneXpert systems, bringing the total install base to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. 
The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert, where the same test cartridges are used on higher- and lower-throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the market, provides our customers with the safety and consistent reference lab quality results, whether they're testing in an urgent care clinic or a central hospital lab.  
So now looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and installed base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to gain share in an endemic environment. 
So moving on to the Applied markets. Customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment, and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects and installations that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and pre-pandemic rates between 30% and 35%.  
So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today, and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long-term shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you."

I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter. Given obviously a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio, I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. 
I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at EAS than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more specialized components. And really what's happening is kind of the specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. 
And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower-margin business, being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. 
So -- and so I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think the team's doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it. From what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like, even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1. And that's really a result of being able to get through those challenges and still meet customer demand."

It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta, and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago and spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. 
The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic, and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. 
As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and essentially having, as a result of the step-down from to 60 million to 50 million in 2022, at 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. 
Now if you think about that going forward, beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers, that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than pre-pandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change, it's so dynamic. But we're thinking that, that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. So as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then. But that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. 
And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course the primary aspect of our total business, continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've re-rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup."

And maybe one for Matt. You had some color on the pricing power going forward. I think you called out 150 basis points price in the fourth quarter and throughout the second half or the last 3 quarters. Could you comment on how much further runway do you see in '22, if we continue to be in an inflationary environment, to pass on price to your customers? Any pushback you're seeing yet in any of the end markets? 
And just in general, the comments on the higher fall-through in the business, labor pressure, logistics, obviously in the news a lot. So how are you navigating that this year, and implications for margins for the year?"

No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obvious",390,"Yes. Sure. No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last 6 months, we've been working harder to get that price, and I think you're seeing it show up. I mean, it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of call it, 5, 6 quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. 
As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22 at, call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we've been, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. But I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see, offset by price. 
The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see. And that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some FX headwinds and share count that's how I sort am thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is, is that's pretty much in our long-term framework, right where we thought. 
And I think it's also probably important to think about it, that even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of on -- as we navigate the headwinds here."

So once again, just to level-set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. 
One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street and really driving the growth here. 
Keep in mind, that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the 2-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022."

So I guess first question, I mean, is that reasonable to think there's going to be a healthy step-down? Number one. 
And then number two, the fact that you're including it in the base, just wondering, I know previously you've discussed Cytiva kind of high single digits. Is that still fair, to think about the high single digits, now that you've got vaccine and therapeutics in the base?"

Well, let's start off with the why is vaccine and therapeutics in the base? And that just comes from our belief of 2 things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuing, a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world, kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there. And that was discussed at some of the previous questions. 
But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term and talk about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? 
And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock-solid portfolio that's transformed over the years that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. 
And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID, and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down to what is, we'll call it, a more endemic look, from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. 
Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between, 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through."

So I'm just wondering, could you give a little color on maybe the order book there? Like on the base business, kind of what you're seeing? And are we in like a period of like hyper-investment, where maybe that low double digit could have some upside here over the next couple of years?"

And so could there be upside? Sure, there could be. But of course, we're looking at the order book and -- that's in hand and thinking about how that develops. And we'll continue to update. But for now, low double digits in the non-COVID bioprocessing business is a good planning number."

And example of that would be, if you look at biotech in aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rates in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. 
And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher-growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is 1 thing.

So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies that don't want to invest their precious cash into manufacturing facilities and will outsource that to CDMOs. 
And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that, just in monoclonal antibodies over the last 5 years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there, we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process, and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about. And of course, the customer -- our customers are also CDMOs, and we're helping them build those capacities so that they can take care of those developments going forward. 
And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that there are no supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost."

So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variant, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variant that you have. 
And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. 
So we think that, that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that, that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22. And as we said, we think '23 will look a lot like '22 as well."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highligh",2276,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiative has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses.  
Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution.  
The circumstances of the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead, indeed.  
So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all 4 of our platforms. 
The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers.  
Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner, are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory.  
Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. So near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand and have helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. 
So now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter result. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all 3 segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. Now geographically, both the developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20%, led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. 
And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% for the full year, and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher.  
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate.  
Now core revenue growth in our bioprocessing businesses continued to outpace segment-level results, with Cytiva and Pall Biotech both up more than 25%. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021.  
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29%, led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near pre-pandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu, led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and virology testing.  
Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million (sic) [ 19 million ] of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately 60 million cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder.  
Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4% with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. 
Now across our Water Quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment, and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. ChemTreat delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement. It's truly a differentiating combination which has driven consistent market outperformance.  
In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and high-growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread declines in our customer activity.  
Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools, such as daily management, and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last 3 quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization.  
Now in Life Sciences, we're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at pre-pandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation, supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest-performing end market within the Life Sciences. The shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. 
Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics, as an important area for future investment.  
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near pre-pandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screenings and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions, like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. 
In molecular diagnostics, global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test, further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. And we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. 
Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million tests for all of 2022. 
In 2021, Cepheid placed a record 10,000 new GeneXpert systems, bringing the total install base to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. 
The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert, where the same test cartridges are used on higher- and lower-throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the market, provides our customers with the confidence that they will achieve consistent reference lab quality results, whether they're testing in an urgent care clinic or a central hospital lab.  
So now looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and installed base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to gain share in an endemic environment. 
So moving on to the Applied markets. Customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment, and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects and installations that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and pre-pandemic rates between 30% and 35%.  
So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today, and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long-term shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you."

I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter. Given obviously a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio, I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. 
I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at EAS than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more specialized components. And really what's happening is kind of those specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. 
And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower-margin business, being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. 
So -- and so I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think the team's doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it. From what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like, even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1.

And just is that 50 million testing, does that sort of assume that that's going to be the run rate beyond that? Or do you expect continued sort of deterioration in COVID revenues, offset by other [ in the exit ]?"

It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta, and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago and spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. 
The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic, and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. 
As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and essentially having, as a result of the step-down from to 60 million to 50 million in 2022, a 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. 
Now if you think about that going forward, beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers, that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than pre-pandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change, it's so dynamic. But we're thinking that that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. So as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then. But that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. 
And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course the primary aspect of our total business, continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've re-rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup."

Could you comment on how much further runway do you see in '22, if we continue to be in an inflationary environment, to pass on price to your customers? Any pushback you're seeing yet in any of the end markets? 
And just in general, the comments on the higher fall-through in the business, labor pressure, logistics, obviously in the news a lot. So how are you navigating that this year, and implications for margins for the year?"

No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obvious",390,"Yes. Sure. No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last 6 months, we've been working harder to get that price, and I think you're seeing it show up. I mean, it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of call it, 5, 6 quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. 
As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22 at, call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we've been, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. But I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see, offset by price. 
The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see. And that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some FX headwinds and share count that's how I sort am thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is is that's pretty much in our long-term framework, right where we thought. 
And I think it's also probably important to think about it, that even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of on -- as we navigate the headwinds here."

So once again, just to level-set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. 
One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street and really driving the growth here. 
Keep in mind, that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the 2-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022."

Well, let's start off with the why is vaccine and therapeutics in the base? And that just comes from our belief of 2 things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuing, a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world, kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there. And that was discussed in some of the previous questions. 
But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term and talk about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? 
And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock-solid portfolio that's transformed over the years that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. 
And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID, and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down to what is, we'll call it, a more endemic look, from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. 
Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between, 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through."

And examples of that would be, if you look at biotech in aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rates in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. 
And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher-growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is 1 thing.

And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that, just in monoclonal antibodies over the last 5 years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there, we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process, and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about.

And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that there are no supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost."

But that's certainly the question, I think, we get the most from investors, so I just wanted to circle back on it. 
I mean, it sounds like you feel really good about that underlying base business growing in the low double digits, and then the vaccine piece may be a little bit more of a variable. But can you just talk, I guess, about the trajectory? It sounded like '22 is a decent proxy where maybe COVID comes down and you shake out somewhere in the mid-high single digits as a whole for that kind of $7.5 billion business. 
But I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we go through kind of the next few years. And again, that vaccine piece comes down, but the base business seems like it's good enough to offset that and then some. But just wanted to get a better handle there."

As we look at 2022, I mentioned the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic bioprocessing business, they'll probably be roughly flat here in 2022. Again, the assumption being that we're starting to see the pandemic going endemic on the one hand. 
On the other hand, what you start seeing to happen is, if you will, we're going from 1.0 compounds to 2.0. So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variant, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variant that you have. 
And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. 
So we think that that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that, that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22. And as we said, we think '23 will look a lot like '22 as well."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highligh",2276,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher, capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiative has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses.  
Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution.  
The circumstances of the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead, indeed.  
So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all 4 of our platforms. 
The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers.  
Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner, are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory.  
Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. So near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand and have helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. 
So now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter result. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all 3 segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. Now geographically, both the developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20%, led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. 
And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% for the full year, and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher.  
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate.  
Now core revenue growth in our bioprocessing businesses continued to outpace segment-level results, with Cytiva and Pall Biotech both up more than 25%. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021.  
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29%, led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near pre-pandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu, led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and virology testing.  
Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million (sic) [ 19 million ] of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately 60 million cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder.  
Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4% with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. 
Now across our Water Quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment, and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. ChemTreat delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement. It's truly a differentiating combination which has driven consistent market outperformance.  
In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and high-growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread declines in our customer activity.  
Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools, such as daily management, and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last 3 quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization.  
Now in Life Sciences, we're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at pre-pandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation, supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest-performing end market within the Life Sciences. The shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. 
Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics, as an important area for future investment.  
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near pre-pandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screenings and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions, like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. 
In molecular diagnostics, global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test, further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. And we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. 
Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million tests for all of 2022. 
In 2021, Cepheid placed a record 10,000 new GeneXpert systems, bringing the total install base to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. 
The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert, where the same test cartridges are used on higher- and lower-throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the market, provides our customers with the confidence that they will achieve consistent reference lab quality results, whether they're testing in an urgent care clinic or a central hospital lab.  
So now looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and installed base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to gain share in an endemic environment. 
So moving on to the Applied markets. Customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment, and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects and installations that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and pre-pandemic rates between 30% and 35%.  
So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today, and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long-term shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you."

I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter. Given obviously a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio, I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. 
I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at EAS than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more specialized components. And really what's happening is kind of those specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. 
And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower-margin business, being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. 
So -- and so I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think the team's doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it. From what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like, even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1. And that's really a result of being able to get through those challenges and still meet customer demand."

It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta, and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago and spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. 
The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic, and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. 
As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and essentially having, as a result of the step-down from to 60 million to 50 million in 2022, a 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. 
Now if you think about that going forward, beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers, that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than pre-pandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change, it's so dynamic. But we're thinking that that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. So as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then. But that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. 
And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course the primary aspect of our total business, continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've re-rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup."

Any pushback you're seeing yet in any of the end markets?

No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obvious",390,"Yes. Sure. No, I mean, I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last 6 months, we've been working harder to get that price, and I think you're seeing it show up. I mean, it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of call it, 5, 6 quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. 
As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22 at, call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we've been, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. But I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see, offset by price. 
The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see. And that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some FX headwinds and share count that's how I sort am thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is is that's pretty much in our long-term framework, right where we thought. 
And I think it's also probably important to think about it, that even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of on -- as we navigate the headwinds here."

So once again, just to level-set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. 
One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street and really driving the growth here. 
Keep in mind, that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the 2-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022."

Well, let's start off with the why is vaccine and therapeutics in the base? And that just comes from our belief of 2 things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuing, a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world, kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there. And that was discussed in some of the previous questions. 
But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term and talk about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? 
And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock-solid portfolio that's transformed over the years that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. 
And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID, and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down to what is, we'll call it, a more endemic look, from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. 
Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between, 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through."

As we look at the markets that we play in more broadly, the impact of those rates could be different. But generally speaking, we see our end market to be able to perform and drive growth even in a market where we see incrementally higher Fed rates. 
And examples of that would be, if you look at biotech in aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rates in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. 
And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher-growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is 1 thing. The specific markets that we play in, we would see less impacted by any of the incremental rate increases that are being discussed."

So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies",311,"Sure. Well, let me characterize that a little bit. So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies that don't want to invest their precious cash into manufacturing facilities and will outsource that to CDMOs. 
And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that, just in monoclonal antibodies over the last 5 years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there, we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process, and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about. And of course, the customer -- our customers are also CDMOs, and we're helping them build those capacities so that they can take care of those developments going forward. 
And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that there are no supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost."

I know you touched a little bit about what the cadence could look like going forward. But that's certainly the question, I think, we get the most from investors, so I just wanted to circle back on it. 
I mean, it sounds like you feel really good about that underlying base business growing in the low double digits, and then the vaccine piece may be a little bit more of a variable. But can you just talk, I guess, about the trajectory? It sounded like '22 is a decent proxy where maybe COVID comes down and you shake out somewhere in the mid-high single digits as a whole for that kind of $7.5 billion business. 
But I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we go through kind of the next few years. And again, that vaccine piece comes down, but the base business seems like it's good enough to offset that and then some. But just wanted to get a better handle there."

As we look at 2022, I mentioned the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic bioprocessing business, they'll probably be roughly flat here in 2022. Again, the assumption being that we're starting to see the pandemic going endemic on the one hand. 
On the other hand, what you start seeing to happen is, if you will, we're going from 1.0 compounds to 2.0. So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variant, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variant that you have. 
And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. 
So we think that that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that, that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22. And as we said, we think '23 will look a lot like '22 as well."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We're off to a good start in 2022 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environmen",1927,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 
We're off to a good start in 2022 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our 3 segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bioprocessing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gain. 
Now clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team's commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. And it's this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provide a strong foundation for the future. 
So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter, and we delivered 12% of core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% and with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%. Geographically, Revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single digits. China declined low single digits but was up high single digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19 driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we're seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June. 
Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The -- the operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. 
So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Let's start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we're seeing very robust activity levels, customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single digits and was up low double digits, excluding the impact of that significant onetime project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy, and we continue to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter. 
Now over the last 2 years, our customers prioritize the development of COVID-19 vaccine and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers' core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities. Notably, monoclonal antibody-based therapies or MABT, cell and gene therapy and mRNA-based technology. In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they're becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel MABT in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment. Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets. 
Now we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology, which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologics and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plan dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing are critical to support our customers' demand today. Long term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest-growing product categories within bioprocessing. 
So turning to our Life Sciences Instrument businesses, we're seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical CRO, and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects. In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory. At Leica Microsystems, Mika is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mika integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we're investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position. 
Aldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen event which focused on increasing throughput further reducing lead times are already generating terrific results. So we're excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing. 
So now let's move to Diagnostics, where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5% led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid-single digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strength in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology. The clinical diagnostic market volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures, allowing them to continue providing critical health care services. Now in China, we're currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter. 
In Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong, and we believe we're taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care. So as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we're seeing increased demand for Cepheid's broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market-leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions. 
Now respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid's 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%. 
So now let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including HACH water quality and mid-single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end market. Equipment order rate also remains strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects. 
Now Product Identification, our marking and coding business was up high single digits, partially offset by a slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets. 
So stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning both from a cost and growth perspective. While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We're also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult to source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors. 
Now our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market, innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and HACH's HQ series portable meters, are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we're seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid-single digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS. 
So we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools, paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage. 
So now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth. 
So to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today's dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, John."

We suffered from some absenteeism related to the Omicron outbreak in our manufacturing plant. And that affected the production levels on the one hand. On the other hand, the mix shift, larger than anticipated towards the 4-in-1 test, 65% versus our assumption of 50% ended up resulting in a beat in terms of revenue. So really a short-term contained issue that affected manufacturing volumes, ultimately, the mix and the strength of the team's recovery ended up resulting in the 17 million cartridges of shipment. 
Now if we switch gears briefly and go to the topic of stockpiling, we are very, very sensitive to this particular topic. and stay extremely close with our customers. As an example, in the first quarter, Cepheid continues to be sold out. If you think about bioprocessing, this is an area where there continues to be in the industry manufacturing constraints. So we are very, very close to our customers, working together with them with their manufacturing schedules to ensure that we're able to not only meet their needs but also to ensure that we don't have inventory build up in the system. So could there be pockets of that perhaps on the margin, but generally speaking, we don't see a significant buildup in the supply chain."

So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low",724,"Well, thanks, Vijay. So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low double digits here in Q1. Very, very strong order activity, and I'll come back to that in a minute. Now if you look at our first quarter last year, our sales were up over 70%. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we're in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. In fact, we still think that we're taking share there. So that's sort of one marker that I want you to have. 
And then the second point is the order activity continues to be very, very strong. Last year, our orders in the first quarter were up over 90%. And so we anticipated that our orders in Q1 of this year would be down -- but nonetheless, we continue to build backlog here in Q1 as well in the bioprocessing area. And this is why we're so confident in our core growth guide here for the year and bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we're seeing and the backlog that we have, that's really important. 
So now let's unpack that a little bit and think about what's going on and why COVID is sort of one variable, but that there are other variables here that are incredibly important and explain why we talk about the bioprocessing business and its growth in aggregate. So first of all, as you think about the activity levels outside of COVID in the bioprocessing business, it's important to see what's going on in clinical trials. And I've talked about this, but you know that the project pipeline for monoclonal antibodies is 50% larger today than it was 5 years ago. For cell and gene therapy, it's 10x larger, driving extraordinary activity here in the clinical trial area. And what you see, and as I mentioned in the opening comments, you see customers really starting to focus on these new projects across all modalities and not just allocating the resources to COVID, but to these new modalities. So that's really important to note that customer activity level continues to be very, very high, and that plays through in the clinical trials. 
Now another point to take here is monoclonal antibodies are becoming the standard of care and the predominant class of biologic drugs. So what's going on in monoclonal antibodies is the primary growth driver in the market and also for our business and recently launched products that are ramping to new treatment and new indications are driving an exceptional amount of volume here. And then you add to that, that emerging markets and high-growth markets, such as China and India, are starting to have access to these monoclonal antibody treatments that provides additional and significant volume leverage. 
At the same time, you have biosimilar growth, Vijay. So these biosimilars are leveraging the fact that some of the biologic drugs, monoclonal antibody that are higher volume are starting to come off patent, and that's increasing the penetration of those drugs throughout the world where the penetration has been lower. And that's providing another growth impetus. And then lastly, I'll start with this now. We've been talking about single-use technology and their adoption for a while, which is an additional leverage growth vector within the bioprocessing business. So all that helped the activity that we talked about provides for volume, but SUT on top of that is substituting more traditional technologies and is growing even faster. And we have well over $1 billion of single-use technology. And we've just announced that our third new plant coming on for single-use technologies in Cardiff, Wales. So we feel very confident on the basis of what's going on outside of COVID. And that's why we look at it together because it's the aggregate that we look at and that really ultimately count that, that will drive that high single-digit, low double-digit growth here for 2022 and also supports our high single-digit perspective beyond that."

I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference. I think -- from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that $35 million to $40 million that we normally talk to in this 25, it was all FX, right? So in the quarter, I mean you think about it, it was kind of like a $0.07 headwind here for us. So I don't think we saw anything. Obviously, supply chain is what it is, but I think we were able to kind of work our way through that. I really think it was all FX here in the quarter and first quarter. 
As far as -- I think you bring up a good point then as far as the full year goes, so I would say there's no change to the full year fall through other than the FX impact that we're seeing. And just to kind of lay that out. We continue to expect mid-single-digit core growth from kind of the core and acquisitions, and that will have that 35% to 40% fall through. In January, we thought that FX was going to bring that 35% to 40% down to, say, 30% to 35%. But given the currency moves we've seen since January, as we sit here today, I think it's going to be more like 20%, 25% fall-through for the year versus the 30 million to 35 million that we sort of guided to the last time. So look, it still leaves us, if we deliver that, that still leaves low single-digit EPS growth for the year despite what I think is some pretty significant FX headwinds year-over-year. 
And maybe just to give you a color on the sizing of that headwind, I mean right now, FX is going to be a $0.35 EPS headwind year-over-year, and that's a pretty meaningful number for us here during the year. It's probably half of what we initially thought. So -- it's a pretty big headwind here for the year, and it was a little bit here in the quarter, too."

And let me start off with the fact that there are inflationary pressures out there. We've talked about that in the past. And that moves from sort of the classic topics of memory chips and other types of chipsets and freight and perhaps labor to seeing more broadly inflation. But nonetheless, with the Danaher Business System, our teams have been able to do a number of things here in order to contain this. One, of course, is related to ensuring the robustness of the supply. Many of our businesses today are gaining share because we are able to continue our supply, have shorter lead times because we're able to access and secure the components necessary to drive our manufacturing in our business. So it's an important aspect to this entire equation of growth and share gain. 
Secondly, the DBS tool set that we have been putting in place are also helping us offset costs in the sense, and as I mentioned in the introductory comments that, look, we are able to now reengineer more quickly to other types of -- again, I'll use the example of chipsets to next-gen chip set more broadly consolidate those and not only gain supply, but then also reduce our costs. So there's an entire DBS machine, if you will, that is driving to secure supply and to offset costs. 
At the same time, of course, we're driving price, and we see strong traction there. In fact, we're well over 200 basis points of price here in the first quarter, and that's a quarter that still had a fair amount of, if you will, 2021 backlog in it. right? So we have now worked through the majority of that backlog and expect to see continued momentum there. So thinking about price at these levels of 200-plus basis points, that's the right way to think about that. And it's just another testament to the strength of our portfolio, the degree of differentiation of our product and the leverage that this razor/razor blade business model provides us with 75% consumables, many of which are specked in or keyed into the equipment or instruments that they supply."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today.We're off to a good start in 2022, with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environmen",1923,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.
We're off to a good start in 2022, with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our 3 segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bioprocessing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gain.
Now clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team's commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable, secular growth drivers. And it's this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for the future.
So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter, and we delivered 12% core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%.
Geographically, revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single digits. China declined low single digits but was up high single digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19-driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we're seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June.
Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.
So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Let's start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we're seeing very robust activity levels. Customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single digits and was up low double digits, excluding the impact of that significant onetime project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy, and we continue to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter.
Now over the last 2 years, our customers prioritized the development of COVID-19 vaccine and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers' core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities, notably, monoclonal antibody-based therapies, or mAbs, cell and gene therapy and mRNA-based technology.
In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they're becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel mAbs in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment.
Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher-volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets.
Now we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers' accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology, which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologics and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plant, dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology, came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing, are critical to support our customers' demand today. Long term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest-growing product categories within bioprocessing.
So turning to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. We're seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical CRO and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects.
In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems, IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory.
At Leica Microsystems, Mica is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mica integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we're investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position.
Aldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and in putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen events, which focused on increasing throughput and further reducing lead times, are already generating terrific results. So we're excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing.
So now let's move to Diagnostics where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5%, led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid-single digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strengths in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology.
In clinical diagnostic market, volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures, allowing them to continue providing critical health care services. Now in China, we're currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter.
In Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong, and we believe we're taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care.
So as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we're seeing increased demand for Cepheid's broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market-leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions.
Now respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid's 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter, with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%.
So now let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including [ Hach ] water quality and mid-single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth. Accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end market. Equipment order rate also remains strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects.
Now product identification, our marking and coding business was up high single digits, partially offset by a slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets. So stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning, both from a cost and growth perspective.
While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We're also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult-to-source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors.
Now our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market. Innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and Hach's HQ series portable meters are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face, from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we're seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid-single digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS.
So we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage.
So now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
So to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses, where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today's dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term, competitive advantage.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, John."

Well, let's start off with the cartridge shipments here in the first quarter. Early in the quarter, as many, we suffered from some absenteeism related to the Omicron outbreak in our manufacturing plants. And that affected the production levels, on the one hand. On the other hand, the mix shift, larger than anticipated towards the 4-in-1 test, 65% versus our assumption of 50%, ended up resulting in a beat in terms of revenue. So really a short-term contained issue that affected manufacturing volumes. Ultimately, the mix and the strength of the team's recovery ended up resulting in the 17 million cartridges of shipment.
Now if we switch gears briefly and go to the topic of stockpiling, we are very, very sensitive to this particular topic and stay extremely close with our customers. As an example, in the first quarter, Cepheid continued to be sold out. If you think about bioprocessing, this is an area where there continues to be in the industry manufacturing constraints. So we are very, very close to our customers, working together with them, with their manufacturing schedules to ensure that we're able to not only meet their needs but also to ensure that we don't have inventory buildup in the system. So could there be pockets of that perhaps on the margin, but generally speaking, we don't see a significant buildup in the supply chain."

265621,1775185314,2540893,"Danaher Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2022",2022-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, Vijay. So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, if we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up",726,"Well, thanks, Vijay. So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, if we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low double digits here in Q1. Very, very strong order activity, and I'll come back to that in a minute.
Now if you look at our first quarter last year, our sales were up over 70%. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we're in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. In fact, we still think that we're taking share there. So that's sort of one marker that I want you to have.
And then the second point is the order activity continues to be very, very strong. Last year, our orders in the first quarter were up over 90%. And so we anticipated that our orders in Q1 of this year would be down, but nonetheless, we continue to build backlog here in Q1 as well in the bioprocessing area. And this is why we're so confident in our core growth guide here for the year in bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we're seeing and the backlog that we have, that's really important.
So now let's unpack that a little bit and think about what's going on and why COVID is sort of one variable, but that there are other variables here that are incredibly important and explain why we talk about the bioprocessing business and its growth in aggregate.
So first of all, if you think about the activity levels outside of COVID in the bioprocessing business, it's important to see what's going on in clinical trials. And I've talked about this, but you know that the project pipeline for monoclonal antibodies is 50% larger today than it was 5 years ago. For cell and gene therapy, it's 10x larger, driving extraordinary activity here in the clinical trial area. And what you see, and as I mentioned in the opening comments, you see customers really starting to focus on these new projects across all modalities and not just allocating the resources to COVID but to these new modalities. So that's really important to note that customer activity level continues to be very, very high, and that plays through in the clinical trials.
Now another point to take here is monoclonal antibodies are becoming the standard of care and the predominant class of biologic drugs. So what's going on in monoclonal antibodies is the primary growth driver in the market and also for our business. And recently launched products that are ramping to new treatments and new indications are driving an exceptional amount of volume here. And then you add to that, that emerging markets and high-growth markets such as China and India are starting to have access to these monoclonal antibody treatments. That provides additional and significant volume leverage.
At the same time, you have biosimilar growth, Vijay. So these biosimilars are leveraging the fact that some of the biologic drugs, monoclonal antibodies that are higher volume are starting to come off patent, and that's increasing the penetration of those drugs throughout the world where the penetration has been lower. And that's providing another growth impetus.
And then lastly, and I'll stop with this now, we've been talking a lot about single-use technology and their adoption for a while, which is an additional leverage growth vector within the bioprocessing business. So all that helps the activity that we talked about provides for volume, but SUT on top of that is substituting more traditional technologies and is growing even faster. And we have well over $1 billion of single-use technology. And we've just announced our third new plant coming on for single-use technologies in Cardiff, Wales.
So we feel very confident on the basis of what's going on outside of COVID. And that's why we look at it together because it's the aggregate that we look at and that really ultimately count that, that will drive that high single-digit, low double-digit growth here for 2022 and also supports our high single-digit perspective beyond that."

No, for Q1, I mean, we kind of came through about 25%. I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference. I think from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that 35% to 40% that we normally talk to",357,"Yes. No, for Q1, I mean, we kind of came through about 25%. I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference. I think from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that 35% to 40% that we normally talk to in this 25%, it was all FX, right? So in the quarter, I mean you think about it, it was kind of like a $0.07 headwind here for us. So I don't think we saw anything. Obviously, supply chain is what it is, but I think we were able to kind of work our way through that. I really think it was all FX here in the quarter, in the first quarter.
As far as -- and I think you bring up a good point then as far as the full year goes. So I would say there's no change to the full year fall-through other than the FX impacts that we're seeing. And just to kind of lay that out, we continue to expect mid-single-digit core growth from kind of the core and acquisitions, and that will have that 35% to 40% fall-through. In January, we thought that FX was going to bring that 35% to 40% down to, say, 30% to 35%. But given the currency moves we've seen since January, as we sit here today, I think it's going to be more like 20%, 25% fall-through for the year versus the 30% to 35% that we sort of guided to the last time. So look, it still leaves us -- if we deliver that, that still leaves us with low single-digit EPS growth for the year despite what I think is some pretty significant FX headwinds year-over-year.
And maybe just to give you a color on the sizing of that headwind. I mean, right now, FX is going to be a $0.35 EPS headwind year-over-year, and that's a pretty meaningful number for us here during the year. It's probably half of what we initially thought. So it's a pretty big headwind here for the year, and it was a little bit here in the quarter, too."

And",382,"Scott, we have been working price directly and indirectly, and we're seeing very good traction. Let me lay that out for you here. And let me start off with the fact that there are inflationary pressures out there. We've talked about that in the past. And that moves from sort of the classic topics of memory chips and other types of chipsets and freight and perhaps labor to seeing more broadly inflation. But nonetheless, with the Danaher Business System, our teams have been able to do a number of things here in order to contain this. One, of course, is related to ensuring the robustness of the supply. Many of our businesses today are gaining share because we are able to continue our supply, have shorter lead times because we're able to access and secure the components necessary to drive our manufacturing in our business. So it's an important aspect to this entire equation of growth and share gain.
Secondly, the DBS tool sets that we have been putting in place are also helping us offset costs in the sense, and as I mentioned in the introductory comments that, look, we are able to now reengineer more quickly to other types of -- again, I'll use the example of chipsets, to next-gen chipsets more broadly, consolidate those and not only gain supply but then also reduce our costs. So there's an entire DBS machine, if you will, that is driving to secure supply and to offset costs.
At the same time, of course, we're driving price, and we see strong traction there. In fact, we're well over 200 basis points of price here in the first quarter, and that's a quarter that still had a fair amount of, if you will, 2021 backlog in it, right? So we have now worked through the majority of that backlog and expect to see continued momentum there.
So thinking about price at these levels of 200-plus basis points, that's the right way to think about that. And it's just another testament to the strength of our portfolio, the degree of differentiation of our product and the leverage that this razor/razor blade business model provides us with 75% consumables, many of which are specked in or keyed in to the equipment or instruments that they supply."

The first thing is the leadership and the team at Aldevron that is pulling and open to applying the Danaher Business System as fast as possible to fortify their competitive advantage in lead times, in quality and to ensure that we drive this business to the growth of its potential. And we think for 2022, we continue to think that the $500 million revenue number is a good number, 40% in Q1.

I've talked to those, the SCIEX, the ZenoTOF, the accurate mAbs instrument as well as the 7500 Triple Quad.

And the COVID business, it will do what it does, but that variation is within the realm of what we have been casting as the overall growth rate of the business. And so you take the backlog, which continues to grow quarter-over-quarter, and you take the growth drivers that I've laid out, that is what supports the high single-digit, low double-digit growth for 2022 and the high single-digit longer-term growth guide that we've talked about."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today.We're off to a good start in 2022, with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environmen",1925,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.
We're off to a good start in 2022, with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our 3 segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bioprocessing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gain.
Now clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team's commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable, secular growth drivers. And it's this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for the future.
So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter, and we delivered 12% core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%.
Geographically, revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single digits. China declined low single digits but was up high single digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19-driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we're seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June.
Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.
So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Let's start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we're seeing very robust activity levels. Customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single digits and was up low double digits, excluding the impact of that significant onetime project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy, and we continue to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter.
Now over the last 2 years, our customers prioritized the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers' core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities, notably, monoclonal antibody-based therapies, or mAbs, cell and gene therapy and mRNA-based technology.
In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they're becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel mAbs in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment.
Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher-volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets.
Now we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers' accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology, which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologics and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plant, dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology, came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing, are critical to support our customers' demand today. Long term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest-growing product categories within bioprocessing.
So turning to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. We're seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical, CRO and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects.
In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems, IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory.
At Leica Microsystems, Mica is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mica integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we're investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position.
Aldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and is putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen events, which focused on increasing throughput and further reducing lead times, are already generating terrific results. So we're excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing.
So now let's move to Diagnostics where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5%, led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid-single digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strengths in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology.
In clinical diagnostic market, volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures, allowing them to continue providing critical health care services. Now in China, we're currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter.
In Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong, and we believe we're taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care.
So as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we're seeing increased demand for Cepheid's broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market-leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions.
Now respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid's 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter, with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%.
So now let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including [ Hach ]
[Audio Gap]
Water quality and mid-single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth. Accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end markets. Equipment order rate also remains strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects.
Now product identification, our marking and coding business was up high single digits, partially offset by a slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets. So stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning, both from a cost and growth perspective.
While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We're also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult-to-source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors.
Now our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market. Innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and Hach's HQ series portable meters are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face, from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we're seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid-single digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS.
So we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage.
So now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
So to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses, where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today's dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term, competitive advantage.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, John."

Well, let's start off with the cartridge shipments here in the first quarter. Early in the quarter, as many, we suffered from some absenteeism related to the Omicron outbreak in our manufacturing plants. And that affected the production levels, on the one hand. On the other hand, the mix shift, larger than anticipated towards the 4-in-1 test, 65% versus our assumption of 50%, ended up resulting in a beat in terms of revenue. So really a short-term contained issue that affected manufacturing volumes. Ultimately, the mix and the strength of the team's recovery ended up resulting in the 17 million cartridges of shipment.
Now if we switch gears briefly and go to the topic of stockpiling, we are very, very sensitive to this particular topic and stay extremely close with our customers. As an example, in the first quarter, Cepheid continued to be sold out. If you think about bioprocessing, this is an area where there continues to be in the industry manufacturing constraints. So we are very, very close to our customers, working together with them, with their manufacturing schedules to ensure that we're able to not only meet their needs but also to ensure that we don't have inventory buildup in the system. So could there be pockets of that? Perhaps on the margin, but generally speaking, we don't see a significant buildup in the supply chain."

265621,1775185314,2548866,"Danaher Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2022",2022-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, Vijay. So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, if we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up",726,"Well, thanks, Vijay. So let's just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, if we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low double digits here in Q1. Very, very strong order activity, and I'll come back to that in a minute.
Now if you look at our first quarter last year, our sales were up over 70%. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we're in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. In fact, we still think that we're taking share there. So that's sort of one marker that I want you to have.
And then the second point is the order activity continues to be very, very strong. Last year, our orders in the first quarter were up over 90%. And so we anticipated that our orders in Q1 of this year would be down, but nonetheless, we continue to build backlog here in Q1 as well in the bioprocessing area. And this is why we're so confident in our core growth guide here for the year in bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we're seeing and the backlog that we have, that's really important.
So now let's unpack that a little bit and think about what's going on and why COVID is sort of one variable, but that there are other variables here that are incredibly important and explain why we talk about the bioprocessing business and its growth in aggregate.
So first of all, if you think about the activity levels outside of COVID in the bioprocessing business, it's important to see what's going on in clinical trials. And I've talked about this, but you know that the project pipeline for monoclonal antibodies is 50% larger today than it was 5 years ago. For cell and gene therapy, it's 10x larger, driving extraordinary activity here in the clinical trials area. And what you see, and as I mentioned in the opening comments, you see customers really starting to focus on these new projects across all modalities and not just allocating the resources to COVID but to these new modalities. So that's really important to note that customer activity level continues to be very, very high, and that plays through in the clinical trials.
Now another point to take here is monoclonal antibodies are becoming the standard of care and the predominant class of biologic drugs. So what's going on in monoclonal antibodies is the primary growth driver in the market and also for our business. And recently launched products that are ramping to new treatments and new indications are driving an exceptional amount of volume here. And then you add to that, that emerging markets and high-growth markets such as China and India are starting to have access to these monoclonal antibody treatments. That provides additional and significant volume leverage.
At the same time, you have biosimilar growth, Vijay. So these biosimilars are leveraging the fact that some of the biologic drugs, monoclonal antibodies that are higher volume are starting to come off patent, and that's increasing the penetration of those drugs throughout the world where the penetration has been lower. And that's providing another growth impetus.
And then lastly, and I'll stop with this now, we've been talking a lot about single-use technology and their adoption for a while, which is an additional leverage growth vector within the bioprocessing business. So all that helps the activity that we talked about provides for volume, but SUT on top of that is substituting more traditional technologies and is growing even faster. And we have well over $1 billion of single-use technology. And we've just announced our third new plant coming on for single-use technologies in Cardiff, Wales.
So we feel very confident on the basis of what's going on outside of COVID. And that's why we look at it together because it's the aggregate that we look at and that really ultimately count that, that will drive that high single-digit, low double-digit growth here for 2022 and also supports our high single-digit perspective beyond that."

No, for Q1, I mean, we kind of came through about 25%. I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference.

I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference. I think from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that 35% to 40% that we normally talk to and this 25%, it was all FX, right? So in the quarter, I mean you think about it, it was kind of like a $0.07 headwind here for us. So I don't think we saw anything -- obviously, supply chain is what it is, but I think we were able to kind of work our way through that. I really think it was all FX here in the quarter, in the first quarter.
As far as -- and I think you bring up a good point then as far as the full year goes. So I would say there's no change to the full year fall-through other than the FX impacts that we're seeing. And just to kind of lay that out, we continue to expect mid-single-digit core growth from kind of the core and acquisitions, and that will have that 35% to 40% fall-through. In January, we thought that FX was going to bring that 35% to 40% down to, say, 30% to 35%. But given the currency moves we've seen since January, as we sit here today, I think it's going to be more like 20%, 25% fall-through for the year versus the 30% to 35% that we sort of guided to the last time. So look, it still leaves us -- if we deliver that, that still leaves us with low single-digit EPS growth for the year despite what I think is some pretty significant FX headwinds year-over-year.
And maybe just to give you a color on the sizing of that headwind. I mean, right now, FX is going to be a $0.35 EPS headwind year-over-year, and that's a pretty meaningful number for us here during the year. It's probably half of what we initially thought. So it's a pretty big headwind here for the year, and it was a little bit here in the quarter, too."

And",382,"Scott, we have been working price directly and indirectly, and we're seeing very good traction. Let me lay that out for you here. And let me start off with the fact that there are inflationary pressures out there. We've talked about that in the past. And that moves from sort of the classic topics of memory chips and other types of chipsets and freight and perhaps labor to seeing more broadly inflation. But nonetheless, with the Danaher Business System, our teams have been able to do a number of things here in order to contain this. 
One, of course, is related to ensuring the robustness of the supply. Many of our businesses today are gaining share because we are able to continue our supply, have shorter lead times because we're able to access and secure the components necessary to drive our manufacturing in our business. So it's an important aspect to this entire equation of growth and share gain.
Secondly, the DBS tool sets that we have been putting in place are also helping us offset costs in the sense, and as I mentioned in the introductory comments that, look, we are able to now reengineer more quickly to other types of -- again, I'll use the example of chipsets, to next-gen chipsets more broadly, consolidate those and not only gain supply but then also reduce our costs. So there's an entire DBS machine, if you will, that is driving to secure supply and to offset costs.
At the same time, of course, we're driving price, and we see strong traction there. In fact, we're well over 200 basis points of price here in the first quarter, and that's a quarter that still had a fair amount of, if you will, 2021 backlog in it, right? So we have now worked through the majority of that backlog and expect to see continued momentum there.
So thinking about price at these levels of 200-plus basis points, that's the right way to think about that. And it's just another testament to the strength of our portfolio, the degree of differentiation of our product and the leverage that this razor/razor blade business model provides us with 75% consumables, many of which are specked in or keyed in to the equipment or instruments that they supply."

And as you think about COVID within that, COVID's going to do what it does, but there is a larger market that is growing rapidly. And we're going to continue to see fluctuation as it relates to COVID volumes, whether there's a decision on booster shots for different age groups, whether it becomes part of an annualized immunization regimen. All of these are open questions.

The first thing is the leadership and the team at Aldevron that is pulling and open to applying the Danaher Business System as fast as possible to fortify their competitive advantage in lead times, in quality and to ensure that we drive this business to the growth of its potential. And we think for 2022, we continue to think that the $500 million revenue number is a good number, 40% in Q1.

And so we do expect to work through the shutdowns here in the second quarter. Again, that was the 200 to 300 basis point headwind that we included in our Q2 guide of mid-single digits.

265621,1787602462,2602013,"Danaher Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2022",2022-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let me start with we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-base",2165,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let me start with we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. And we were particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits and believe we gained market share in many of our businesses. 
Now these results are a testament to our team's strong commitment to executing in a challenging operating environment. They've done an incredible job leveraging the Danaher Business System to help mitigate supply chain constraints, manage inflationary pressures and improve our competitive positioning with impactful new innovation. 
Our second quarter results also highlights the strength and resilience of the businesses that make up Danaher today. Our portfolio is comprised of leading franchises positioned in attractive end markets with strong secular growth drivers, all united by a common set of durable business models. In fact, nearly 75% of our revenues today are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into highly regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. On top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. 
We believe this powerful combination of our talented team and the strength of our portfolio all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. 
So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in a little more detail. Sales were $7.8 billion, and we delivered 9.5% core revenue growth, including 8% growth in our base business with strong contributions from all 4 of our operating platforms. COVID-19 testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. 
Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low double digits with broad-based strength across North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up mid-single digits, including impressive high single-digit growth in China. 
Our results in China significantly exceeded our expectations, which is particularly notable as lockdowns continued for longer than we anticipated. So now I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our associates in China for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during such a challenging time. To the teams that managed the approvals necessary to reopen our facilities, the supply chain and logistics teams that kept parts moving and the manufacturing associates who spent several weeks away from their families, thank you. Thank you for supporting the reopening effort, and most importantly, thank you for supporting our customers. This is such a great example of one of our core values. The best team wins in action. 
As we move through the rest of the year, we're keeping an eye out for further outbreaks and regional lockdowns, but we're currently seeing more normalized business operations in China and expect this positive trend to continue for the balance of the year. 
Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 60.9%, and our operating margin of 28.4% was up 60 basis points, including 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion. Our strong margin performance was a result of disciplined cost management and the proactive measures our teams have taken to address the inflationary pressures we've seen over the last several quarters. We're also using DBS tools to execute price actions, and we achieved approximately 400 basis points of price increases in the quarter, a significant acceleration from our historical price realization. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 12% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.4 billion year-to-date. 
Now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 6% and core revenue was up 7%. Strength was broad-based across the segment with high single-digit or better base business core revenue growth at each of our largest operating companies. 
In our Bioprocessing business, we continue to see record activity levels from early-stage research to later-stage development and production which drove a combined core revenue growth rate of high single digits at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our backlog and our order levels remain very healthy, and as always  we're working closely with customers to ensure they have the right inventory levels to support their planned activity. 
We are seeing our customers continue the healthy transition away from COVID-19 vaccines and therapies and into previously paused and new programs for other modalities. As a result, we now expect COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2022 down from approximately $2 billion in 2021. Now that said, there's no change to our high single to low double-digit core revenue growth outlook in our bioprocessing business for the year as customers are accelerating their investments across all other major therapeutic modalities. This acceleration, paired with improving price realization, is driving more than 20% core revenue growth in our non-COVID business, up from the low double-digit growth we've seen historically. 
The biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments in development and production. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is up more than 50% from just 5 years ago. This is being driven by both novel molecules in development and the proliferation of biosimilars, which are helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets as patents on higher-volume therapies expire. There are also over 2,000 cell and gene therapy candidates in development today, a more than tenfold increase over the last several years. And given this backdrop of such a significant and sustained increase in activity, we expect the growth rate in this market to remain very strong for many years to come. 
Now as the complexity required to manufacture these life-saving treatment increases, customers are looking to collaborate with us to help them solve their most challenging problems and assist them as they move from lab to production scale. Cytiva recently announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop the industry's first modular end-to-end manufacturing platform for allogeneic cell therapies which will help to improve the treatment of a broad array of diseases including cancer. This collaboration is just another great example of how our scientific expertise and leading positions in upstream and downstream applications are helping these cutting-edge therapies advance from the laboratory to the clinic. 
Our more instrument-oriented life science businesses collectively delivered high single-digit base business core revenue growth. We're seeing a healthy funding environment and solid demand across most major end markets. SCIEX core revenue was up more than 10% in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration of new projects at our biopharma, CRO and academic research customers. We continued our cadence of innovation with the introduction of several new solutions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of genomics and proteomics research. Notably, SCIEX introduced the Zenoswath DIA, an innovative software solution, which doubles the number of proteins that can be discovered versus previous swath approaches, helping researchers discover more potential biomarkers and better understand the cause and treatment of diseases. 
On our genomics businesses, customers are making significant investments in the development and production of cell and gene therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing. IDT had its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by robust activity and next-gen sequencing and gene writing and editing. Aldevron to more than 20% while also making significant progress on the capacity expansion projects needed to support their long-term growth outlook. 
Now moving to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 12.5% led by nearly 30% growth at Cepheid. Our other diagnostics businesses, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth despite headwinds from the COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. 
In China, our Diagnostics core revenue was flat year-over-year. Site access and patient volumes fully improved as the quarter progressed with a more pronounced recovery in June. Patient volumes remained slightly below normal levels, but we expect continued recovery as we progress through the remainder of the year. 
Now outside of China, patient volumes across hospital and reference labs held up well during the quarter and remained at or above pre-pandemic levels despite recent outbreaks of emerging COVID variants. 
Our diagnostics customers continue to face skilled labor shortages and are increasingly seeking to improve automation and productivity within their labs. This quarter, Leica Biosystems introduced its next-generation, fully automated advanced staining platform, Bond Prime, to help address these needs in the pathology lab. Bond Prime facilitates a continuous pathology lab workflow and delivers the high resolution stains needed for a definitive diagnosis with an industry-leading average turnaround time of only 90 minutes. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, core revenue growth at Cepheid was up nearly 30% in the quarter. Low teens growth across our nonrespiratory test menu was led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and urology. In respiratory testing, strong global demand persisted for Cepheid's point-of-care assay, and we believe we continue to gain market share. Respiratory testing revenue of approximately $750 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations of approximately $400 million. The spread of highly transmissible COVID variants and greater incidence of other respiratory infections, such as RSV and flu led to both higher testing volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. As a result, our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented about 50% of the 16 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for the remaining 50%. 
Now as COVID-19 shifts to an endemic disease state, we're seeing more customers begin to consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platform onto the Cepheid Gene expert. This preference for the gene expert both within hospitals and across health care networks is evidence of the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and an easy-to-use best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. In addition, as our customers begin freeing capacity from respiratory testing -- they are increasingly interested in discussing opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading point-of-care molecular testing menu. 
Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 10% with double-digit core growth at water quality and mid-single-digit core revenue growth at Product Identification. In water quality, ChemTreat, Trojan and how each grew double digits during the second quarter. Robust growth in our analytical chemistries and consumables was broad-based across all major end markets. Equipment sales remained strong with healthy levels of project activity at both industrial and municipal customers. 
At product identification, marking and coding was up high single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up high single digits, led by North America, where food and beverage sales were particularly strong. 
Our EAS team are leading the charge and writing the newest chapter in the DBS playbook to counter the supply chain and inflationary pressures we're seeing every day. They have been reengineering products to reduce our reliance on hard to source electronic components and using daily management to work closely with suppliers to ensure production parts availability. These efforts, along with our accelerated price actions, are also helping improve our margin position. We saw the impact on our results this quarter with more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion at EAS. Our strong performance also highlights the resiliency and the durability of the high-margin recurring revenue business models that make up our EAS portfolio. 
With that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a mid-single-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in low single-digit core revenue growth overall. 
For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and mid-single-digit core revenue growth overall. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect operating fall-through at the high end of our previously communicated range of 20% to 25% for the full year. 
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our results are a testament to the team's consistent execution in a dynamic operating environment and to the durable balanced position of our portfolio today. 
Looking ahead, our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System, our differentiated portfolio of businesses serving attractive end markets and our strong balance sheet all position Danaher to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John."

Now as we talk about COVID testing, I think you, as many and all of us continue to do our best in terms of forecasting what might be happening in testing at any given moment. But as we go forward with testing I think our perspective that Q3, in particular, is sort of the slowest respiratory testing quarter of the year. It's important to note, and then, of course, as you go into Q4, respiratory season picks up again and so we would expect to see that as well. And as I talked about there in my prepared remarks, we took up at COVID testing number to about $2.5 billion here from around $2.2 billion. 
We would also say it's important to think about China here. China recovered very well for us here in the second quarter after an unexpectedly long shutdown. And we continue even today to see the sort of more limited spot shutdowns throughout the country. So we continue to watch that, but fundamentally expect the second half in China to be more constructive than it was here in the second quarter."

Let me reiterate kind of what we said for the full year, and I can give you a little bit of color on Q3, hopefully, that sort of gets you where you need to be because I think. So let me recap what we said in the prepared remarks. Like Rainer just said, we reaffirmed high single-digit core growth in the base business and overall kind of mid-single-digit core growth, inclusive of tests. Like we talked about a little bit earlier, Q2 outperformance gave us the ability to fully offset all of the second half FX headwinds. So you'll see that in sort of the margins. $400 million of incremental FX here since April. Talking about 1.3 billion, almost 5% for the full year from a revenue perspective. So no doubt that the second half will have -- that FX will have an impact worse than it even did in the first half. But despite that additional FX headwind, we expect to be at the high end of the range that we talked about earlier of 20% to 25% from a perspective. So we just kind of give you that color of where we think we'll be here in the second half, inclusive of FX headwinds. And then for Q3, revenue is going to be down $200 million year-over-year, and that is all due to FX headwinds. So if you think about it, we're going to have, call it, $400 million of FX headwinds, a couple of hundred million dollars of core growth in acquisitions. But net-net, we're going to be negative here in the year. And from a -- I realize from a modeling perspective, its sort of fall through in a negative environment isn't all that meaningful. So I think maybe the easier way to think about where we're thinking about for Q3 is we're expecting our EBITDA margins to be about 30% in the quarter. And so hopefully, with that and then the full year frame, right, on 20% to 25% you can kind of -- it frames a little bit of what we're thinking about for sort of the back half from a margin perspective. Hopefully, that's helpful."

Absolutely we have contracts out there that have notification periods. Those notification periods and the way we manage contracts with nearly 100% visibility to when we can proactively move those prices is a big part of our pricing standard work. And in all businesses, including diagnostics, we have been able to move pricing in the right direction. We talked about the 400 basis points here in Q3, and as we think about sort of the second half, the first half between first quarter, second quarter was about 300 basis points, let's call it, and that's a good placeholder here, I think, for the second half as well. 
Now as you come to some businesses where contract terms are longer, let's say, as a result of freight and other types of inflationary pressures, we are able to talk about other types of fees and up charges that are not directly related to price. And that ends up providing us with the requisite uplift as well."

Obviously, the company is dramatically different. No forward of no dental and you've got all these great structural growth businesses that you've kind of taken on and are growing, particularly across all the biopharma areas. In the last downturn, you were down 12% in '09, but again, such a different business. So maybe while we don't know what the magnitude and duration of the moving pieces or what the slowdown and the recession, if we enter one will entail, clearly, you're preparing for a bunch of different scenarios. So I'm hoping you can just maybe help us think about a framework for Danaher. The Street right now has you growing, call it, like 7% or so on the base for next year. Can you give us a sense of how we should consider the different businesses faring as the economy slows here across LSD and AS? And is mid-single digit a reasonable downside case to think about or low single? Just anything you can help us frame.

First of all, I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009. And some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shut down, we only had 1 negative quarter and ended up be",771,"Sure, Dan. First of all, I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009. And some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shut down, we only had 1 negative quarter and ended up being obviously very positive for the year, even in 2020. But let's talk about the why here first. I mean, the portfolio transformation that was purpose-driven has made Danaher far more resilient today than ever before. And let's tease out why that is. I mean, first of all, over 40% of our portfolio, well over 40% is in biopharma, genomics, molecular diagnostics. And all of these are supported by very, very strong secular growth drivers. And you heard me talk about those in the prepared remarks with a number of therapeutic projects that are in the pipeline that drives so much value creation and activity in our industry. We also see population increases access to medical care increasing. So when we think about patient volumes around the world, we see those continuing to increase. Also, from a diagnostic perspective, we're very well positioned. You think about EAS, the positioning there is water is becoming scarcer, unfortunately more polluted and requires more testing. The food supply is under pressure. And so PID is very much involved in these kind of macro drivers as well. So we feel that from a portfolio perspective, it's newly purpose built for the world that we're in and the pressures that we live under. 
Now you add to that 70% of our revenues -- or I should say, over 75% of our revenues are recurring. And most of those are captive, meaning they're spec-ed in or they're specific to our equipment and instruments, along with these super durable business models, razor blade and high service levels. So that's a very different kind of business that, once again, I'd say it's purpose-built for these type of things. 
Now you add to that our scale and our DBS-led execution where even in tough and choppy times, we're able to focus on what matters, which is our customers and execute in that environment. On top of the strength of our balance sheet, we actually see these challenging macro environments as opportunities. So rather than battening down hatches here and having our head down, we're focused on executing, continuously improving and taking advantage of the opportunities that the crisis can offer us. 
And so as you think about our balance sheet position today, less than 2x net debt to EBITDA, we're well positioned there for sure. And so looking ahead, should a recession be there or should the times get choppier, we're looking to get to the other side of that even stronger than we would enter that. Now as we think about our 2023 guide, which I think is what a part of your question was trying to tease out, we feel good about our mid-single-digit plus positioning there where for the long term, which we have talked about in a number of occasions. And when you unpack that a little bit, we see bioprocessing to be up high single digits and that's consistent with what we've spoken of. And as you look at bioprocessing, there, we continue to think that the non-COVID business is going to be growing very strong. You saw what we're doing here in the second half of the year with growth rates well over 20% in non-COVID. And then we've also derisked the discussion here relating COVID related therapeutics and vaccines. We see $1 billion of revenue in 2022. That's down from $2 billion in '21. And we probably say $500 million for 2023. So 2021, $2 billion; 2022, $1 billion; and 2023, $500 million for COVID-related vaccines. And having said all that, we still see our biotechnology business growing at high single digits. 
And that leaves you then with COVID testing, and we've talked about that at length. We speak to our customers about that. They still think that COVID goes endemic at the end of '23, beginning of '24. And we still think our framework of about $1.2 billion of COVID testing revenue in '23, which is roughly around 30 million tests, is the right way to think about it. So when you put all that together, we feel very good about the way we're positioned here from a core growth perspective. I think mid-single-digit plus on the base business, and then from a COVID headwind perspective, think low single, mid-single headwind overall giving you a solid low single-digit 2023."

At the same time, our supply chain associates were prepared and ahead of the game, understanding what it would take to make a quarter, the raw materials that needed to be available, the shift size that needed to be available and the number of shipment hours that they had in order to work through it. And then we have to say, our manufacturing associates literally lived in the plant, literally lived in the plants.

So like Rainer said, too, just to give you some context, I mean, Q3 has historically been the slowest respiratory quarter of the year. And as we sort of talk to our customers, I think that's their expectation as well that as we get into the summer here, it does typically become sort of the slowest time as it picks back up in the winter. As we get into Q4, I would say that, that mix assumption will be more like the 50/50 that we saw here and that we saw last winter as well.

Now getting specifically to your point, we really haven't seen much of an impact of the biotech funding crunch here affecting the customer activity levels that we have. And frankly, we do look at these biotechs and the proposals that they are pursuing whether there's proof of concept and data. And our sense is that the good projects and where the data is solid and convincing and proof of concept is given, they are continuing to attract funding. So we think that today's cash positions in the biotechs, the quality of the projects that they are pursuing, as well as the funding environment still providing funding to those that are able to provide data continues to be quite positive and is not impacting our business. 
Now of course, to your longer-term question, we just have to see that the biotech area is a cauldron of innovation. That's where the risks are taken. That's where the out-of-the-box thinking oftentimes occurs. And that's where the Genentechs and the Amgens and others started and many more that are huge public companies today.

It's still a bit away, but we'll see what the dollar does.

So as I think about my '23 margin profile, like I said before, it's difficult right now given how dynamic things are, especially with the FX and inflation and supply chains. But I think where we are from an execution perspective here in the quarter, where we think we'll be, if we don't have any -- we might have some FX headwinds, but let's see where that ends up. But if we don't have any extra new headwinds that show up, I just think the normal VCM of 35% to 40% is the place to be. I mean the COVID testing, like you've seen, I mean, it's more or less at the fleet average. We've talked about how we sort of intentionally did that. We price it exactly the same as we price flu. So it's not as if it has a huge outsized necessary impact. So I still think it's the right place to be from a margin perspective is that fall through of 35% to 40% on low single digits. But I think given that we're going to grow that base business mid-single digit plus and with that sort of fall through, I still think you'd see even in that low single-digit environment, I still think we drive EPS growth."

265621,1787602462,2602663,"Danaher Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2022",2022-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let me start with we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-base",2162,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let me start with we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. And we were particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits and believe we gained market share in many of our businesses.
Now these results are a testament to our team's strong commitment to executing in a challenging operating environment. They've done an incredible job leveraging the Danaher Business System to help mitigate supply chain constraints, manage inflationary pressures and improve our competitive positioning with impactful new innovation.
Our second quarter results also highlights the strength and resilience of the businesses that make up Danaher today. Our portfolio is comprised of leading franchises positioned in attractive end markets with strong secular growth drivers, all united by a common set of durable business models. In fact, nearly 75% of our revenues today are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into highly regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. On top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward.
We believe this powerful combination of our talented team and the strength of our portfolio all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.
So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in a little more detail. Sales were $7.8 billion, and we delivered 9.5% core revenue growth, including 8% growth in our base business with strong contributions from all 4 of our operating platforms. COVID-19 testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter.
Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low double digits with broad-based strength across North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up mid-single digits, including impressive high single-digit growth in China.
Our results in China significantly exceeded our expectations, which is particularly notable as lockdowns continued for longer than we anticipated. So now I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our associates in China for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during such a challenging time. To the teams that managed the approvals necessary to reopen our facilities, the supply chain and logistics teams that kept parts moving and the manufacturing associates who spent several weeks away from their families, thank you. Thank you for supporting the reopening effort, and most importantly, thank you for supporting our customers. This is such a great example of one of our core values. The best team wins in action.
As we move through the rest of the year, we're keeping an eye out for further outbreaks and regional lockdowns, but we're currently seeing more normalized business operations in China and expect this positive trend to continue for the balance of the year.
Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 60.9%, and our operating margin of 28.4% was up 60 basis points, including 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion. Our strong margin performance was a result of disciplined cost management and the proactive measures our teams have taken to address the inflationary pressures we've seen over the last several quarters. We're also using DBS tools to execute price actions, and we achieved approximately 400 basis points of price increases in the quarter, a significant acceleration from our historical price realization.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 12% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.4 billion year-to-date. 
Now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 6% and core revenue was up 7%. Strength was broad-based across the segment with high single-digit or better base business core revenue growth at each of our largest operating companies.
In our Bioprocessing business, we continue to see record activity levels from early-stage research to later-stage development and production which drove a combined core revenue growth rate of high single digits at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our backlog and our order levels remain very healthy, and as always  we're working closely with customers to ensure they have the right inventory levels to support their planned activity.
We are seeing our customers continue the healthy transition away from COVID-19 vaccines and therapies and into previously paused and new programs for other modalities. As a result, we now expect COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2022 down from approximately $2 billion in 2021. Now that said, there's no change to our high single to low double-digit core revenue growth outlook in our bioprocessing business for the year as customers are accelerating their investments across all other major therapeutic modalities. This acceleration, paired with improving price realization, is driving more than 20% core revenue growth in our non-COVID business, up from the low double-digit growth we've seen historically.
The biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments in development and production. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is up more than 50% from just 5 years ago. This is being driven by both novel molecules in development and the proliferation of biosimilars, which are helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets as patents on higher-volume therapies expire. 
There are also over 2,000 cell and gene therapy candidates in development today, a more than tenfold increase over the last several years. And given this backdrop of such a significant and sustained increase in activity, we expect the growth rate in this market to remain very strong for many years to come.
Now as the complexity required to manufacture these life-saving treatment increases, customers are looking to collaborate with us to help them solve their most challenging problems and assist them as they move from lab to production scale. Cytiva recently announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop the industry's first modular end-to-end manufacturing platform for allogeneic cell therapies which will help to improve the treatment of a broad array of diseases including cancer. This collaboration is just another great example of how our scientific expertise and leading positions in upstream and downstream applications are helping these cutting-edge therapies advance from the laboratory to the clinic.
Our more instrument-oriented Life Science businesses collectively delivered high single-digit base business core revenue growth. We're seeing a healthy funding environment and solid demand across most major end markets. SCIEX core revenue was up more than 10% in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration of new projects at our biopharma, CRO and academic research customers. We continued our cadence of innovation with the introduction of several new solutions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of genomics and proteomics research. Notably, SCIEX introduced the Zeno SWATH DIA, an innovative software solution, which doubles the number of proteins that can be discovered versus previous swath approaches, helping researchers discover more potential biomarkers and better understand the cause and treatment of diseases.
On our Genomics businesses, customers are making significant investments in the development and production of cell and gene therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and the gene editing. IDT had its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by robust activity and next-gen sequencing and gene writing and editing. Aldevron to more than 20% while also making significant progress on the capacity expansion projects needed to support their long-term growth outlook.
Now moving to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 12.5% led by nearly 30% growth at Cepheid. Our other diagnostics businesses, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth despite headwinds from the COVID-19-related shutdowns in China.
In China, our Diagnostics core revenue was flat year-over-year. Site access and patient volumes slowly improved as the quarter progressed with a more pronounced recovery in June. Patient volumes remained slightly below normal levels, but we expect continued recovery as we progress through the remainder of the year.
Now outside of China, patient volumes across hospital and reference labs held up well during the quarter and remained at or above pre-pandemic levels despite recent outbreaks of emerging COVID variants.
Our diagnostics customers continue to face skilled labor shortages and are increasingly seeking to improve automation and productivity within their labs. This quarter, Leica Biosystems introduced its next-generation, fully automated advanced staining platform,  BOND-PRIME, to help address these needs in the pathology lab.  BOND-PRIME facilitates a continuous pathology lab workflow and delivers the high-resolution stains needed for a definitive diagnosis with an industry-leading average turnaround time of only 90 minutes.
Now as I mentioned earlier, core revenue growth at Cepheid was up nearly 30% in the quarter. Low teens growth across our nonrespiratory test menu was led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and [ virology ]. In respiratory testing, strong global demand persisted for Cepheid's point-of-care assay, and we believe we continue to gain market share. Respiratory testing revenue of approximately $750 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations of approximately $400 million. The spread of highly transmissible COVID variants and greater incidence of other respiratory infections, such as RSV and flu led to both higher testing volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. As a result, our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented about 50% of the 16 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for the remaining 50%.
Now as COVID-19 shifts to an endemic disease state, we're seeing more customers begin to consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platform onto the Cepheid GeneXpert. This preference for the GeneXpert both within hospitals and across health care networks is evidence of the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab-quality results and an easy-to-use best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. In addition, as our customers begin freeing capacity from respiratory testing,  they are increasingly interested in discussing opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading point-of-care molecular testing menu.
Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 10% with double-digit core growth at Water Quality and mid-single-digit core revenue growth at Product Identification. In Water Quality, ChemTreat, Trojan and how each grew double digits during the second quarter. Robust growth in our analytical chemistries and consumables was broad-based across all major end markets. Equipment sales remained strong with healthy levels of project activity at both industrial and municipal customers.
At product identification, marking and coding was up high single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up high single digits, led by North America, where food and beverage sales were particularly strong.
Our EAS team is leading the charge and writing the newest chapter in the DBS playbook to counter the supply chain and inflationary pressures we're seeing every day. They have been reengineering products to reduce our reliance on hard to source electronic components and using daily management to work closely with suppliers to ensure production parts availability. These efforts, along with our accelerated price actions, are also helping improve our margin position. We saw the impact on our results this quarter with more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion at EAS. Our strong performance also highlights the resiliency and the durability of the high-margin recurring revenue business models that make up our EAS portfolio.
With that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a mid-single-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in low single-digit core revenue growth overall.
For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and mid-single-digit core revenue growth overall. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect operating fall-through at the high end of our previously communicated range of 20% to 25% for the full year.
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our results are a testament to the team's consistent execution in a dynamic operating environment and to the durable balanced position of our portfolio today.
Looking ahead, our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System, our differentiated portfolio of businesses serving attractive end markets and our strong balance sheet all position Danaher to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John."

Now as we talk about COVID testing, I think you, as many and all of us continue to do our best in terms of forecasting what might be happening in testing at any given moment. But as we go forward with testing I think our perspective that Q3, in particular, is sort of the slowest respiratory testing quarter of the year. It's important to note, and then, of course, as you go into Q4, respiratory season picks up again and so we would expect to see that as well. 
And as I talked about there in my prepared remarks, we took up at COVID testing number to about $2.5 billion here from around $2.2 billion. We would also say it's important to think about China here. China recovered very well for us here in the second quarter after an unexpectedly long shutdown. And we continue even today to see the sort of more limited spot shutdowns throughout the country. So we continue to watch that, but fundamentally expect the second half in China to be more constructive than it was here in the second quarter."

So I mean, maybe just -- let me just be clear. Let me reiterate kind of what we said for the full year, and I can give you a little bit of color on Q3, hopefully, that sort of gets you where you need to be because I think -- so let me recap what we said in the prepared remarks. Like Rainer just said, we reaffirmed high single-digit core growth in the base business and overall kind of mid-single-digit core growth, inclusive of tests. Like we talked about a little bit earlier, Q2 outperformance gave us the ability to fully offset all of the second half FX headwinds. So you'll see that in sort of the margins. $400 million of incremental FX here since April. 
Talking about $1.3 billion, almost 5% for the full year from a revenue perspective. So no doubt that the second half will have -- that FX will have an impact worse than it even did in the first half. But despite that additional FX headwind, we expect to be at the high end of the range that we talked about earlier of 20% to 25% from a fall-through perspective. So we just kind of give you that color of where we think we'll be here in the second half, inclusive of FX headwinds. 
And then for Q3, revenue is going to be down $200 million year-over-year, and that is all due to FX headwinds. So if you think about it, we're going to have, call it, $400 million of FX headwinds, a couple of hundred million dollars of core growth in acquisitions. But net-net, we're going to be negative here in the year. And from a -- I realize from a modeling perspective, sort of fall-through in a negative environment isn't all that meaningful. So I think maybe the easier way to think about where we're thinking about for Q3 is we're expecting our EBITDA margins to be about 30% in the quarter. And so hopefully, with that and then the full year frame, right, on 20% to 25% you can kind of -- it frames a little bit of what we're thinking about for sort of the back half from a margin perspective. Hopefully, that's helpful."

Absolutely, we have contracts out there that have notification periods. Those notification periods and the way we manage contracts with nearly 100% visibility to when we can proactively move those prices is a big part of our pricing standard work. And in all businesses, including diagnostics, we have been able to move pricing in the right direction. We talked about the 400 basis points here in Q3, and as we think about sort of the second half, the first half between first quarter, second quarter was about 300 basis points, let's call it, and that's a good placeholder here, I think, for the second half as well. 
Now as you come to some businesses where contract terms are longer, let's say, as a result of freights and other types of inflationary pressures, we are able to talk about other types of fees and up charges that are not directly related to price. And that ends up providing us with the requisite uplift as well."

Obviously, the company is dramatically different. No Fortive, no dental and you've got all these great structural growth businesses that you've kind of taken on and are growing, particularly across all the biopharma areas. In the last downturn, you were down 12% in '09, but again, such a different business. So maybe while we don't know what the magnitude and duration of the moving pieces or what the slowdown and the recession, if we enter one will entail, clearly, you're preparing for a bunch of different scenarios. 
So I'm hoping you can just maybe help us think about a framework for Danaher. The Street right now has you growing, call it, like 7% or so on the base for next year. Can you give us a sense of how we should consider the different businesses faring as the economy slows here across [ LSD and EAS ]?

First of all, I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009. And some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shut down, we only had 1 negative quarter and ended up be",773,"Sure, Dan. First of all, I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009. And some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shut down, we only had 1 negative quarter and ended up being obviously very positive for the year, even in 2020. But let's talk about the why here first. I mean, the portfolio transformation that was purpose-driven has made Danaher far more resilient today than ever before. 
And let's tease out why that is. I mean, first of all, over 40% of our portfolio, well over 40% is in biopharma, genomics, molecular diagnostics. And all of these are supported by very, very strong secular growth drivers. And you heard me talk about those in the prepared remarks with a number of therapeutic projects that are in the pipeline that drives so much value creation and activity in our industry. We also see population increases, access to medical care increasing. So when we think about patient volumes around the world, we see those continuing to increase. 
Also, from a diagnostic perspective, we're very well positioned. You think about EAS, the positioning there is water is becoming scarcer, unfortunately more polluted and requires more testing. The food supply is under pressure. And so PID is very much involved in these kind of macro drivers as well. So we feel that from a portfolio perspective, it's newly purpose built for the world that we're in and the pressures that we live under. 
Now you add to that 70% of our revenues -- or I should say, over 75% of our revenues are recurring. And most of those are captive, meaning they're [ specced ] in or they're specific to our equipment and instruments, along with these super durable business models, razor blade and high service levels. So that's a very different kind of business that, once again, I'd say it's purpose-built for these type of things. 
Now you add to that our scale and our DBS-led execution where even in tough and choppy times, we're able to focus on what matters, which is our customers and execute in that environment. On top of the strength of our balance sheet, we actually see these challenging macro environments as opportunities. So rather than battening down hatches here and having our head down, we're focused on executing, continuously improving and taking advantage of the opportunities that the crisis can offer us. 
And so as you think about our balance sheet position today, less than 2x net debt to EBITDA, we're well positioned there for sure. And so looking ahead, should a recession be there or should the times get choppier, we're looking to get to the other side of that even stronger than we would enter that. 
Now as we think about our 2023 guide, which I think is what a part of your question was trying to tease out, we feel good about our mid-single-digit plus positioning there where for the long term, which we have talked about in a number of occasions. And when you unpack that a little bit, we see bioprocessing to be up high single digits and that's consistent with what we've spoken of. And as you look at bioprocessing, there, we continue to think that the non-COVID business is going to be growing very strong. You saw what we're doing here in the second half of the year with growth rates well over 20% in non-COVID. And then we've also derisked the discussion here relating COVID related therapeutics and vaccines. We see $1 billion of revenue in 2022. That's down from $2 billion in '21. And we probably say $500 million for 2023. So 2021, $2 billion; 2022, $1 billion; and 2023, $500 million for COVID-related vaccines. And having said all that, we still see our biotechnology business growing at high single digits. 
And that leaves you then with COVID testing, and we've talked about that at length. We speak to our customers about that. They still think that COVID goes endemic at the end of '23, beginning of '24. And we still think our framework of about $1.2 billion of COVID testing revenue in '23, which is roughly around 30 million tests, is the right way to think about it. So when you put all that together, we feel very good about the way we're positioned here from a core growth perspective. I think mid-single-digit plus on the base business, and then from a COVID headwind perspective, think low single, mid-single headwind overall giving you a solid low single-digit 2023."

So like Rainer said, too, just to give you some context, I mean, Q3 has historically been the slowest respiratory quarter of the year. And as we sort of talk to our customers, I think that's their expectation as well that as we get into the summer here, it does typically become sort of the slowest time as it picks back up in the winter.

And then how should we think about, let's say, that we face a prolonged constrained funding environment for the SMID biotechs.

And so then as you go upstream from that, that has less of an impact. Now getting specifically to your point, we really haven't seen much of an impact of the biotech funding crunch here affecting the customer activity levels that we have. And frankly, we do look at these biotechs and the proposals that they are pursuing whether there's proof of concept and data. 
And our sense is that the good projects and where the data is solid and convincing and proof of concept is given, they are continuing to attract funding. So we think that today's cash positions in the biotechs, the quality of the projects that they are pursuing, as well as the funding environment still providing funding to those that are able to provide data continues to be quite positive and is not impacting our business. 
Now of course, to your longer-term question, we just have to see that the biotech area is a cauldron of innovation. That's where the risks are taken. That's where the out-of-the-box thinking oftentimes occurs. And that's where the Genentechs and the Amgens and others started and many more that are huge public companies today.

It sounds like with all the moving pieces in terms of COVID headwinds, will probably shake out maybe a little more low single than the mid-single for '23. And I'm just trying to figure out, I guess, with all the mix changes again being a little less COVID, more heavy on the core, what the right way to think about the incrementals is? I mean it sounds like Matt earlier was talking about kind of getting back to that 35%, 40%. But just wanted to circle up in terms of the moving pieces again, given the mix shift, I assume FX is going to be a bit of a headwind in the first half. It's still a bit away, but we'll see what the dollar does. But can you just talk through, I guess, that margin structure as we work our way into '23, given again the growth is looking a little more low single with the COVID headwinds that you laid out?"

I mean, I think maybe just kind of like you said, get everybody around it, that low single is overall. The base business, we think, would be mid-single-digit plus and the COVID headwinds, which are all testing at this point would be sort of down low to mid-single, to get to a low single overall. So as I think about my '23 margin profile, like I said before, it's difficult right now given how dynamic things are, especially with the FX and inflation and supply chains. But I think where we are from an execution perspective here in the quarter, where we think we'll be, if we don't have any -- we might have some FX headwinds, but let's see where that ends up. 
But if we don't have any extra new headwinds that show up, I just think the normal VCM of 35% to 40% is the place to be. I mean the COVID testing, like you've seen, I mean, it's more or less at the fleet average. We've talked about how we sort of intentionally did that. We price it exactly the same as we price flu. So it's not as if it has a huge outsized necessary impact. So I still think the right place to be from a margin perspective is that fall-through of 35% to 40% on low single digits. But I think given that we're going to grow that base business mid-single digit plus and with that sort of fall-through, I still think you'd see -- even in that low single-digit environment, I still think we drive EPS growth."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in. Our positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance",1972,"Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in. 
Our positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance. This strength was based across the portfolio with high single-digit or better core growth in all 3 reporting segments. 
We're particularly pleased with the consistent performance of our base business which has grown high single digits or better for 9 consecutive quarters. Now these well-rounded results were driven by our team's outstanding execution through a challenging operating environment. They've done a terrific job running the Danaher playbook to proactively reduce structural costs while continuing to accelerate high-impact growth investments. We believe our ability to deliver meaningful innovation and reliably serve customers has contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses. 
Now during the quarter, we also announced our intention to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company. This new company, which we'll refer to as EAS for now, will be well positioned in the most attractive areas of the water quality and product identification market. EAS will be comprised of outstanding businesses with strong ESG fundamentals, durable business models and a very attractive financial profile, averaging mid-single-digit core revenue growth over the last 5 years with 55% recurring revenue today and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. 
Now as a stand-alone company, EAS will have greater opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital towards M&A. And of course, EAS will have the Danaher Business System as its foundation, along with the commitment to continuous improvement that will support the same outstanding results EAS as a part of Danaher today. Of course, we look forward to sharing more details here in the coming months. 
As for Danaher, this separation will establish us as a more focused science and technology leader committed to innovation and making a profound impact on human health. We've got a great lineup of leading franchises positioned in highly attractive life sciences and diagnostics end markets, all united by a common set of durable, high recurring revenue business models. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitive advantage in these areas, and we see tremendous opportunities to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. 
So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.7 billion, and we delivered 10% core revenue growth, including 8.5% core growth in our base business. Respiratory testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. 
Geographically, we continue to see strong demand across the developed markets despite current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. North America's core revenue was up high teens with all 3 segments delivering double-digit or better core revenue growth. Core revenue in Western Europe grew high single digits with customer activity and funding levels remaining healthy. 
High gross markets core revenues were up mid-single digits. In China, our teams effectively managed through ongoing COVID-19 headwinds to deliver high single-digit growth in the quarter. 
Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.8%, and our operating margin was 26.3%. We had 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driven in part by disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions. The operating environment remains dynamic across our businesses globally, but we experienced fewer supply chain disruptions in the third quarter. Logistics improved as freight costs began to stabilize. 
We also saw modest improvements in material availability, though certain electronic components remained difficult to procure. 
Despite these challenges, our teams have done an outstanding job taking proactive measures and leveraging the DBS tool set to minimize the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.50 were up 7% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.2 billion year-to-date. 
So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. 
In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 4% and and core revenue was up 8%. Strength was broad-based with most businesses achieving high single-digit or better core revenue growth. 
In Bioprocessing, robust activity levels drove over 20% growth in our non-COVID business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. 
As expected, our customers continue to transition away from COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic program and into programs for other modalities. We expect these trends to continue through the fourth quarter resulting in high single-digit core revenue growth in our bioprocessing business for the full year. 
In September, we hosted an Investor Day at Cytiva to showcase our Bioprocessing business and highlighted the tremendous long-term growth opportunities we're positioned for in biologics and genomic medicine. 
We also announced that we're bringing together Cytiva and Pall's Life Sciences as the biotechnology group. The combined portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities for monoclonal antibodies to emerging cell, gene and mRNA-based therapies. The biotechnology group will have unmatched global scale with the industry's largest commercial team, allowing us to further extend the reach of our best-in-class customer service. 
We also believe focused innovation across the joint portfolio will ensure our products and solutions are aligned to best meet customers' needs around quality, yield and cost. 
With Pall's Life Sciences and Cytiva joining forces, the Biotechnology Group is uniquely positioned to help our customers become more efficient and bring more life-saving therapies to market faster. 
Moving to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. They collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by SCIEX, Leica micro systems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Funding levels remains strong globally, and we saw solid customer demand across most major end markets. 
We continued our strong pace of innovation in life sciences with the introduction of Beckman Coulter's Biomet ingenious. The ingenious is a cost-effective easy-to-use sample preparation system that reduces manual transfers and hands-on time and next-gen sequencing library construction. This is a great example of how our investments in innovation are delivering impactful solutions to our customers. 
Our genomics businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by strong demand for plasmic, RNA and next-generation sequencing solutions. This quarter, marked Aldevrons first anniversary as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance. 
Financially, the results speak for themselves, with more than 30% year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition. The team has done a tremendous job embracing DBS tools and processes to meaningfully reduce lead times and increase capacity. Now this capacity is certainly supporting customers' needs today, but it's equally important to support Aldevron the long-term growth outlook. 
With a view towards the future, we're excited about the opportunities to collaborate across our genomics businesses and create unique solutions to help our customers accelerate the development and commercialization of mRNA and other nucleic acid-based therapies. 
Moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 13.5%, led by nearly 30% core revenue growth at Cepheid. 
Leica Biosystems grew mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. As customers seek to improve productivity within their labs, we're seeing strong early momentum for Leica innovation, Bond Prime, a fully automated advancing platform. 
Beckman Coulter Diagnostics delivered solid results with mid-single-digit core growth despite ongoing COVID-19 headwinds in China. 
In Molecular Diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu grew approximately 10%, led by double-digit growth in virology and infectious disease testing. In respiratory testing, global PCR volumes have moderated, but demand is still elevated for symptomatic testing at the point of care where Cepheid is the gold standard. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $875 million exceeded our expectations of approximately $325 million. Higher prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, combined with advanced purchases by customers in anticipation of a more severe respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, led to both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. 
Now we're starting to see our customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms onto Cepheid gene expert. The gene expert provides significant value to clinicians with a unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow. Customers are also increasingly interested in opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading testament. Our opportunity funnel for nonrespiratory tests has increased significantly this year and we see opportunities to continue gaining market share moving forward. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 10.5%. Water quality was up mid-teens, and product identification grew low single digits. Electronic identification, marking and coding was up low single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up low single digits, in part due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q3 last year. 
Now during the quarter, we saw strength in food and beverage as well as the consumer end markets. In Water Quality, ChemTreat and Hach each grew high teens during the third quarter. Demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remain solid across our major end markets, municipal and industrial project activity was broadly consistent with the first half of the year, driving solid equipment growth. 
Now last week at WesTech, the annual wastewater trade show, the water quality team highlighted several solutions that are improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water treatment process. POC's Ultra low-range chlorine analyzer,raises the industry standard to parts per billion chemical detection levels, helping customers extend the membrane life of their treatment systems and reduce maintenance costs. 
At Trojan, innovative solutions such as Trojan UV Cigna and Trojan UV 3000+ reduced environmental impact by treating water with ultraviolet light instead of traditional chemical disinfection method. Every day, over 1 billion people benefit from water treated by Trojan. 
So these are just a few examples of how our water quality platform is supporting customers day-to-day, mission-critical water operations and making a positive impact on the world. 
So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a high single to low double-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in a core revenue growth being flat to down low single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. 
Now for the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We now expect high single-digit overall core revenue growth, which is up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits as a result of our strong COVID-19 testing performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect operating profit fall through of approximately 25% for the full year. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Our well-rounded performance really is a testament to our team's commitment to innovating and executing in support of our customers. These results also reinforce Danaher's strength and durability. Our differentiated portfolio is well positioned in attractive end markets with long-term secular growth drivers and our business models are resilient with nearly 75% of our revenue today being recurring. 
So putting it all together, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet, combined with our talented team and the power of the proactive application of the Danaher Business System, provides an outstanding foundation for delivering sustainable long-term results. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And let me get right after that question here. So First of all, let's talk about 2022, and I'll certainly speak about the inventory topic here as well. I think Important to reiterate that overall, we're seeing very strong customer demand in",512,"Thanks, Derik. And let me get right after that question here. So First of all, let's talk about 2022, and I'll certainly speak about the inventory topic here as well. I think Important to reiterate that overall, we're seeing very strong customer demand in Bioprocessing, and we expect to finish 2022 with high single-digit core growth. Now that splits up in a number of sections. 
Let's start with the non-COVID Bioprocessing is growing well over 20%, and we continue to see that. And the underlying fundamentals here are the funding is there, the clinical trials continue to progress. The pipeline is strong. We're seeing product move into commercial production from Phase III and this has really accelerated across all modalities. So sure, monoclonal antibodies, but yes, we're even seeing cell and gene therapy starting to gain their approvals. 
Additionally, pricing is above historical levels, which is driving some incremental growth, if you will, on top of the underlying demand in the non-COVID areas. 
Now as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers do continue to move away from COVID-related projects. And I don't think that's a surprise to any of us. That's something that we have been speaking about for some time. And in fact, we can confirm that, that is happening. And I think it also reconciles with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We're seeing that vaccines, our uptake is relatively slow. People are unsure if the current vaccine inventories will address the newest variance. So there's a bit of uncertainty there, I think, in the public as to where we go from a vaccine perspective. And that reflects naturally in what we have seen here with customers starting to move to the other modalities and drive the projects that they had on hold forward. And for us, that manifests here in for the full year that we see $800 million of COVID revenues in Bioprocessing as opposed to the $1 billion that we had been talking about previously. So we do see customers moving away from these COVID projects and driving their energies, their efforts and their financial resources into the other projects, and that helps explain why we see the larger part of the business growing at well over 20%. 
Now we are not seeing significant stocking, but we do see pockets of stocking, particularly there where there were large COVID-related, either therapeutic or vaccine programs. So those players that heavily invested in large programs here those players that, in fact, have higher inventories than is normally the case. Having said that, those large players also are those which are best positioned to redeploy those inventories to other projects. So we do expect an inventory burn down with those players here in the coming quarters. So that's the inventory situation there, Derik. And then as it relates to some of the other points here, I think we continue to be -- and I just want to reaffirm the high single-digit growth. We're high single digit here year-to-date, and that's how we see ourselves in Bioprocessing concluding the year."

So for Q3, our orders are down over 20% as expected. And I think that's a number which bears some commentary and context. First of all, we're coming off of order comps that are well in excess of 50% in the prior year. And so it's impo",367,"Sure. Sure, Derik. So for Q3, our orders are down over 20% as expected. And I think that's a number which bears some commentary and context. 
First of all, we're coming off of order comps that are well in excess of 50% in the prior year. And so it's important to take in order to be able to rationalize these numbers that sometimes are viewed in isolation with the right context. The 3-year order stack is over 20%. And I think something that is perhaps not as well known and that bears some conversation is we and many others have meaningfully reduced our lead time. And we've done that through capacity investments. We've done that through productivity investments. We've been able to do that because the supply chain has become more secure. And that's a pretty significant impact on the order placement cadence of our customers. So just to mention an example here, if lead times go from 52 weeks, which has been the case in some product categories in the marketplace, to 12 weeks, customers fundamentally change their order patterns. To give you a sense of that, if a customer wanted to order over time 4 bioreactors, they would order all 4 bioreactors at 1 if there's a 52-week lead time. But if it's a 12-week lead time, they would order 1 bioreactor and then follow up with other orders in the future. 
So what we're seeing right now is really the normalization of the marketplace coming from a red-hot pandemic fuel time of constraint a long lead times for orders ramped up significantly. So order rates ramped up significantly to the supply chain now normalizing and customers adjusting their order cadence. And then yes, of course, the COVID volumes are down. That's expected. We've been talking about that, but we also see the strength of the non-COVID market. And keep in mind, that's a much larger market. And currently, it is growing at well over 20% and there's a backlog to be burned down there because previously COVID had been prioritized. 
So the orders were negative to repeat, but not unexpectedly and to be seen in the context of a market that is now readjusting."

And what was a time",361,"We have been as a result of the pandemic, even closer than traditionally working with our customers to understand their production plans and to ensure that they are not overstocking at the expense of others who would need the product. And what was a time of constraint here for the last, call it, 18, 20 months. 
So as a result of that, we feel as though we are well positioned to understand the inventory situation. We do regular surveys with our customers. And as a result of that, we don't believe that there is a general overstocking in the market. 
Having said that, we do think there are pockets where inventories are high. And those are based on customers ultimately changing their production plans, in other words, canceling orders specifically for COVID. And so the large COVID players whether that be for vaccine production or whether that be for therapeutics production, they have larger inventories and those will likely exceed 6 months of inventory. 
But I think it's important to note that those large players have many programs, and they're able to redeploy that inventory. In most cases, these are not tailor-made solutions for any specific molecule and can be redirected and burn down using -- in the use for other modalities or other programs at the same modality. 
So we do see that the market is currently resetting itself from, as I mentioned, a red-hot pandemic era of constraint with long lead times to one where lead times and supply chain disruptions are starting to normalize and then add to that the cancellation of some COVID vaccine or therapeutic plans just because the uptake hasn't been the same or the variants have rendered them not usable for that application. 
So we are confident that the strength of this market and its fundamentals, remain very, very strong. Biologics, in all the modalities that we've talked about are very underpenetrated in the market, and it is a matter of getting the penetration up launching the new products in the pipeline that we'll continue to drive the growth of this market despite the reset that we see going on in the supply chain."

So especially pharma, CROs and academic research continues to be well funded, and we're seeing strong buying behavior there, especially towards instruments that provide the necessary answers here in the research. And that's really the newest generation of instruments. And that brings me really to the second pillar of the strength that we've seen there, which is our continued innovation performance there with all of the operating companies really leaning in and launching leading edge really pushing science further instruments. And I'll give you some examples at SCIEX, the Xeno 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500.

So logistic capacities have ramped. We're starting to see greater availability. We're also starting to see freight rates come down, specifically if you think of container freight Those, in particular, have come down quite significantly. And that, of course, is helpful with the global businesses that we have. 
At the same time, we do see continued pressure on a more limited set of electronic components. So with the Danaher Business System, call it, we've been able to really knock down 80% of the issues there. And I think with that, able to continue to take share because of the availability of our solutions. And with 20%, we're still in countermeasure mode. And I would say that number continues to get smaller every day, but there's still on the electronic component side, some tightness here. 
I would just say what is still the same as labor continues to be tight. That is the case, practically everywhere we operate. And so that that's a constraint that we would expect to see get better here over the next 12 to 18 months, but currently still see that as an area to watch out for."

Our funnels continue to be strong. And I would say that we're starting to see deal velocity slow a little bit. So it is clear that people are starting to think about where they're going to invest their cash at least for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing robust demand and robust funding. 
Having said that, and in view of everything we read in the news as to you, we continue to watch that very closely to see whether that sustains going forward into '23. And of course, we're going to talk to you about that again in January. 
Now as it relates to our own exposure, specifically as it relates to energy, we continue for many reasons to take a very close look at our energy consumption, so also from a sustainability perspective. But now particularly this becomes an area of focus for Europe. 
And in fact, we do not have a lot of heavy manufacturing, so energy-intensive manufacturing in Europe. It's mostly light assembly, and we have taken the measures to ensure energy supply continuity through the appropriate backup systems. 
And then in the event of, if you will, fuel rationing, whether that's gas oil or otherwise, we also have contingency plans there to ensure that we're able to reduce our demand, but still supply mission-critical capabilities, including manufacturing, should that become the case. So yes, it's something that we're closely focused on. Two, we've taken measures in order to ensure that we have supply and can provide supply continuity. And then lastly, we also have the contingency plans should the situation deteriorate."

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in.

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in.  
Our positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance. This strength was based across the portfolio with high single-digit or better core growth in all 3 reporting segments.  
We're particularly pleased with the consistent performance of our base business, which has grown high single digits or better for 9 consecutive quarters. Now these well-rounded results were driven by our team's outstanding execution through a challenging operating environment. They've done a terrific job running the Danaher playbook to proactively reduce structural costs while continuing to accelerate high-impact growth investments. We believe our ability to deliver meaningful innovation and reliably serve customers has contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses.  
Now during the quarter,  we also announced our intention to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company. This new company, which we'll refer to as EAS for now, will be well positioned in the most attractive areas of the water quality and product identification market. EAS will be comprised of outstanding businesses with strong ESG fundamentals, durable business models and a very attractive financial profile, averaging mid-single-digit core revenue growth over the last 5 years with 55% recurring revenue today and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25%.  
Now as a stand-alone company, EAS will have greater opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital towards M&A. And of course, EAS will have the Danaher Business System as its foundation, along with the commitment to continuous improvement that will support the same outstanding results EAS as a part of Danaher today. Of course, we look forward to sharing more details here in the coming months.  
As for Danaher, this separation will establish us as a more focused science and technology leader committed to innovation and making a profound impact on human health. We've got a great lineup of leading franchises positioned in highly attractive life sciences and diagnostics end markets, all united by a common set of durable, high recurring revenue business models. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitive advantage in these areas, and we see tremendous opportunities to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance.  
So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.7 billion, and we delivered 10% core revenue growth, including 8.5% core growth in our base business. Respiratory testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter.  
Geographically, we continue to see strong demand across the developed markets despite current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. North America's core revenue was up high teens with all 3 segments delivering double-digit or better core revenue growth. Core revenue in Western Europe grew high single digits with customer activity and funding levels remaining healthy.  
High-growth markets core revenues were up mid-single digits. In China, our teams effectively managed through ongoing COVID-19 headwinds to deliver high single-digit growth in the quarter.  
Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.8%, and our operating margin was 26.3%. We had 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driven in part by disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions. The operating environment remains dynamic across our businesses globally, but we experienced fewer supply chain disruptions in the third quarter. Logistics improved as freight costs began to stabilize.  We also saw modest improvements in material availability, though certain electronic components remained difficult to procure.  
Despite these challenges, our teams have done an outstanding job taking proactive measures and leveraging the DBS tool set to minimize the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures.  
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.50 were up 7% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.2 billion year-to-date.  
So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today.  
In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 4% and core revenue was up 8%. Strength was broad-based with most businesses achieving high single-digit or better core revenue growth.  
In bioprocessing, robust activity levels drove over 20% growth in our non-COVID business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech.  
As expected,  our customers continue to transition away from COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic program and into programs for other modalities. We expect these trends to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in high single-digit core revenue growth in our bioprocessing business for the full year.  
In September, we hosted an Investor Day at Cytiva to showcase our bioprocessing business and highlighted the tremendous long-term growth opportunities we're positioned for in biologics and genomic medicine.  
We also announced that we're bringing together Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences as the biotechnology group. The combined portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities, from monoclonal antibodies to emerging cell, gene and mRNA-based therapies. The biotechnology group will have unmatched global scale with the industry's largest commercial team, allowing us to further extend the reach of our best-in-class customer service.  
We also believe focused innovation across the joint portfolio will ensure our products and solutions are aligned to best meet customers' needs around quality, yield and cost.  With Pall Life Sciences and Cytiva joining forces, the biotechnology group is uniquely positioned to help our customers become more efficient and bring more life-saving therapies to market faster.  
Moving to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. They collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by SCIEX, Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Funding levels remain strong globally, and we saw solid customer demand across most major end markets.  
We continued our strong pace of innovation in life sciences with the introduction of Beckman Coulter's Biomek NGeniuS. NGeniuS is a cost-effective, easy-to-use sample preparation system that reduces manual transfers and hands-on time and next-gen sequencing library construction. This is a great example of how our investments in innovation are delivering impactful solutions to our customers.  
Our genomics businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by strong demand for plasmid, RNA and next-generation sequencing solutions. This quarter marked Aldevron's first anniversary as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance.  
Financially, the results speak for themselves, with more than 30% year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition. The team has done a tremendous job embracing DBS tools and processes to meaningfully reduce lead times and increase capacity. Now this capacity is certainly supporting customers' needs today, but it's equally important to support Aldevron's long-term growth outlook.  
With a view towards the future, we're excited about the opportunities to collaborate across our genomics businesses and create unique solutions to help our customers accelerate the development and commercialization of mRNA and other nucleic acid-based therapies.  
Moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 13.5%, led by nearly 30% core revenue growth at Cepheid.  
Leica Biosystems grew mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. As customers seek to improve productivity within their labs, we're seeing strong early momentum for Leica's recent innovation, BOND-PRIME, a fully automated advanced staining platform.  Beckman Coulter Diagnostics delivered solid results with mid-single-digit core growth despite ongoing COVID-19 headwinds in China.  
In molecular diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu grew approximately 10%, led by double-digit growth in virology and infectious disease testing. In respiratory testing, global PCR volumes have moderated, but demand is still elevated for symptomatic testing at the point of care where Cepheid is the gold standard. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $875 million exceeded our expectations of approximately $325 million. Higher prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, combined with advanced purchases by customers in anticipation of a more severe respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, led to both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV.  
Now we're starting to see our customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms onto Cepheid's GeneXpert. The GeneXpert provides significant value to clinicians with a unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow. Customers are also increasingly interested in opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading test menu. Our opportunity funnel for nonrespiratory tests has increased significantly this year and we see opportunities to continue gaining market share moving forward.  
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 10.5%. Water quality was up mid-teens, and product identification grew low single digits. At product identification, marking and coding was up low single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up low single digits, in part due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q3 last year.  
Now during the quarter, we saw strength in food and beverage as well as the consumer end markets. In Water Quality, ChemTreat and Hach each grew high teens during the third quarter. Demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remain solid across our major end markets. Municipal and industrial project activity was broadly consistent with the first half of the year, driving solid equipment growth.  
Now last week at WEFTEC, the annual wastewater trade show, the Water Quality team highlighted several solutions that are improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water treatment process. Hach's Ultra Low Range Chlorine Analyzer raises the industry standard to parts per billion chemical detection levels, helping customers extend the membrane life of their treatment systems and reduce maintenance costs.  
At Trojan, innovative solutions such as TrojanUVSigna and TrojanUV3000Plus reduce environmental impact by treating water with ultraviolet light instead of traditional chemical disinfection method. Every day, over 1 billion people benefit from water treated by Trojan.  
So these are just a few examples of how our Water Quality platform is supporting customers day-to-day, mission-critical water operations and making a positive impact on the world.  
So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.  
In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a high single to low double-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in a core revenue growth being flat to down low single digits in the fourth quarter.  Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%.  
Now for the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We now expect high single-digit overall core revenue growth, which is up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits as a result of our strong COVID-19 testing performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect operating profit fall-through of approximately 25% for the full year.  
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Our well-rounded performance really is a testament to our team's commitment to innovating and executing in support of our customers. These results also reinforce Danaher's strength and durability. Our differentiated portfolio is well positioned in attractive end markets with long-term secular growth drivers, and our business models are resilient with nearly 75% of our revenue today being recurring.  
So putting it all together, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet, combined with our talented team and the power of the proactive application of the Danaher Business System, provides an outstanding foundation for delivering sustainable long-term results.  
So with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

Also, we've gotten question, you're talking about high single-digit growth for the full year. I think you commented high single to double-digit prior quarter. So can you sort of walk us through the dynamics? Are you still looking for like $1 billion in COVID vaccine for this year?

So first of all, let's talk about 2022, and I'll certainly speak about the inventory topic here as well. I think it's important to reiterate that overall, we're seeing very strong customer demand in bioprocessing, and we expect to finish 2022 with high single-digit core growth. Now that splits up in a number of sections.  
Let's start with the non-COVID bioprocessing is growing well over 20%, and we continue to see that. And the underlying fundamentals here are the funding is there, the clinical trials continue to progress, the pipeline is strong. We're seeing product move into commercial production from Phase III, and this has really accelerated across all modalities. So sure, monoclonal antibodies, but yes, we're even seeing cell and gene therapy starting to gain their approvals.  Additionally, pricing is above historical levels, which is driving some incremental growth, if you will, on top of the underlying demand in the non-COVID areas.  
Now as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers do continue to move away from COVID-related projects. And I don't think that's a surprise to any of us. That's something that we have been speaking about for some time. And in fact, we can confirm that, that is happening. And I think it also reconciles with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We're seeing that vaccines, our uptake is relatively slow. People are unsure if the current vaccine inventories will address the newest variance. So there's a bit of uncertainty there, I think, in the public as to where we go from a vaccine perspective. And that reflects naturally in what we have seen here with customers starting to move to the other modalities and drive the projects that they had on hold forward. And for us, that manifests here in -- for the full year that we see $800 million of COVID revenues in bioprocessing as opposed to the $1 billion that we had been talking about previously. So we do see customers moving away from these COVID projects and driving their energies, their efforts and their financial resources into the other projects, and that helps explain why we see the larger part of the business growing at well over 20%.  
Now we are not seeing significant stocking, but we do see pockets of stocking, particularly there where there were large COVID-related, either therapeutic or vaccine programs. So those players that heavily invested in large programs here are those players that, in fact, have higher inventories than is normally the case. Having said that, those large players also are those which are best positioned to redeploy those inventories to other projects. So we do expect an inventory burn-down with those players here in the coming quarters. So that's the inventory situation there, Derik. And then as it relates to some of the other points here, I think we continue to be -- and I just want to reaffirm the high single-digit growth. We're high single digit here year-to-date, and that's how we see ourselves in bioprocessing concluding the year."

And I think that's a number which bears some commentary and context.  
First of all, we're coming off of order comps that are well in excess of 50% in the prior year. And so it's important to take in order to be able to rationalize these numbers that sometimes are viewed in isolation with the right context. The 3-year order stack is over 20%. And I think something that is perhaps not as well known and that bears some conversation is we and many others have meaningfully reduced our lead time. And we've done that through capacity investments, we've done that through productivity investments. We've been able to do that because the supply chain has become more secure. And that's a pretty significant impact on the order placement cadence of our customers. 
So just to mention an example here, if lead times go from 52 weeks, which has been the case in some product categories in the marketplace, to 12 weeks, customers fundamentally change their order patterns. To give you a sense of that, if a customer wanted to order over time 4 bioreactors, they would order all 4 bioreactors at once if there's a 52-week lead time. But if it's a 12-week lead time, they would order 1 bioreactor and then follow up with other orders in the future.  
So what we're seeing right now is really the normalization of the marketplace coming from a red-hot pandemic fueled time of constraint, a long lead time for orders ramped up significantly. So order rates ramped up significantly to the supply chain now normalizing and customers adjusting their order cadence. And then yes, of course, the COVID volumes are down. That's expected. We've been talking about that, but we also see the strength of the non-COVID market. And keep in mind, that's a much larger market. And currently, it is growing at well over 20%. There's a backlog to be burned down there because previously, COVID had been prioritized.  
So the orders were negative to repeat, but not unexpectedly and to be seen in the context of a market that is now readjusting."

So as a result of that, we feel as though we are well positioned to understand the inventory situation. We do regular surveys with our customers. And as a result of that, we don't believe that there is a general overstocking in the market. 
Having said that, we do think there are pockets where inventories are high. And those are based on customers ultimately changing their production plans, in other words, canceling orders specifically for COVID. And so the large COVID players, whether that be for vaccine production or whether that be for therapeutics production, they have larger inventories, and those will likely exceed 6 months of inventory. 
But I think it's important to note that those large players have many programs, and they're able to redeploy that inventory. So there's a -- in most cases, these are not tailor-made solutions for any specific molecule and can be redirected and burn down using -- it can be used for other modalities or other programs at the same modality. 
So we do see that the market is currently resetting itself from, as I mentioned, a red-hot pandemic era of constraint with long lead times to one where lead times and supply chain disruptions are starting to normalize and then add to that the cancellation of some COVID vaccine or therapeutic plans just because the uptake hasn't been the same or the variants have rendered them not usable for that application. 
So we are confident that the strength of this market and its fundamentals remain very, very strong. Biologics, in all the modalities that we've talked about, are very underpenetrated in the market. And it is a matter of getting the penetration up, launching the new products in the pipeline that will continue to drive the growth of this market despite the reset that we see going on in the supply chain."

And as you pointed out, this is really led by Leica Microsystems, SCIEX, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences with some very, very strong results. And I think the strength of that comes from 2 areas. The first is the end markets continue to be very strong. So especially pharma, CROs and academic research continues to be well funded, and we're seeing strong buying behavior there, especially towards instruments that provide the necessary answers here in the research. And that's really the newest generation of instruments. 
And that brings me really to the second pillar of the strength that we've seen there, which is our continued innovation performance there with all of the operating companies really leaning in and launching leading edge, really pushing science further, instruments. And I'll give you some examples. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500. At LMS, you have the THUNDER widefield imaging system. And we talked about the Mica launch, which is doing extraordinarily well. And then we just talked about the NGeniuS launch here at Beckman Life Sciences. 
So we're really seeing strength from a funding perspective, and we believe that on top of that, we're outperforming because of the innovation strength that we've shown here, launching a number of great solutions. 
Now from a comp perspective, we really do think that the strength in the market is sustained. We expect that to be the case in the fourth quarter. And in 2023, like I said, we'll talk about that more in January, but we don't have reason to believe here that this will be significantly different."

So I think the first place where you're starting to see some of the pressure dissipate is in the logistics area. So logistics capacities have ramped. We're starting to see greater availability.

So logistics capacities have ramped. We're starting to see greater availability. We're also starting to see freight rates come down, specifically if you think of container freight Those, in particular, have come down quite significantly. And that, of course, is helpful with the global businesses that we have. 
At the same time, we do see continued pressure on a more limited set of electronic components. So with the Danaher Business System, call it, we've been able to really knock down 80% of the issues there and I think with that, able to continue to take share because of the availability of our solutions. And with 20%, we're still in countermeasure mode. And I would say that number continues to get smaller every day, but there's still on the electronic component side, some tightness here. 
And then lastly, I would just say what is still the same, labor continues to be tight. That is the case practically everywhere we operate. And so that's a constraint that we would expect to see get better here over the next 12 to 18 months, but currently still see that as an area to watch out for."

Our funnels continue to be strong. And I would say that we're starting to see deal velocity slow a little bit. So it is clear that people are starting to think about where they're going to invest their cash. At least for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing robust demand and robust funding. 
Having said that, and in view of everything we read in the news as to you, we continue to watch that very closely to see whether that sustains going forward into '23. And of course, we're going to talk to you about that again in January. 
Now as it relates to our own exposure, specifically as it relates to energy, we continue for many reasons to take a very close look at our energy consumption, so also from a sustainability perspective. But now particularly, this becomes an area of focus for Europe. 
And in fact, we do not have a lot of heavy manufacturing, so energy-intensive manufacturing in Europe. It's mostly light assembly, and we have taken the measures to ensure energy supply continuity through the appropriate backup systems. 
And then in the event of, if you will, fuel rationing, whether that's gas or oil or otherwise, we also have contingency plans there to ensure that we're able to reduce our demand but still supply mission-critical capabilities, including manufacturing, should that become the case. 
So yes, it's something that we're closely focused on. Two, we've taken measures in order to ensure that we have supply and can provide supply continuity. And then lastly, we also have the contingency plans should the situation deteriorate."
