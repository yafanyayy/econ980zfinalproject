Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and continued the positive momentum from the first 3 quarters to provide a strong finish to 2021. We're pleased that revenue growth continue to rebound even as we experienced revenue headwinds from the accelerating shift of new business to our SaaS model. Total revenues grew 53%, with solid organic growth increasing to 9.2%. NIC continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter as well, with core revenue growth of 7.5%, excluding COVID-related revenues. As expected, COVID-related revenues declined sequentially from the third quarter of 2021 and were slightly above our plan at $16.6 million as the Omicron variant increased demand for testing in December and revenues from our new initiatives supporting rent relief programs in Virginia came online. 
Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the second consecutive quarter and were led by 144% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 28.1%, again reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 56 of the last 64 quarters. 
We continued to experience pressure on margins in Q4 as we have throughout the year as a result of several factors. Some low-margin revenues such as billable travel that declined substantially in 2020 due to the pandemic began to return in 2021. In addition, some expenses that also declined in 2020 have also started to return, including business travel, trade shows and employee health costs. 
Margins have also been impacted by the inclusion of NIC, including their lower-margin gross payments contracts and COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 23.6%. And while our accelerating move to the cloud continues to build long-term value, the increase in the SaaS mix of new business also weighed on our fourth quarter margins as SaaS accounted for 77% of our new contract volume in the quarter versus 73% last year. 
We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance in the market and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the fourth quarter, NIC was successful in competitive rebids for enterprise contracts in South Carolina and Indiana payments and with renewals or extensions of enterprise agreements in Mississippi, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas payments. We believe that Tyler's acquisition of NIC was a positive factor in the extension of these client relationships. 
In particular, the inclusion of our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata was a material differentiator in the successful competitive rebid for South Carolina. We had 9 combined sell-through wins in the quarter where Tyler products were sold through NIC state enterprise contracts or with influence from NIC state teams. These wins contained a number of Tyler products and services, including our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata, case management development platform, Power Pi and Teletrac, Vend Engine and NIC Payments, and generated over $1 million in new ARR for Tyler. 
We also continued to experience increased cross-selling opportunities across Tyler's product suites, especially for our enterprise data platform, and our 2 largest new SaaS deals in the fourth quarter were examples. The first deal was with the City of Lawrence, Kansas valued at approximately $4.3 million, and the second was with the city of Hammond, Indiana valued at approximately $3.8 million. Both new contracts included our enterprise ERP powered by Munis, enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov and enterprise data platform powered by Socrata Solutions, among others. 
In addition, we signed a new combination license and SaaS deal with the Colorado Division of Real Estate valued at nearly $1 million for our case management and development platform and enterprise data platform solutions as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. This is also a great example of not only our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler solutions in a single deal but also the ability to win follow-on deals with various agencies. As you recall, in Q2 of 2021, we signed a $9.3 million contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations for similar products, which paved the way for this deal with the Division of Real Estate. 
Other significant new SaaS arrangements signed this quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $2 million included: the city of Camas, Washington for enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions; Baton Rouge, Louisiana for enterprise justice and supervision solutions powered by Odyssey; the city of Taunton, Massachusetts for our enterprise ERP solution; Caldwell County, Texas for our enterprise justice and jury solutions; and the city of Snoqualmie, Washington for enterprise ERP solution. 
For on-premise license contracts, notable new signings included the Lea County Clerk of the Courts and Comptroller in Florida valued at approximately $2.9 million; and the city of Woodland, California valued at approximately $1.4 million for our enterprise ERP solution; and the cities of Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salem, Oregon for our enterprise public safety solutions, valued at approximately $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules of supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $433.5 million, up 53% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions. Non-GAAP revenues were $434.2 million, up 53.2%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues both grew 9.2%. Software licenses and services grew 21.1% or 4.6%, excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 144.1%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 28.1%. We added 135 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 71 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $74 million in total contract value. 
In Q4 of last year, we added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and 50 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $14.8 million in new annual recurring revenue. 
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 77% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 73% in Q4 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.9 years compared to 3.5 last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $137.1 million, up almost fivefold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.6 million, up 13.4%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues were [ 13% ]. 
For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.4 billion, up 63.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q4 was approximately $372 million, up 34%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $548 million, up 458% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $471 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 12.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $24 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 11.1%. Our bookings in the quarter were robust at $464 million, up 39.3%, including the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $347 million, up 4.2%. As a reminder, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020 included a large contract for tax software and appraisal services valued at approximately $18 million, making for a tough bookings comparison. For the year, bookings were approximately $1.8 billion, up 41.6% and, on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 11.7%. 
Our business continues to generate cash at a high level, and for the fourth quarter, cash from operations grew almost 30% and free cash flow grew 13.7% to $95.1 million. Our balance sheet also remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $87.5 million of our term debt, and since the NIC acquisition, we have repaid $395 million of debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.34 billion and cash and investments of $407.8 million and net leverage of approximately 2.07x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. 
Turning to 2022. Our focus continues to be on our strategic activities around our cloud transition on several fronts. Although this creates some short-term pressure on revenue growth and margins that Lynn will discuss in more detail, we believe the acceleration of this strategy is creating significant long-term value for shareholders and clients. 
Our 2022 annual guidance reflects the impact of these strategic activities and is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.83 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $36 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and Pandemic Rent Relief services. The TourHealth revenues are expected to continue through the first half of 2022, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue throughout the year. 
We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.09 and $4.26 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.41 and $7.58. 
To provide a little more color on our revenue guidance, we expect that our license revenues will decline in the mid-single digits in 2022, while subscription revenues will grow 25% to 30%. Excluding COVID-related revenues, subscriptions are expected to grow in the mid- to high 30s. Maintenance will be flat to down low single digits. Software services, appraisal services and hardware and other revenues are each expected to grow in the low to mid-teens. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."
309821,1765367189,2497536,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2022",2022-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance.

I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively, with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or above pre-COVID levels. It's also gratifying that our NIC operations are executing at a high level and that we're seeing early successes in achieving the go-to-market objectives we envisioned around the acquisition. 
For example, NIC was recently awarded an early 3-year extension to its Texas payments contract at existing rates. Similar to the South Carolina rebid, the inclusion of Tyler's enterprise data platform and, in particular, payment insights with fraud detection and prevention, proved to be a major factor in obtaining this early extension. 
We're very excited to expand NIC's portfolio of software solutions with the acquisition of US eDirect, which we completed last week. US eDirect has a market-leading AWS cloud-hosted outdoor reservation platform for the fast-growing campground and outdoor recreation management market, which complements our existing strength in the hunting and fishing license market. This combination will allow us to create a very competitive all-in-one outdoor solution, addressing an estimated $2 billion market while also expanding our payments opportunity. US eDirect is now part of our NIC division and we welcome their 60 team members to Tyler. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our accelerated move to the cloud, including the expected impact on our results in both the near term and the long term. As most of you know, we have operated in a hybrid model for many years, offering our core products in either an on-premises model with an upfront license and annual maintenance or a SaaS model with the software generally hosted in a Tyler data center and a multiyear subscription revenue stream. 
Since our first SaaS client, Oak Claire, Wisconsin, chose Tyler in 2000, the mix of clients choosing our SaaS model grew slowly but steadily as we pursued a cloud-agnostic approach to sales and let the market decide the pace at which it would move to the cloud. And as with many things in the public sector, our market has moved to the cloud more slowly than the private sector. In fact, it took until 2019 for the majority of our new business to come to us in the cloud, a year in which we also recognized an all-time high $100.2 million in license revenues. 
2019 was also the year in which we made the strategic decision to shift our future model from a cloud-agnostic approach to a cloud-first approach. In conjunction with that shift, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services and embarked on significant development efforts to optimize our key products to be efficiently deployed in the cloud through AWS with an ultimate goal of exiting our 2 proprietary data centers and eventually deploying all of our SaaS clients in the public cloud. 
Over the past 2 years, we've made substantial progress under our cloud-first approach. I'm pleased to report that we remain on target with our product development initiatives, with an expectation that all of our major products will be cloud-efficient or cloud-optimized by the end of 2023 or early 2024. In addition, almost every product we've added through acquisition in the last several years has been cloud-native. 
We've begun deploying some new SaaS clients in AWS as well as lifting and shifting a limited number of existing SaaS clients out of our data centers and into AWS. We've made changes to sales compensation to encourage cloud sales over licenses. In early 2021, we also created a new cloud strategy and operations team, which has responsibility for our overall cloud transformation, strategy and operations, including things like defining best practices for cloud development, operations and deployment to achieve the full value of our cloud initiative. 
And as we've embraced the cloud-first approach, our market has also continued to embrace the cloud at an increasing rate. In 2021, 71% of our new software contract value came to us in the cloud, with that percentage reaching 77% in the fourth quarter. And conversions of existing on-premises clients to the cloud have also reached new highs in each of the last 3 quarters. So clearly, our shift to the cloud is in sync with the market as clients recognize the many benefits of cloud-based solutions. 
This acceleration of our cloud transition is continuing as we move into 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, some of our major products, including enterprise ERP powered by Munis and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov, will almost exclusively be offered to new clients as cloud solutions. Other applications will follow. We expect that the percentage of new clients choosing the cloud model will continue to grow significantly in 2022, with the exception of public safety, where to date, there has been more market reluctance to move systems to the cloud. 
The general impacts of a SaaS transition on a software company financial model are generally understood. From a revenue perspective, there is initial headwind on as license revenue that is generally recognized upfront is replaced by a recurring subscription revenue stream. And unlike licenses, that recurring revenue stream is not recognized in full immediately. Rather, revenue recognition typically begins when customers go live with particular models, which can take several quarters. 
However, because the annual recurring revenues from a subscription client are approximately 1.8x to 2x the annual maintenance the same client would generate in a license deal, the SaaS revenue stream is significantly higher over the life of the client. To some extent, we have experienced this headwind for several years but the impact is increasing as the shift accelerates. Over the next several years, as Brian mentioned, license and maintenance revenue will continue to decline while subscriptions will accelerate. For example, in 2019, maintenance revenues were 45% higher than subscriptions. In 2022, subscriptions will surpass maintenance revenues. 
From a margin perspective, there are multiple short-term headwinds as well. License revenues have very high margins with immediate impact. And as they decline, margins are negatively impacted until the subscription revenue stream reaches the point where it offsets those lost licenses. In addition, we will experience some margin headwind from bubble costs around the transition from our internal data centers to the AWS hosting environment. 
We currently host almost all of our more than 5,400 SaaS clients in 1 of 2 main proprietary data centers. We have certain fixed costs associated with running those data centers even as we transition the hosting of new and existing clients to AWS. Until we completely exit 1 and ultimately both of our data centers, we will incur some duplicative costs that put pressure on margins. Once we are in AWS with products that are architected to operate more efficiently in the public cloud, we will see an uplift in margins. 
With that backdrop, I'd like to turn to a closer look at our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our revenue growth outlook is solid, representing the continuing return to and growth over pre-pandemic levels and our increasing competitive position. The midpoint of our guidance would represent approximately 16% total growth and 9.5% organic growth, even in light of the continued accelerated shift of new business to SaaS. We expect that approximately 80% of our new software contract mix in 2022 will be SaaS. 
From a margin perspective, the midpoint of our 2022 guidance implies non-GAAP operating margin contraction of approximately 160 basis points. That said, our implied 2022 non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with or even slightly higher than our 2021 Q4 operating margin as the major factors impacting margins began before this year. I'd like to break down a few of those factors. The first material category of margin pressures we consider to be part of our long-term strategy of becoming a cloud-first company. The impact of the year-over-year increase in our SaaS business mix, net of on-premises conversions, along with increasing bubble costs in 2022, will negatively impact operating profit by approximately $28 million to $30 million. 
The second significant category of factors causing margin pressure is made up of costs and low margin revenues that experienced reductions during the pandemic but have been slowly returning since the end of last year and which we've discussed on prior calls. These include trade shows, sales-related travel costs and some billable travel. Importantly, some costs have not and will not return to pre-COVID levels. 
The third category of factors include some onetime or nondiscretionary costs. We, like virtually every company, are experiencing the effects of labor market disruptions and increased wage pressure. And health care costs also continue to rise as a result of health care inflation combined with the catch-up of expenses from health care that were deferred during the pandemic. We've posted on our website, with the supplemental quarterly data, a summary of these margin challenges. The estimated total impact of all these items accounts for approximately 290 basis points of operating margin impact in our 2022 outlook. 
Looking beyond 2022, we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted by some of these factors, particularly declining license revenues and cloud transition bubble costs. We believe that operating margin pressures from the cloud transition will bottom out in 2023, and that beginning in 2024, we will start to see accelerating revenue growth and return to margin expansion. 
The timing of the cloud transition varies by products as some products are further along, creating something of an ebb and flow in the short-term headwinds and long-term tailwinds. For example, for enterprise ERP, our largest and most profitable product, revenue growth slowed to approximately 8.5% in 2021 and is expected to grow approximately 8% in 2022 as the mix of new business significantly shifted to SaaS. For example, in 2019, the new business mix was 50%. Fourth quarter last year, it was over 90%. However, the early expectations are for that product's growth to accelerate to around 11% in 2023 as it begins to reach the other side of this transition and experience the SaaS uplift. 
As we head into 2022, I am more excited than ever about Tyler's future. It's amazing to think that it took 19 years from the time we entered the government technology market in 1998 to surpass $800 million in revenues in 2017. And in 2022, we will have added the next $1 billion of revenues in just 5 years. In 2017, recurring revenues accounted for 63% of total revenues. In 2022, they will exceed 80% and approach $1.5 billion, creating long-term value. 
We're executing on our strategic long-term cloud transition, and we have an incredible platform as the clear leader in the massive public sector market. We have reorganized and aligned our Tyler payments team with NIC's payment team to further capitalize on this opportunity. Our elevated pre-pandemic investments are paying off as our market environment is strong and our competitive position and win rates across our core applications remain extremely high. 
One of our biggest assets is our existing client base with over 37,000 installations across more than 12,000 locations, something that takes decades to establish. And we are poised to take advantage of cross-selling and payment opportunities to accelerate growth and expand margins as we complete our transition to the cloud. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

I would say that one of the -- obviously, in public, in the local government, one of the biggest revenue streams is property taxes. Often, that accounts for more than half of their budget and generally, property values remain strong. Real estate markets are strong so there's not a lot of pressure there. 
So the overall environmental -- the environment backdrop is strong, and I would say that doesn't really include a lot of uplift from federal stimulus yet. We've seen handful of deals this last quarter that were specifically identified as coming from or being funded with stimulus money. There's certainly some indirect funding that may not be used directly for a Tyler purchase that relieves pressures elsewhere in the budget and frees up funds for money they'd like to spend with Tyler. 
But in our view, the vast majority of the stimulus money has not yet been spent or even committed yet. With the CARES Act money, they have until the -- or the American Rescue Plan money, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend it. And I think many governments are still in the very early stages of figuring out where they're going to spend that."

One of the things that we didn't point out in our prepared comments was a very specific deal of the 9 that we talked about. 
And this was a deal that NIC helped using their state enterprise contracts, the contracts with the state of Arkansas, where we've got a VendEngine deal where VendEngine is going to be handling all the online and phone-banked deposits in the state-wide corrections contract. That's about $800,000 in ARR. 
And what's -- I think what's particularly exciting for me is NIC is a company that we acquired in April and VendEngine is a company that we acquired in September. And in the first quarter, those 2 teams got together as part of -- we've talked in the past about some of the efforts we were doing around sales and education, and we're able to already get a deal of this size. I think it's an example of the tip of the iceberg of where we can go not only with NIC but all the other acquisitions that we do for strategic purposes. It's -- again, it's pretty exciting."

So that's an example where we provided value to NIC really out of the gate. I do think as we continue -- you talk about payments, yes, like you look at the state of Florida, we're going to help expand that payments revenue by having that hunting license and going through our local contacts. We put our payments teams together. Today, I generally just consider, Tyler, it's 1 payments organization.

But you have to keep in mind that our sales cycles are long. And it's not uncommon that a deal from the time that process really gets started to the time we sign a contract can be 1 year, 1.5 years.

And I just try to remember how things happen, and I almost put everything in reference to pre COVID or post COVID. But I was thinking about this the other day, but at Tyler, these haven't been lost years. We've been working hard and we've been investing. 
And we knew that this market was going to be rebounding -- and we talked about it as COVID started about, we went back to the Great Recession, and we had that great big boost out -- coming out of the Great Recession. And we were anticipating this and we planned for it. We invested in it and, at the same time, made our investments into the cloud. And I think seeing the market return, yes, the stimulus money is out there. I think the state and local government budgets are very robust. 
I think we're in -- our competitive position across all our products is an all-time high. We are at the point now where I'm starting to see the -- coming out of the other side of the SaaS transition. It's not happening tomorrow. It's not happening in the next couple of quarters. But my reference to what's going on at, for example, up at Munis and we see the uplift that's coming from that. And so that's the stuff that gives me confidence. The acquisitions that we're doing, the cross-selling that's going on, the interactions that's going on with our teams. 
One thing we've been focused on really a lot in the last few years is an idea that I call One Tyler. And that's that -- it's not where our enterprise group and our just -- we're all together and we're all pushing in the same direction, and there's opportunities that we need to start tapping into more and more. And we're starting to see this in deals. And we've done it very successfully for a long time. But as I say, our greatest assets are customer base. It doesn't take years to develop, it takes decades to develop. 
And the opportunities we have there with our new products, as we move to SaaS, as we continue to do acquisitions, things like VendEngine, US eDirect, there's just -- there's so many opportunities out there. And I just like where we sit right now. And as you can tell, I get a little excited. I think a year ago, I was talking about cautious optimism and then I was talking about tempered excitement. And I think right now, I'm just flat-out excited about the future.

And then on the margin side, I think you guys did a wonderful job laying out the cost hit that you're taking this year and bridging the margins on a like-for-like basis without it. Is this the year that margins trough in the business? And then next, as you absorb those bubble costs, as you absorb the comeback COVID costs, and then in '23, you start to go back to seeing margin leverage?

I think margins will trough may be the right word or sort of balance out at this level through 2023, and I think you'll start to see the uplift coming out of there. On your question around subscriptions and the uplift, of course, embedded in our subscription line is also transaction-based revenues. Those will grow not at the same rate as some of our subscriptions, which is just coming in with our SaaS contracts. 
We talked about on the call, we've grown in double digits. 56 out of 64 quarters, we've been consistently at 20%-plus. And I think as we make the transition and start coming out on the other side, I think you'll start seeing that. We talked about a few milestones in my prepared comments. One of the things that it's also exciting to me, when I look at our mix of recurring revenue versus where it was 5 years ago and you talk about our growth, it took us from 1998 to 2019 to get to $1 billion in total revenues. And in 2022, I think we're going to do right at about $1 billion in subscriptions alone. That's part of the excitement that I see, and I see that continuing to grow at a pretty healthy clip in the near future."

I think the impact as you accelerate those transitions are very clear and well known and well understood. I wanted to double click into the cross-sell opportunity around payments, specifically around going into the existing installed base of Tyler software customers that potentially are using a different payment source and really convincing that base of customer to add on payments. 
Is the insertion point primarily upon a renewal? Is there a shorter sales cycle potentially to add on payments? Or -- and do you have a dedicated team now that is going in and trying to cross sell, upsell existing Tyler software payments? A little more color just around that opportunity. It seems like it's a very big opportunity encouraged by the 9 deals. You talked about bundling. Those sound like more like new deals.

I'll try to get to the ones I recall. If I missed one, just come back to me. The sales cycle will vary a little bit with payments, and some of that will be dependent upon the customer. And payments, there's a number of things that can impact that. The current providers that our clients might be using is one. But you're right, it is one of our larger opportunities in payments. While we've got some great new ground with NIC and, for example, the Florida contract and going locally, it's one of the focuses and emphasis. 
For example, we talked -- there's been a lot of questions about what's going on with Munis on this call. It's considered to be one of their primary key growth drivers in the next few years is payments. And there is a significant amount of dedicated resources that are focused on that and going back into that installed channel. So you're exactly right there. 
What we bring with NIC in terms of payments and our now more complete solution, I think, is something that's pretty important. One thing that we had really built out was electronic bill presentment and payment. And that's a very big differentiator in the market, and it's something that NIC was not as strong at. And obviously, they were very strong with their payment engine and gateway stuff, things that we needed to build. I think we've talked before, where we both brought strengths here. We've got the ability through our connections with our proprietary products, either UB and tax collections and we've got those relationships and we can start going to drive those sales. 
And so you're right. It's one of our larger strategic initiatives. It's getting a lot of attention and focus. I mentioned how we just recently reorganized internally the payments organization, bringing 45 payment resources within Tyler and getting them aligned with the NIC resources working on go-to-market strategies, looking at the size of the market. And so it's something that we are -- I can assure you we're actively pursuing."

I mentioned last year, obviously, the NIC deal, and I made my comments where there were some other deals in the pipeline. US eDirect is a good example. This was something that was not in the pipeline last year. We talked about a little bit higher bar. I think we probably had a little bit higher bar right now. But I'm also comfortable with where we sit with our balance sheet and our debt. We paid down $395 million last year. Our net leverage is right around 2x, give or take, a little bit.

Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and continued the positive momentum from the first 3 quarters to provide a strong finish to 2021. We're pleased that revenue growth continue to rebound even as we experienced revenue headwinds from the accelerating shift of new business to our SaaS model. Total revenues grew 53%, with solid organic growth increasing to 9.2%. NIC continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter as well, with core revenue growth of 7.5%, excluding COVID-related revenues. As expected, COVID-related revenues declined sequentially from the third quarter of 2021 and were slightly above our plan at $16.6 million as the Omicron variant increased demand for testing in December and revenues from our new initiatives supporting rent relief programs in Virginia came online.  
Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the second consecutive quarter and were led by 144% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 28.1%, again reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 56 of the last 64 quarters.  
We continued to experience pressure on margins in Q4 as we have throughout the year as a result of several factors. Some low-margin revenues such as billable travel that declined substantially in 2020 due to the pandemic began to return in 2021. In addition, some expenses that also declined in 2020 have also started to return, including business travel, trade shows and employee health costs.  
Margins have also been impacted by the inclusion of NIC, including their lower-margin gross payments contracts and COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 23.6%. And while our accelerating move to the cloud continues to build long-term value, the increase in the SaaS mix of new business also weighed on our fourth quarter margins as SaaS accounted for 77% of our new contract volume in the quarter versus 73% last year.  
We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance in the market and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the fourth quarter, NIC was successful in competitive rebids for enterprise contracts in South Carolina and Indiana payments and with renewals or extensions of enterprise agreements in Mississippi, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas payments. We believe that Tyler's acquisition of NIC was a positive factor in the extension of these client relationships.  
In particular, the inclusion of our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata was a material differentiator in the successful competitive rebid for South Carolina. We had 9 combined sell-through wins in the quarter where Tyler products were sold through NIC state enterprise contracts or with influence from NIC state teams. These wins contained a number of Tyler products and services, including our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata, case management development platform powered by entellitrak, VendEngine and NIC Payments, and generated over $1 million in new ARR for Tyler.  
We also continued to experience increased cross-selling opportunities across Tyler's product suites, especially for our enterprise data platform, and our 2 largest new SaaS deals in the fourth quarter were examples. The first deal was with the City of Lawrence, Kansas valued at approximately $4.3 million, and the second was with the city of Hammond, Indiana valued at approximately $3.8 million. Both new contracts included our enterprise ERP powered by Munis, enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov and enterprise data platform powered by Socrata Solutions, among others.  
In addition, we signed a new combination license and SaaS deal with the Colorado Division of Real Estate valued at nearly $1 million for our case management and development platform and enterprise data platform solutions as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. This is also a great example of not only our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler solutions in a single deal but also the ability to win follow-on deals with various agencies. As you recall, in Q2 of 2021, we signed a $9.3 million contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations for similar products, which paved the way for this deal with the Division of Real Estate.  
Other significant new SaaS arrangements signed this quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $2 million included: the city of Camas, Washington for enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions; Baton Rouge, Louisiana for enterprise justice and supervision solutions powered by Odyssey; the city of Taunton, Massachusetts for our enterprise ERP solution; Caldwell County, Texas for our enterprise justice and jury solutions; and the city of Snoqualmie, Washington for our enterprise ERP solution.  
For on-premise license contracts, notable new signings included the Lea County Clerk of the Courts and Comptroller in Florida valued at approximately $2.9 million; and the city of Woodland, California valued at approximately $1.4 million for our enterprise ERP solution; and the cities of Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salem, Oregon for our enterprise public safety solutions, valued at approximately $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules of supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.  
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $433.5 million, up 53% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions. Non-GAAP revenues were $434.2 million, up 53.2%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues both grew 9.2%. Software licenses and services grew 21.1% or 4.6%, excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 144.1%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 28.1%. We added 135 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 71 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $74 million in total contract value.  
In Q4 of last year, we added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and 50 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $14.8 million in new annual recurring revenue.  
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 77% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 73% in Q4 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.9 years compared to 3.5 last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $137.1 million, up almost fivefold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.6 million, up 13.4%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 14%.
For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.4 billion, up 63.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q4 was approximately $372 million, up 34%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $548 million, up 458% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $471 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud.  
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 12.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $24 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 11.1%. Our bookings in the quarter were robust at $464 million, up 39.3%, including the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $347 million, up 4.2%. As a reminder, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020 included a large contract for tax software and appraisal services valued at approximately $18 million, making for a tough bookings comparison. For the year, bookings were approximately $1.8 billion, up 41.6% and, on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 11.7%.  
Our business continues to generate cash at a high level, and for the fourth quarter, cash from operations grew almost 30% and free cash flow grew 13.7% to $95.1 million. Our balance sheet also remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $87.5 million of our term debt, and since the NIC acquisition, we have repaid $395 million of debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.34 billion and cash and investments of $407.8 million and net leverage of approximately 2.07x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA.  
Turning to 2022. Our focus continues to be on our strategic activities around our cloud transition on several fronts. Although this creates some short-term pressure on revenue growth and margins that Lynn will discuss in more detail, we believe the acceleration of this strategy is creating significant long-term value for shareholders and clients.  
Our 2022 annual guidance reflects the impact of these strategic activities and is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.83 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $36 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are expected to continue through the first half of 2022, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue throughout the year.  
We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.09 and $4.26 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.41 and $7.58.  
To provide a little more color on our revenue guidance, we expect that our license revenues will decline in the mid-single digits in 2022, while subscription revenues will grow 25% to 30%. Excluding COVID-related revenues, subscriptions are expected to grow in the mid- to high 30s. Maintenance will be flat to down low single digits. Software services, appraisal services and hardware and other revenues are each expected to grow in the low to mid-teens. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."
309821,1765367189,2497722,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2022",2022-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively, with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or",1896,"Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively, with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or above pre-COVID levels. It's also gratifying that our NIC operations are executing at a high level and that we're seeing early successes in achieving the go-to-market objectives we envisioned around the acquisition.  
For example, NIC was recently awarded an early 3-year extension to its Texas payments contract at existing rates. Similar to the South Carolina rebid, the inclusion of Tyler's enterprise data platform and in particular, payment insights with fraud detection and prevention, proved to be a major factor in obtaining this early extension. We're very excited to expand NIC's portfolio of software solutions with the acquisition of US eDirect, which we completed last week. US eDirect has a market-leading AWS cloud-hosted outdoor reservation platform for the fast-growing campground and outdoor recreation management market, which complements our existing strength in the hunting and fishing license market. This combination will allow us to create a very competitive all-in-one outdoor solution, addressing an estimated $2 billion market while also expanding our payments opportunity.  US eDirect is now part of our NIC division and we welcome their 60 team members to Tyler.  
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our accelerated move to the cloud, including the expected impact on our results in both the near term and the long term. As most of you know, we have operated in a hybrid model for many years, offering our core products in either an on-premises model with an upfront license and annual maintenance or a SaaS model with the software generally hosted in a Tyler data center and a multiyear subscription revenue stream.  
Since our first SaaS client, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, chose Tyler in 2000, the mix of clients choosing our SaaS model grew slowly but steadily as we pursued a cloud-agnostic approach to sales and let the market decide the pace at which it would move to the cloud. And as with many things in the public sector, our market has moved to the cloud more slowly than the private sector. In fact, it took until 2019 for the majority of our new business to come to us in the cloud, a year in which we also recognized an all-time high $100.2 million in license revenues.  
2019 was also the year in which we made the strategic decision to shift our future model from a cloud-agnostic approach to a cloud-first approach. In conjunction with that shift, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services and embarked on significant development efforts to optimize our key products to be efficiently deployed in the cloud through AWS with an ultimate goal of exiting our 2 proprietary data centers and eventually deploying all of our SaaS clients in the public cloud.  
Over the past 2 years, we've made substantial progress under our cloud-first approach. I'm pleased to report that we remain on target with our product development initiatives, with an expectation that all of our major products will be cloud-efficient or cloud-optimized by the end of 2023 or early 2024. In addition, almost every product we've added through acquisition in the last several years has been cloud-native.  
We've begun deploying some new SaaS clients in AWS as well as lifting and shifting a limited number of existing SaaS clients out of our data centers and into AWS. We've made changes to sales compensation to encourage cloud sales over licenses. In early 2021, we also created a new cloud strategy and operations team, which has responsibility for our overall cloud transformation, strategy and operations, including things like defining best practices for cloud development, operations and deployment to achieve the full value of our cloud initiative.  
And as we've embraced the cloud-first approach, our market has also continued to embrace the cloud at an increasing rate. In 2021, 71% of our new software contract value came to us in the cloud, with that percentage reaching 77% in the fourth quarter. And conversions of existing on-premises clients to the cloud have also reached new highs in each of the last 3 quarters. So clearly, our shift to the cloud is in sync with the market as clients recognize the many benefits of cloud-based solutions.  
This acceleration of our cloud transition is continuing as we move into 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, some of our major products, including enterprise ERP powered by Munis and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov, will almost exclusively be offered to new clients as cloud solutions. Other applications will follow. We expect that the percentage of new clients choosing the cloud model will continue to grow significantly in 2022, with the exception of public safety, where to date, there has been more market reluctance to move systems to the cloud.  
The general impacts of a SaaS transition on a software company financial model are generally understood. From a revenue perspective, there is initial headwind as license revenue that is generally recognized upfront is replaced by a recurring subscription revenue stream. And unlike licenses, that recurring revenue stream is not recognized in full immediately. Rather, revenue recognition typically begins when customers go live with particular models, which can take several quarters.  
However, because the annual recurring revenues from a subscription client are approximately 1.8x to 2x the annual maintenance the same client would generate in a license deal, the SaaS revenue stream is significantly higher over the life of the client. To some extent, we have experienced this headwind for several years but the impact is increasing as the shift accelerates. Over the next several years, as Brian mentioned, license and maintenance revenue will continue to decline while subscriptions will accelerate. For example, in 2019, maintenance revenues were 45% higher than subscriptions. In 2022, subscriptions will surpass maintenance revenues.  
From a margin perspective, there are multiple short-term headwinds as well. License revenues have very high margins with immediate impact. And as they decline, margins are negatively impacted until the subscription revenue stream reaches the point where it offsets those lost licenses. In addition, we will experience some margin headwind from bubble costs around the transition from our internal data centers to the AWS hosting environment.  
We currently host almost all of our more than 5,400 SaaS clients in 1 of 2 main proprietary data centers. We have certain fixed costs associated with running those data centers even as we transition the hosting of new and existing clients to AWS. Until we completely exit 1 and ultimately both of our data centers, we will incur some duplicative costs that put pressure on margins. Once we are in AWS with products that are architected to operate more efficiently in the public cloud, we will see an uplift in margins.  
With that backdrop, I'd like to turn to a closer look at our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our revenue growth outlook is solid, representing the continuing return to and growth over pre-pandemic levels and our increasing competitive position. The midpoint of our guidance would represent approximately 16% total growth and 9.5% organic growth, even in light of the continued accelerated shift of new business to SaaS. We expect that approximately 80% of our new software contract mix in 2022 will be SaaS.  
From a margin perspective, the midpoint of our 2022 guidance implies non-GAAP operating margin contraction of approximately 160 basis points. That said, our implied 2022 non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with or even slightly higher than our 2021 Q4 operating margin as the major factors impacting margins began before this year. I'd like to break down a few of those factors. The first material category of margin pressures we consider to be part of our long-term strategy of becoming a cloud-first company. The impact of the year-over-year increase in our SaaS business mix, net of on-premises conversions, along with increasing bubble costs in 2022, will negatively impact operating profit by approximately $28 million to $30 million.  
The second significant category of factors causing margin pressure is made up of costs and low-margin revenues that experienced reductions during the pandemic but have been slowly returning since the end of last year and which we've discussed on prior calls. These include trade shows, sales-related travel costs and some billable travel. Importantly, some costs have not and will not return to pre-COVID levels.  
The third category of factors include some onetime or nondiscretionary costs. We, like virtually every company, are experiencing the effects of labor market disruptions and increased wage pressure. And health care costs also continue to rise as a result of health care inflation combined with the catch-up of expenses from health care that were deferred during the pandemic. We've posted on our website, with the supplemental quarterly data, a summary of these margin challenges. The estimated total impact of all these items accounts for approximately 290 basis points of operating margin impact in our 2022 outlook.  
Looking beyond 2022, we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted by some of these factors, particularly declining license revenues and cloud transition bubble costs. We believe that operating margin pressures from the cloud transition will bottom out in 2023, and that beginning in 2024, we will start to see accelerating revenue growth and return to margin expansion.  
The timing of the cloud transition varies by products as some products are further along, creating something of an ebb and flow in the short-term headwinds and long-term tailwinds. For example, for enterprise ERP, our largest and most profitable product, revenue growth slowed to approximately 8.5% in 2021 and is expected to grow approximately 8% in 2022 as the mix of new business significantly shifted to SaaS. For example, in 2019, the new business mix was 50%. Fourth quarter last year, it was over 90%. However, the early expectations are for that product's growth to accelerate to around 11% in 2023 as it begins to reach the other side of this transition and experience the SaaS uplift.  
As we head into 2022, I am more excited than ever about Tyler's future. It's amazing to think that it took 19 years from the time we entered the government technology market in 1998 to surpass $800 million in revenues in 2017. And in 2022, we will have added the next $1 billion of revenues in just 5 years. In 2017, recurring revenues accounted for 63% of total revenues. In 2022, they will exceed 80% and approach $1.5 billion, creating long-term value.  
We're executing on our strategic long-term cloud transition, and we have an incredible platform as the clear leader in the massive public sector market. We have reorganized and aligned our Tyler payments team with NIC's payment team to further capitalize on this opportunity. Our elevated pre-pandemic investments are paying off as our market environment is strong and our competitive position and win rates across our core applications remain extremely high.  
One of our biggest assets is our existing client base with over 37,000 installations across more than 12,000 locations, something that takes decades to establish. And we are poised to take advantage of cross-selling and payment opportunities to accelerate growth and expand margins as we complete our transition to the cloud. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

I don't have the percentage growth in government budgets at my fingertips, but the backdrop is strong. I would say that one of the -- obviously, in public, in the local government, one of the biggest revenue streams is property taxes. Often, that accounts for more than half of their budget and generally, property values remain strong. Real estate markets are strong so there's not a lot of pressure there. 
So the overall environmental -- the environment backdrop is strong, and I would say that doesn't really include a lot of uplift from federal stimulus yet. We've seen handful of deals this last quarter that were specifically identified as coming from or being funded with stimulus money. There's certainly some indirect funding that may not be used directly for a Tyler purchase that relieves pressures elsewhere in the budget and frees up funds for money they'd like to spend with Tyler. 
But in our view, the vast majority of the stimulus money has not yet been spent or even committed yet. With the CARES Act money, they have until the -- or the American Rescue Plan money, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend it. And I think many governments are still in the very early stages of figuring out where they're going to spend that."

That's about $800,000 in ARR. 
And what's -- I think what's particularly exciting for me is NIC is a company that we acquired in April and VendEngine is a company that we acquired in September.

I guess I wanted to start by tackling fiscal '22 margins from a slightly different angle.

And then secondly, as some of those COVID revenues fall off in the first half, given what those margins look like, should we get maybe a little bit of upward opportunity in margins with the falloff of those revenues?"

I was -- I talk sometimes in my personal life about the last couple of years with COVID and sometimes, I sort of call them as ""the lost years."" And I just try to remember how things happened, and I almost put everything in reference to what was pre-COVID or post-COVID. But I was thinking about this the other day, but at Tyler, these haven't been lost years. We've been working hard and we've been investing. 
And we knew that this market was going to be rebounding. And we talked about it as COVID started about -- we went back to the Great Recession, and we had that great big boost out of -- coming out of the Great Recession. And we were anticipating this and we planned for it. We invested in it and, at the same time, made our investments into the cloud. And I think seeing the market return, yes, the stimulus money is out there. I think the state and local government budgets are very robust. 
I think we're in -- our competitive position across all our products is at an all-time high. We are at the point now where I'm starting to see the -- coming out of the other side of the SaaS transition. It's not happening tomorrow. It's not happening in the next couple of quarters. But my reference to what's going on at, for example, up at Munis and we see the uplift that's coming from that. And so that's the stuff that gives me confidence, the acquisitions that we're doing, the cross-selling that's going on, the interactions that's going on with our teams. 
One thing we've been focused on really a lot in the last few years is an idea that I call One Tyler. And that's that -- it's not where our enterprise group and our just -- we're all together and we're all pushing in the same direction, and there's opportunities that we need to start tapping into more and more. And we're starting to see this in deals. And we've done it very successfully for a long time. But as I say, our greatest assets are customer base. It doesn't take years to develop, it takes decades to develop. 
And the opportunities we have there with our new products, as we move to SaaS, as we continue to do acquisitions, things like VendEngine, US eDirect, there's just -- there's so many opportunities out there. And I just like where we sit right now. And as you can tell, I get a little excited. I think a year ago, I was talking about cautious optimism and then I was talking about tempered excitement. And I think right now, I'm just flat-out excited about the future. 
We're going to have a -- we're going to see some ripples through our financials over the next 2 years as the SaaS transition goes on, but we're making significant progress and we know where we're going to be on the other side."

And then on the margin side, I think you guys did a wonderful job laying out the cost hit that you're taking this year and bridging the margins on a like-for-like basis without it. Is this the year that margins trough in the business? And then next, as you absorb those bubble costs, as you absorb the comeback COVID costs, and then in '23, you start to go back to seeing margin leverage?

On your question around subscriptions and the uplift, of course, embedded in our subscription line is also transaction-based revenues. Those will grow not at the same rate as some of our subscriptions, which is just coming in with our SaaS contracts. 
We talked about on the call, we've grown in double digits. 56 out of 64 quarters, we've been consistently at 20%-plus. And I think as we make the transition and start coming out on the other side, I think you'll start seeing that. We talked about a few milestones in my prepared comments. One of the things that it's also exciting to me, when I look at our mix of recurring revenue versus where it was 5 years ago and you talk about our growth, it took us from 1998 to 2019 to get to $1 billion in total revenues. And in 2022, I think we're going to do right at about $1 billion in subscriptions alone.

In payments, there's a number of things that can impact that. The current providers that our clients might be using is one. But you're right, it is one of our larger opportunities in payments. While we've got some great new ground with NIC and, for example, the Florida contract and going locally, it's one of the focuses and emphasis. 
For example, we talked -- there's been a lot of questions about what's going on with Munis on this call. It's considered to be one of their primary key growth drivers in the next few years is payments. And there is a significant amount of dedicated resources that are focused on that and going back into that installed channel. So you're exactly right there. 
What we bring with NIC in terms of payments and our now more complete solution, I think, is something that's pretty important. One thing that we had really built out was electronic bill presentment and payment. And that's a very big differentiator in the market, and it's something that NIC was not as strong at. And obviously, they were very strong with their payment engine and gateway stuff, things that we needed to build. I think we've talked before, where we both brought strengths here. We've got the ability through our connections with our proprietary products, either [ UB ] and tax collections and we've got those relationships and we can start going to drive those sales. 
And so you're right. It's one of our larger strategic initiatives. It's getting a lot of attention and focus. I mentioned how we just recently reorganized internally the payments organization, bringing 45 payment resources within Tyler and getting them aligned with the NIC resources working on go-to-market strategies, looking at the size of the market. And so it's something that we are -- I can assure you we're actively pursuing."

Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first",665,"Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first quarter, with core revenue growth of 13%, excluding COVID-related revenues. NIC's growth was boosted by revenues under the new statewide payments contract in Florida and in particular, by revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State that are concentrated in the first quarter. NIC's COVID-related revenues were in line with our expectations at $20.6 million. 
Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 140% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew a robust 33.8%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 57 of the last 65 quarters. 
We're particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth even as we saw an acceleration of the shift in our new software contract mix from licenses to SaaS. In Q1, 80% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 66% in Q1 last year. 
As we outlined on our last earnings call, while our move to the cloud builds long-term value, margins compressed in Q1, reflecting the new business mix shift, the inclusion of NIC and in particular, their COVID-related revenues, as well as expenses related to the cloud transition. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 24.3% but increased 70 basis points sequentially from Q4 of 2021. 
We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the first quarter, NIC successfully extended our enterprise contract in Alabama. And in April, we extended our enterprise agreement with New Jersey. NIC also signed a new 5-year SaaS deal with the State of Mississippi to provide our NIC cannabis licensing platform valued at approximately $4.3 million. 
We continue to experience success with sell-through deals of Tyler products through NIC's state relationships. In Q1, those deals included sales of our data and insights platform to the state of Vermont and our entellitrak platform for Veterans Affairs in Alabama. We also signed agreements for NIC's payments platform with existing Tyler clients in Hillsboro County, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Glendale, California. 
Our largest new deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement with the San Diego Association of Governments for Enterprise [ EV ] powered by Munis solution, along with our data and insight solution valued at approximately $4.9 million, win five notable SaaS deals, each with a total contract value greater than $2 million with Glen County, Georgia for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World Solution; the cities of Rialto, California and Alamagordo, New Mexico for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis; and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov; and the cities of Mansfield and Burson in Texas for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution. 
Our largest license deal in Q1 was a $2.7 million agreement with the Utah Department of Public Safety, our first public safety deployment in the state of Utah. The deal includes enterprise law enforcement records, mobile, field mobile, enforcement mobile and public safety analytics. We also signed four other notable license arrangements in the quarter, each with a total contract value -- than $1 million with the St. Johns County property appraiser in Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World, the city of Elmhurst, Illinois for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, St. Mary's County government in Maryland for our enterprise public safety, powered by New World and Data and insight solutions, and the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia for our enforcement mobile powered by Brazeau solution. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated guidance for 2022."
309821,1777397599,2546434,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $456.1 million, up 54.7% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth was the highest since Q4 of 2016 at 12.8%. Software licenses and services grew 24.7% or 3.7%, excluding NIC. 
Subscription revenues rose 139.5% with very strong organic growth of 33.8%. We added 149 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 88 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $76 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and had 39 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $16.2 million in new ARR. 
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 66% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.0 years last year. 
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $150.9 million, up 461%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 9.8%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.2 million, up 16.9%. 
For the first quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.45 billion, up 63.6%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $378.1 million, up 25.1%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $603.7 million, up 461%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $468.1 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.76 billion, up 13.8%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $26.3 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.1%. 
Bookings in the quarter were strong at approximately $419 million, up 70.1% including the transaction-based revenues at NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $283 million, up 14.7%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 65% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 21.7%. If our weighted average contract term for new SaaS contracts has been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 17.1%. 
Cash from operations declined this quarter by 25.3% to $53.5 million, mainly due to changes in working capital related to higher payments of accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments related to stock-based compensation. Free cash flow declined by 33.5% to $41 million due to the decrease in cash from operations and somewhat higher capital spending this quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $20 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $415 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.32 billion and cash and investments of $322.6 million and net leverage of approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. 
As Lynn mentioned earlier, we're off to a great start in 2022, resulting in an improvement in our outlook for the full year. As a result, we have raised our 2022 annual revenue and earnings guidance as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $40 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are currently expected to continue through the second quarter of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue through the third quarter. 
We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.92 and $4.08 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.48 and $7.64. 
Based on updated assumptions regarding additional interest rate hikes this year, we have increased our estimated -- expense for the year by $3.4 million to $23 million, with an impact on non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.06 a share. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. 
Finally, before I turn the call back to Lynn, I'd like to announce that [ Hala Elsherbini ], will be joining Tyler as Senior Director of Investor Relations, effective May 9. Many of you have worked with Hala in the past, and we're very excited to have an IR professional with Hala's experience and knowledge of Tyler join our team. Lynn?"

I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the year. Activity in our public sector market continues to trend positively, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. 
We remain on track with our strategic initiatives, including our development projects to optimize our products for more efficient deployment in the cloud and our cloud-first approach to sales, which we believe will create significant long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong and we continue to be opportunistic with regard to capital allocation. We're excited about the acquisition of [ USD Direct ] in February, which significantly expands our outdoor recreation portfolio, allowing us to offer an extensive all-in-one outdoor recreation solution that will seamlessly integrate with our NIC payments platform. 
While we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, we are heavily focused on the integration and execution around the acquisitions we've completed over the last 2 years, making the bar on new acquisitions at this time relatively high. 
Last Thursday marked the 1-year anniversary of our landmark acquisition of NIC. As I reflect on the acquisition and all that we have accomplished as a -- entity over the last 12 months, I can truly say that it has exceeded our expectations, which were already high. 
Our teams have come together as one unified organization and our collective excitement about the opportunities that the combination unlocks has continued to grow. We've integrated our payments teams and have refined our strategy to pursue what we believe is a huge TAM in government payments. 
As we've discussed, we're winning new business with sell-throughs into our respective client bases. In this quarter, we doubled the number of sell-through opportunities in our pipeline. We look forward to continuing to report on our progress in the second year of our combination. 
The challenges of today's labor market continue to be an area of significant focus for us. While we added 195 new team members in the first quarter, we currently have a higher-than-normal number of open positions. Although our open positions have a short-term positive impact on margins, we have aggressive hiring plans for the balance of the year to support our growth. 
Finally, we're extremely excited to host clients live and in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in Indianapolis for May 15 through May 18. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

There's, I think, two things around that. 
One, as we pointed out, the Florida contract for statewide payments with NIC, which is a new contract, is ramping up, but there were some revenues in Q1 that are specific to Q1 around filings -- revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State in Florida. And that added, I think, roughly close to $6.5 million of revenue in subscriptions in Q1. And so actually accounted for a couple hundred basis points of overall growth in the quarter that really aren't expected to be there throughout the year. 
And then seasonally, in Q4, some of the transaction-based revenues around the portals tend to be a little lighter as well. So I think those are the biggest factors. But certainly, we have an opportunity to continue to broaden our subscription revenues as we move through the year. But I keep those seasonality factors in mind."

Leading up 2018, 2019, the economy was really good. The budgets were really strong. There was an anticipation of negative COVID impact that prediction really didn't come through. And since then, as you mentioned, we've lumped on a lot of stimulus money. In addition to that, and I think I mentioned on the last call, perhaps we all see what's going on out there in the real estate market and the boom that's going on there, which is driving appraisals and valuations up, which further than drives up assessments and property taxes, which is a big funder of a lot of our -- particularly with our local government clients.

We've seen the pipeline already just this year grow significantly in that space.

I think it was an interesting quarter from a new business perspective because even though SaaS, as a percentage of the new deal volume increased pretty significantly over last year from 66% to 80%.

So we saw a little bit of both. 
On a broad basis, our expectation for the year is around 80 to the low 80s percentage of our new contract volume coming in, in SaaS. So we're generally on line with that, but we would expect that we continue to see an ongoing shift towards that preference for new customers to come through the cloud. 
And as we talked about at year-end, part of that is -- reflects the change in our approach to sales and including a number of significant products that are now only available through the cloud that are no longer being offered in a license model in new proposals.

I'm a little hesitant to outline some of that right now because we haven't even notified all of our customers yet of our future strategy. Our clients generally know that we are going cloud first. That's not a surprise to anyone. But in terms of specific time lines, I'd rather sort of keep that messaging within us right now until we're ready to do that.

But generally, as we move through this year, probably in line with that historical number. Very seasonal in terms of being weighted towards the third quarter. A lot of that has to do with the vast majority of our maintenance renewals, which are around $470 million a year of maintenance revenues. The vast majority of those renew as of July 1. And so we typically bill those in Q2 and collect them in Q3. So that drives really strong growth in our cash flow in our cash flow in Q3. 
And other than that transaction revenues, we've talked about some seasonality around those being a little lighter in Q4. But as we continue to expand the subscription business, that tends to smooth out the cash flow. So Q3 -- Q1 is typically the lightest. Q3 is very much the strongest, but I think the margins, you can expect to be fairly consistent."

When we talk about -- we don't give quarterly guidance, but when we talk about the full year, I think licenses will likely see a mid-single-digit decline. Services are likely to be around the mid-teens kind of growth. Subscriptions, expect to remain really solid growth in the 25% to 30% range for the year. Maintenance, as I said, flat to down low single digits. Appraisal is seeing a nice resurgence in activity after some slowdowns during COVID and expect to see high teens growth there. And hardware is a much smaller piece of our business. But with Connect coming back in person this year, those revenues fall there. So we expect to see kind of mid-30% growth on a relatively small base of revenues in hardware and other."

We're continuing to do everything else we've always done, which is be opportunistic, look at our internal R&D. We continue to look at acquisitions. With the softness in the market, we'll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities versus the paying down the debt. But I'd say right now, that's our priority. 
Just as a reminder, as Brian mentioned, we paid down $415 million of the debt. And of our outstanding debt, about $600 million is sitting in a convertible, which right now is about 45%, and that's at a fixed rate 25 basis points that's not maturing until '26.

My comments are really about the fact that the extension of what we can do with Tyler, we've talked about being able to be in the local markets in Florida. Our ability because of our robust payment engine to be able to do things that certain other payment providers can't do that are in our focus on the government space drives that as you look out towards other states and other localities. 
But payments is one of our big future growth drivers. It's something that all of our divisions are focusing on. And I think it's something that you're going to see drive growth over time.

So yes, on the base, we typically get that, at least low single-digit annual increase. We, as you know, have very, very low attrition in terms of customers leaving us. In terms of dollars, probably around 1%. And then certainly, as fewer new customers come to us in a license model with maintenance that there's smaller and smaller number of new adds, but we have that 20% of our new business that is coming in license does generate new maintenance. 
And then the bigger impact that is likely to accelerate over the coming years is the flips or the migrations of those on-premise customers that are currently paying us maintenance moving into the cloud and shifting to subscription. So it's a change in what revenue line they come on, but does typically, rough numbers, double what they're paying us over maintenance.

Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first",663,"Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first quarter, with core revenue growth of 13%, excluding COVID-related revenues. NIC's growth was boosted by revenues under the new statewide payments contract in Florida and in particular, by revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State that are concentrated in the first quarter. NIC's COVID-related revenues were in line with our expectations at $20.6 million. 
Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 140% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew a robust 33.8%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 57 of the last 65 quarters. 
We're particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth even as we saw an acceleration of the shift in our new software contract mix from licenses to SaaS. In Q1, 80% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 66% in Q1 last year. 
As we outlined on our last earnings call, while our move to the cloud builds long-term value, margins compressed in Q1, reflecting the new business mix shift, the inclusion of NIC and in particular, their COVID-related revenues, as well as expenses related to the cloud transition. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 24.3%, but increased 70 basis points sequentially from Q4 of 2021. 
We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the first quarter, NIC successfully extended our enterprise contract in Alabama. And in April, we extended our enterprise agreement with New Jersey. NIC also signed a new 5-year SaaS deal with the State of Mississippi to provide our NIC cannabis licensing platform valued at approximately $4.3 million. 
We continue to experience success with sell-through deals of Tyler products through NIC's state relationships. In Q1, those deals included sales of our data and insights platform to the State of Vermont and our entellitrak platform for Veterans Affairs in Alabama. We also signed agreements for NIC's payments platform with existing Tyler clients in Hillsboro County, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Glendale, California. 
Our largest new deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement with the San Diego Association of Governments for Enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, along with our data and insight solution valued at approximately $4.9 million. We also signed 5 notable SaaS deals, each with a total contract value greater than $2 million, with Glen County, Georgia for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by iasWorld Solution; the cities of Rialto, California, and Alamogordo, New Mexico, for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis; and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov; and the cities of Mansfield and Burleson in Texas for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution. 
Our largest license deal in Q1 was a $2.7 million agreement with the Utah Department of Public Safety, our first public safety deployment in the state of Utah. The deal includes enterprise law enforcement records, mobile, field mobile, enforcement mobile, and public safety analytics. We also signed four other notable license arrangements in the quarter, each with a total contract value greater than $1 million with the St. Johns County Property Appraiser in Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by iasWorld; the city of Elmhurst, Illinois, for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution; St. Mary's County government in Maryland for our enterprise public safety, powered by New World and Data & Insights Solutions; and the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, for our enforcement mobile powered by Brazos solution. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $456.1 million, up 54.7%, with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth was the highest since Q4 of 2016 at 12.8%. Software licenses and services grew 24.7% or 3.7%, excluding NIC. 
Subscription revenues rose 139.5% with very strong organic growth of 33.8%. We added 149 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 88 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $76 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and had 39 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $16.2 million in new ARR. 
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 66% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.0 years last year. 
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing, and e-filing revenues, and are included in subscriptions, were $152.9 million, up 461%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 9.8%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.2 million, up 16.9%. 
For the first quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.45 billion, up 63.6%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $378.1 million, up 25.1%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $603.7 million, up 461%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $468.1 million, due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.76 billion, up 13.8%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $26.3 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.1%. 
Bookings in the quarter were strong at approximately $419 million, up 70.1%, including the transaction-based revenues at NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $283 million, up 14.7%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 65%, and on an organic basis were approximately $1.4 billion, up 21.7%. If our weighted average contract term for new SaaS contracts has been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 17.1%. 
Cash from operations declined this quarter by 25.3% to $53.5 million, mainly due to changes in working capital related to higher payments of accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments related to stock-based compensation. Free cash flow declined by 33.5% to $41 million due to the decrease in cash from operations and somewhat higher capital spending this quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $20 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $415 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.32 billion and cash and investments of $322.6 million and net leverage of approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. 
As Lynn mentioned earlier, we're off to a great start in 2022, resulting in an improvement in our outlook for the full year. As a result, we have raised our 2022 annual revenue and earnings guidance as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $40 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are currently expected to continue through the second quarter of 2022, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue through the third quarter. 
We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.92 and $4.08 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.48 and $7.64. 
Based on updated assumptions regarding additional interest rate hikes this year, we have increased our estimated interest expense for the year by $3.4 million to $23 million, with an impact on non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.06 a share. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. 
Finally, before I turn the call back to Lynn, I'd like to announce that Hala Elsherbini will be joining Tyler as Senior Director of Investor Relations, effective May 9. Many of you have worked with Hala in the past, and we're very excited to have an IR professional with Hala's experience and knowledge of Tyler join our team. Lynn?"

I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the full year. Activity in our public sector market continues to trend positively, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. 
We remain on track with our strategic initiatives, including our development projects to optimize our products for more efficient deployment in the cloud and our cloud-first approach to sales, which we believe will create significant long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow remain very strong and we continue to be opportunistic with regard to capital allocation. We're excited about the acquisition of US eDirect in February, which significantly expands our outdoor recreation portfolio, allowing us to offer an extensive all-in-one outdoor recreation solution that will seamlessly integrate with our NIC payments platform. 
While we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, we are heavily focused on integration and execution around the acquisitions we've completed over the last 2 years, making the bar on new acquisitions at this time relatively high. 
Last Thursday marked the 1-year anniversary of our landmark acquisition of NIC. As I reflect on the acquisition and all that we have accomplished as a combined entity over the last 12 months, I can truly say that it has exceeded our expectations, which were already high. 
Our teams have come together as one unified organization and our collective excitement about the opportunities that the combination unlocks has continued to grow. We've integrated our payments teams and have refined our strategy to pursue what we believe is a huge TAM in government payments. 
As we've discussed, we're winning new business with sell-throughs into our respective client bases. In this quarter, we doubled the number of sell-through opportunities in our pipeline. We look forward to continuing to report on our progress in the second year of our combination. 
The challenges of today's labor market continue to be an area of significant focus for us. While we added 195 new team members in the first quarter, we currently have a higher-than-normal number of open positions. Although our open positions have a short-term positive impact on margins, we have aggressive hiring plans for the balance of the year to support our growth. 
Finally, we're extremely excited to host clients live and in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in Indianapolis from May 15 through May 18. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

There's, I think, two things around that. 
One, as we pointed out, the Florida contract for statewide payments with NIC, which is a new contract, is ramping up, but there were some revenues in Q1 that are specific to Q1 around filings -- revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State in Florida. And that added, I think, roughly close to $6.5 million of revenue in subscriptions in Q1. And so actually accounted for a couple hundred basis points of overall growth in the quarter that really aren't expected to be there throughout the year. 
And then seasonally, in Q4, some of the transaction-based revenues around the portals tend to be a little lighter as well. So I think those are the biggest factors. But certainly, we have an opportunity to continue to broaden our subscription revenues as we move through the year. But I keep those seasonality factors in mind."

So we believe it's a potential tailwind through the next 2 or 3 years. 
But I'd say right now, if there's an impact there, it's probably fairly modest. It's not 5 points to growth. But it's certainly part of that very active market we're seeing."

So it sort of combines that into creating, as we said, sort of an all-in-one opportunity. 
We've seen the pipeline already just this year grow significantly in that space. And I think one of the things that we're excited about is not just combining the NIC technology with US eDirect, which is also, by the way, deployed in AWS, but our ability to go out and sell it. So it's a solution. When you talk about outdoor reservations and stuff, it's not just going in the states, which will be through NIC sales channels, but we also have the ability to go sell it more locally through some of Tyler's sales channels."

So we saw a little bit of both. 
On a broad basis, our expectation for the year is around 80 to the low 80s percentage of our new contract volume coming in, in SaaS. So we're generally on line with that, but we would expect that we continue to see an ongoing shift towards that preference for new customers to come through the cloud. 
And as we talked about year-end, part of that reflects the change in our approach to sales, including a number of significant products that are now only available through the cloud, that are no longer being offered in a license model in new proposals.

I'm a little hesitant to outline some of that right now, because we haven't even notified all of our customers yet of our future strategy. Our clients generally know that we are going cloud first. That's not a surprise to anyone. But in terms of specific time lines, I'd rather sort of keep that messaging within us right now until we're ready to do that.

I generally expect that our free cash flow margins -- there's a lot of puts and takes there, but generally, as we move through this year, probably in line with that historical number. Very seasonal in terms of being weighted towards the third quarter. A lot of that has to do with the vast majority of our maintenance renewals, which are around $470 million a year of maintenance revenues. The vast majority of those renew as of July 1. And so we typically bill those in Q2 and collect them in Q3. So that drives really strong growth in our cash flow in Q3. 
And other than that, transaction revenues, we've talked about some seasonality around those being a little lighter in Q4. But as we continue to expand the subscription business, that tends to smooth out the cash flow. So Q1 is typically the lightest. Q3 is very much the strongest, but I think the margins, you can expect to be fairly consistent."

But I think those broad ranges of growth that we talked about on the year-end call are still generally true. 
When we talk about -- we don't give quarterly guidance, but when we talk about the full year, I think licenses will likely see a mid-single-digit decline. Services are likely to be around the mid-teens kind of growth. Subscriptions, expect to remain really solid growth in the 25% to 30% range for the year. Maintenance, as I said, flat to down low single digits. Appraisal is seeing a nice resurgence in activity after some slowdowns during COVID and expect to see high-teens growth there. And hardware is a much smaller piece of our business. But with Connect coming back in person this year, those revenues fall there.

There's a lot of opportunity that we're seeing there. 
We're also -- I think we sort of referenced it, our e-filing is back to prepandemic levels, which is good to see. And Public Safety continues to do the things that we expected to do with all of these investments. They signed another large deal. Their competitive position is strong. They've done a good job with their clients on some of these new products, getting them live, getting them settled, getting referenceable. So across the board, it's pretty good across the board, maybe it's a few places a little bit better than others, but generally speaking, I'd say it's pretty healthy."

But the impact on margins and revenue from sort of the runoff of the licenses and as that business continues to shift towards a higher percentage coming into SaaS. 
And we said, really, by the end of -- both of those have impacts over the next couple of years. But we think that sort of that inflection point where licenses or the runoff of the remaining licenses or the shift of those into SaaS model no longer has a negative impact on margins because we have built up that run rate of subscription revenues, and we really believe that 2023 is sort of the trough on margins. And part of that is the lessening of the impact of the mix shift. 
So what we're seeing this year is pretty much in line with how we looked at the estimated mix going in. But we do expect that percentage at 80% to continue to grow."

So there's a lot there, Keith, to talk about. We mentioned, I think, in our last earnings call that part of our OP pressure this year was the fact that we were generally increasing our budget for employee compensation a little higher than we had traditionally. 
The labor market challenges are out there. Our turnover is higher than historic. But from what we see and the studies that we look at, we still believe it's lower than most in the tech industry. 
The competition is tough out there right now. I sometimes look at it, however, in terms of -- when I think about external factors, be it inflation or recession concerns or the labor market is, what do we do within Tyler? How does it impact us versus our competitors? And people like to come to work here. We've got a good culture. I like to think that. Some of these things may disproportionately affect some of our maybe perhaps smaller competitors as it relates to inflation and pricing. 
As you know, most of our agreements are annual agreements or multiyear agreements with some of the ability with escalators. We have the ability to adjust those -- adjust pricing on our services that we send out there. So I think we're in a position where we can attack inflationary pressures. Our people are working hard to staff and hire. We've done a lot of business in the last year and we need to go execute on some of it.

My comments are really about the fact that the extension of what we can do with Tyler, we've talked about being able to go in the local markets in Florida. Our ability, because of our robust payment engine, to be able to do things that certain other payment providers can't do that are in our focus on the government space drives that as you look out towards other states and other localities. 
But payments is one of our big future growth drivers. It's something that all of our divisions are focusing on. And I think it's something that you're going to see drive growth over time. It's going to -- like a lot of our long-term growth drivers, it will ramp up over time. And if you say, where are we out 5 years from now, we think the market is pretty big.

And historically, I'd say, across most of our customers, we're typically in the 4% to 5% annual increase on a pretty consistent basis over a number of years, and that hasn't changed. 
So yes, on the base, we typically get that, at least low single-digit annual increase. We, as you know, have very, very low attrition in terms of customers leaving us. In terms of dollars, probably around 1%. And then certainly, as fewer new customers come to us in a license model with maintenance that there's smaller and smaller number of new adds, but we have that 20% of our new business that is coming in license does generate new maintenance. 
And then the bigger impact that is likely to accelerate over the coming years is the flips or the migrations of those on-premise customers that are currently paying us maintenance moving into the cloud and shifting to subscription. So it's a change in what revenue line they come on, but does typically, rough numbers, double what they're paying us over maintenance.

We're pleased with our second quarter results as the public sector market environment remains strong and RFP and demo activities continue to trend positively. We leveraged successful multi-suite wins and cross-selling efforts to deliver a solid quarter, and our strong competitive position, coupled with an active public sector market, drove a 21% increase in bookings. Overall, we see the challenging broader macro environment as an opportunity to support our clients by replacing aging mission-critical systems and adding advanced digital services to serve the public more efficiently.
Total revenues grew approximately 16% with organic growth of 6.2%. Services revenues were flat on an organic basis, exhibiting some softness due to labor market challenges affecting our hiring of implementation resources. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 28% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenues grew 14%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues.
We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 58 of the last 66 quarters. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix accelerates to SaaS from licenses. In Q2, 74% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 65% in Q2 last year.
As expected, margins compressed, reflecting the increase in our SaaS new business mix and the associated decline in license revenues as well as costs related to the cloud transition. Along with bookings performance, cash flow was a high point of the quarter as both cash flows from operations and free cash flow achieved new highs for a second quarter. April 21 marked the first anniversary of our NIC acquisition, and we continue to be excited about their performance and the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for both Tyler and NIC. NIC's core organic revenue growth was 8%.
During the second quarter, we successfully extended our enterprise contracts in West Virginia, Vermont, Kansas and Kentucky. NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new 4-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year.
In addition, NIC signed a new SaaS agreement for our cannabis solution with the states of Alabama and Illinois, which are both state enterprise clients. We continue to build momentum with our joint and cross-sell opportunities with NIC. Our active cross-sell pipeline doubled in value from Q1, and we closed 3 new deals with NIC clients, including the state of Utah for our Entellitrak Veterans Benefit System and the state of Kentucky for our VendEngine Resident Resources Solution.
In other Tyler divisions, we signed 4 additional notable SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $3.8 million. Those include Maricopa County, Arizona, for our enterprise permitting and licensing solution; Lancaster, California for our enterprise ERP solution; Lima, Ohio for our enterprise justice and supervision solutions as well as our full suite of public safety applications; and Orange County, Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax solution. In addition, we signed 6 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $2 million and $3 million each and 14 SaaS deals with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each.
During the second quarter, we also amended our e-filing agreement with the state of Washington from a transaction-based volume arrangement to a fixed fee contract. The deal spans 9 years for approximately $27 million. However, due to certain contract terms, the majority of this contract was not included in backlog or bookings this quarter. The deal adds approximately $2.8 million in ARR, expanding to over $3 million in ARR in the latter half of the agreement.
Our largest new software contract in the quarter was a license deal with Montreal, Quebec for our enterprise assessment and tax solution valued at approximately $13 million. We also signed a second deal in Canada for the same solution with the Yukon territory worth approximately $2 million. In addition, we signed a significant license deal with Dallas County, Texas for our enterprise correction solution valued at approximately $4.5 million. Dallas County, which currently uses our enterprise case management solution, has the ninth largest jail system in the U.S., making it our largest jail client.
Other significant license arrangements signed in the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million include Charlotte County, Florida and Huntington Park, California for enterprise ERP solution; Fort Worth, Texas for our enforcement mobile solution; and Owasso, Oklahoma for our enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data and insight solutions.
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $468.7 million, up 16%, including NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was 6.2% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter exceeded our expectations at $15.2 million. Revenues from the TourHealth initiatives concluded in the second quarter and the Virginia rent relief program is expected to be completed in the third quarter with about $8 million of revenues anticipated in the quarter.
As expected, license revenues declined 14.7% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS. Software revenues rose 18.3% -- service revenues rose 18.3% but on an organic basis were essentially flat with last year. Services revenues were impacted by delays in hiring new professional services staff in the current labor market. While we hired a large class of implementers during the quarter, there is an onboarding period of several months before they will be fully billable. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the second half of the year to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on services revenues in the short term as those teams ramp up.
Subscription revenues rose 28.2% with strong organic growth of 14.1%. We added 167 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 96 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $115 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and had 62 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value.
Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $27.6 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 65% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 4.1 years last year.
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $154.4 million, up 29.1%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 17.5%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.5 million, up 14%. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, up 16.3%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $405.6 million, up 24.9%.  Transaction-based ARR was approximately $617.7 million, up 29.1% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down 2.3% at approximately $467.3 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.85 billion, up 13.9%. Bookings in the quarter were very strong at approximately $562 million, up 21%, including transaction-based revenues. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $423 million, up 16.3%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $2 billion, up 53.2% on an organic basis were approximately $1.5 billion up 21.1%. If our weighted average contract terms for new SaaS contracts had been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 18.3%. As Lynn mentioned earlier, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for a second quarter. Cash flows from operations were $76.7 million and free cash flow rose to $60 million from negative $33.5 million last year. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet.
During the quarter, we repaid $60 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $475 million of term debt. We will also pay down an additional $100 million in term debt at the end of this month. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion and cash and investments of $314 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with an interest rate of 0.25% and the remainder is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at June 30 was approximately 2.07x trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA and our leverage should be under 2x at the end of July.
Interest rate hikes thus far this year and projected for the remainder of the year have resulted in significantly higher projected interest expense for the year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In addition, we have debt discounts and issuance costs related to our term debt that are being amortized as noncash interest expense. And as we prepay term debt, we are required to accelerate the amortization of those costs.
Accordingly, we have adjusted our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect those changes in assumptions around interest. Our current guidance for the full year interest expense of $30 million represents an increase of about $7 million or approximately $0.12 per share for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS compared to our previous guidance. The $7 million increase includes about $4 million of cash interest on term debt and $3 million of additional noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. It's important to note that our revenue guidance has not changed, and our expectations for operating margins are generally consistent with our previous outlook.
Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.870 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $44 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenues from TourHealth concluded in the second quarter, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to wind down in the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.60 and $3.76 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.36 and $7.52.
Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $7.5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

Against the backdrop of generally strong public sector budgets supplemented by federal stimulus funds, we're experiencing a very active market. With our leading competitive position and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. The acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months, including NIC, VendEngine and US eDirect, are performing well and contributing to our strong competitive position, helping us create more cross-sell and upsell opportunities with both new and existing clients.
In particular, our enthusiasm around the cross-sell opportunities through NIC continues to grow, with recent wins across multiple Tyler products and a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. We're also pleased with our progress around our combined payments business. as we begin to execute our go-to-market strategy to pursue a tremendous public sector payments TAM.
We believe Tyler is uniquely qualified to deliver government-focused payment solutions, leveraging the strength of NIC's payment platform, analytics and reporting and deep domain expertise together with Tyler's broad software portfolio and extensive client base, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming quarters.
Even as we face an uncertain economic macro environment with rising inflation and interest rates, we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid financial results and to grow cash flow. There are a number of factors that make Tyler's business resilient and relatively defensive compared to many software peers. The public sector market is more stable than many segments of the private sector. We provide solutions that power essential government services often replacing mission-critical systems that are end of life, and our clients don't go out of business or get acquired.
Recurring revenues comprised approximately 80% and growing of our total revenues, generating highly reliable cash flow. In addition, the public sector is increasingly focused on moving into the cloud, which we support with our cloud-first model. Our experience during the recession more than a decade ago supports our confidence and Tyler is clearly in a much stronger position today to succeed during an economic downturn.
We also have the advantage of a very strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest strategically in growth even if some competitors may be constrained. While we have term and convertible debt associated with the NIC acquisition and have been impacted by rising interest rates, we are modestly leveraged at approximately 2x adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to continue to delever.
Accordingly, in the near term, we are prioritizing using our cash flow to reduce debt while retaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that provide long-term value.
Finally, I'm happy to report that we remain on track with our major strategic initiatives, including projects related to optimizing our products for efficient deployment of the cloud, moving from our proprietary data centers to AWS, and ultimately accelerating the migration of our on-premise clients to the cloud and driving long-term margin expansion.
With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

What was the sales cycle for these? Are sales cycles tightening, elongating? Are they in line with prior length? Any color on that?
And then the second kind of question tied to that is we are seeing a strengthening state and local budget spend environment. And I think one question we do get from a lot of investors is how do you connect those revisions in those state and local budgets? And how do those end up making their way into companies, right, like yourselves? Could you kind of give us an idea from what you guys see in the field from the date budgets are announced to the date that they're actually translated into actual bookings or revenues on your side?"

I'll start and I'll let Brian jump in. I think right now, our sales cycles are pretty normal. I think we've experienced times if you go back to the recession in '08, '09, that's where you started seeing things push out and get delayed. We saw a little bit of that during COVID. But I think the key is we continually talk about the fact that what we provide is essential functionality and the software that we do provide are things that are needed and they're often replacing out of date or systems. And so right now, the market looks good. The sales cycles are pretty typical for a normal healthy time, even with respect to those large deals.
Sales cycles will vary a little bit across our different divisions. Some have longer than others. And sometimes the larger deals do take a little bit longer. But I think across the board, across our different product suites, I'd say sales cycles are pretty much on track. When you talk about state and local government spending environment, what we're seeing right now really is it's pretty healthy. I agree their budgets are in good shape. I've made comments before that I think coming out of COVID, they were not hit nearly as hard as a lot of people anticipated some of the journal reports and other things that we've read. Also with the infusion of some stimulus. And I know Brian's got some numbers and thoughts around ARPA.
But I think right now, what we're seeing in our pipeline, all our leading indicators around RFPs and demos, things like that, you're seeing it a little bit in some of our bookings this quarter is that things are well right now in the state and local government."

Clearly, on the larger contracts, typically do have a longer sales cycle and some of these very large ones, sales cycles can be sometimes measured in years from the time we start talking to someone about a solution and the timing of when those actually show up in a signed contract can be somewhat unpredictable. And I'd say that's the case with a couple of these larger deals, the Montreal deal and the Dallas deal that we talked about, both had pretty long cycles, but we're pretty persistent.
In terms of the timing of how something makes it into the bookings, that can also vary quite a bit. Some jurisdictions will start the process of acquiring a solution before they have it budgeted, knowing that it's a mission-critical solution and replacing it is somewhat nondiscretionary. So they may start the sales process or the buying process well in advance of that actually showing up in a budget and be prepared then when it's funded to sign a contract and move forward pretty quickly. Others may get it in a budget and then start a process or really accelerate a process. So it can take place in a variety of ways, but -- so the fact that new budgets are rising doesn't immediately result in sort of a flood of new pipeline activity that don't always perfectly match up."

And I guess I would just say that the labor market challenges that are out there, we talk about a lot of things in our business where we may be a little bit immune to some of the external macro factors. But the challenges in the labor market, we're not unique there. And so we've been experiencing this for some time. It has been a challenge, both in terms of hiring and recruiting, and we're also seeing it with a little bit higher early retirements and things like that.
The impact is -- we're seeing it right now, and we've got a lot of business we want to execute on and deliver on, but our services revenues are off a little bit. And I'd probably expect some of that to carry through throughout the year. We do generally make sort of large hiring classes. You take, for example, our enterprise ERP group. They hired a very large class back in February. I think we're looking at hiring another very large class in the next few weeks. But even when you hire those large classes, it takes time for them to get up to speed and get to a point where they can go out and become fully billable on client implementation. So it can take 4, 5, 6 months. So there's a little bit of delay there. So there's a little bit of impact that will happen even as our margins as we bring these people on, but it takes a little time for them to start becoming billable.
As it relates to external partners, I think historically, we've always wanted to keep our services in-house. It's certainly not a big margin advantage to have them in-house, but we think from a professional and competitive and client ownership advantage, it really has been -- has played out and been a lot of value to us really for the last 25 years. The thought of always having the touch point from initially from our sales, handing it off to our implementation team, handing it off to our support team. I think that client relationship and client experience is part of what drives our success in the market. And so as of right now, we're not really looking to do that. It's such a unique business that I think we just want to keep these things in-house, at least for the time being."

That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff."

In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or 2 after",552,"Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or 2 after the signing before their environment stood up and we start to recognize revenues. So even with the SaaS customer, there's a lag. And then, of course, you've got a recurring revenue stream that you're starting to grow. So it may start in the third month of the quarter and so you get a month's worth of revenues, and the next quarter you get a quarter's worth and so forth. And so that ongoing change in the mix has been a part of that with less licenses, which are typically recognized mostly upfront.
We talked about a little bit of the service pressure as well. So that also is with our -- a little bit below plan headcount there, we're, I think, not ramping up those new signings as quickly as we might once we're sort of fully staffed with our billable implementation teams. So I think that's the biggest thing.
I think in terms of just driving higher bookings, we've always said bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially around those big deals. In this quarter, a couple of those big deals that did have long sales cycles got to contract. But generally, I'd say it's sort of a combination of those factors we pointed out, pretty strong economic backdrop in budget situation around governments. It's certainly aided by the ARPA funds, the federal stimulus that's available to them. As we've talked about on prior calls, sometimes it's not clearly identifiable that a deal was funded with ARPA funds. Sometimes it is, and there are some of those in this quarter. Other times ARPA funds are used for something else, but it frees up money that helps perhaps make an incremental purchase or an add-on sales.
We're seeing real strength in our inside sales selling additional products to existing customers, and we believe some of that is driven by the federal stimulus. But as we've said in the past, that's sort of a long-term tailwind they've got until the end of 2024 really to commit those funds and through 2026 to spend those. And we saw a study by Brookings that indicated that at least as of the end of 2021, only about 40% of the stimulus funds had been committed yet by cities and counties. So we think there's sort of an ongoing tailwind there.
So strength in the market and then our competitive position is really strong. I mean, we continue to invest at a high level. We've got multiple products that we've added through acquisitions and internal builds. So our average sales are often bigger than they would have been in the past because we've got more products that are bundled together, things like our data and insight solution that's often bundled in a new sale, a number of our public safety products that now are often in a new sale that make that bigger. So there are a number of factors contributing to that. But yes, there is typically a lag from bookings growth to revenue growth."

So we give a lot of metrics and we recognize you probably give too many metrics. But I'd say, if you're looking for kind of the North Star and what's really important is our model evolves, it would be those metrics around ARR and particularly, we do get the breakdown of those different components of ARR, but particularly software subscription ARR and transaction ARR. And we expect that maintenance will kind of flat right now, will start to decline as more of those customers flip to the cloud. So really, the things that probably the most important metric would be around those recurring ARs from subscriptions and transactions."

And you're right. I think one of our help it takes decades to develop. And so when you look at cross-selling and upselling back into that base, that's also a big strategic driver for us going forward.

And then as they become billable and they're starting to generate revenues, and help us deliver that backlog, then you see a positive impact. Services aren't a high-margin business for us as it is. But -- so I would expect that as you get into the early part of next year through the middle of next year, you'll start to see a positive impact from those employees being productive. And we hired, as Linda, a pretty big class or classes cumulatively pretty large across Q2 and have pretty strong hiring plans in the second half of the year.

Some of those are in cost of sales, particularly billable travel. So while we still currently and expect in the future to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as we did during COVID, there is billable travel returning across some segments of our business. And so that's having an impact from margins, which we expected. And then we've talked about some of the transaction cost, the bubble costs associated with our cloud transition and specifically with the move from our proprietary data centers to AWS.
And so those things are generally in line with what we expected. We did have also a bit higher revenue stream from the COVID-related revenues at NIC. Those have typically a bit lower margin than Tyler's overall margin. So the sort of overperformance in those revenues had a negative margin impact. And as we've said, we expect those to -- the last of those to go away at the end in the third quarter. So that will be a positive from a margin perspective."

We'll see how it plays out through the balance of the year. It could create some softness on that services side. But I think at this point, it's not a big impediment to growth in the subscription revenues, but certainly is some sort of a factor there."

So -- and you're right, most of our maintenance contracts are annual agreements. We do have a few multiyear ones. A small percentage of those have built-in escalators, but generally, most of them have the ability to adjust pricing on an annual basis. Some of those are tied to CPI, but I think that's probably not the majority. But there is some flexibility there. And we took a look at that this spring. Still a majority of our maintenance contracts are on the sort of the June 30, July 1 cycle, and it's something that we talked about internally back in March and April before we went out. As it relates to SaaS contracts, similar things.
I mean we -- these are -- after you get through the initial engagement, you do have the ability to start putting in price increases. A lot of our initial SaaS deals are multiyear terms. Some of them are they may be built-in escalators, but the way the revenue recognition has worked historically is that we actually have been recognizing them on more of a flat rate. So there can be a little bit of a declining margin. It's one of the reasons why we've tried really hard to shorten the length of those initial contracts, but we're also looking at doing some things with contract terms so that we will be able to get those built-in escalators. We do price them in.
So we're getting the cash in those agreements. And then as they roll off and we move into their annual renewals, we'll have the ability to change that pricing even more. But there are obviously some existing agreements that are out there that had pricing that was built in a year or 2 ago that we're -- we can't adjust at this point."

Yes, the cash flow does -- typically the third quarter, and I think that's every year is the strongest quarter, primarily because of those maintenance billings. We have close to $470 million a year in maintenance. Not all of it, but the biggest chunk of that is renewed as of July 1. They typically build late in the second quarter and collected in the third quarter. Those they are typically don't age. So those are paid relatively promptly. So that drives that third quarter cash flow growth. I think some of -- there was a little bit of an anomaly last year in the second quarter around NIC shortly with -- because they were only in for part of the quarter. And there was some sort of unusual dynamics around the timing just when we acquired them, they happen to have a fair amount of, I guess, what I'd describe as customer cash that's sort of passing through that from their transaction-based revenue streams that was on their balance sheet that then was paid out, remitted on to the customers after acquisition.
So it created sort of an anomaly there. This year, it's sort of the normal full quarter and NIC's cash flow is more consistent across the year given the transaction-based nature of most of their revenues. So I think you'll see that start to even out a little bit more. But I still think, yes, you probably see certainly more than half and more in the kind of 2/3 of our cash flow for the year in the second half of the year. But I think there was that sort of unusual situation last year."

But we're still actively looking at acquisitions. We're not -- it's not like we've closed the door. We're not answering calls. We've been actively looking. We've participated in a couple of processes this year. Obviously, we purchased USD Direct early in the year. But we need something compelling and something that's really at a reasonable valuation. What we've seen in the acquisition front, at least even recently, even as the broader markets have gone through a little bit of turbulence in the last few months. The expectations for some of these private companies has not changed. And in fact, in some cases, has almost exceeded. 
I mean if people pitch deals where they tell me that I need to be paying higher valuations than Tyler. And that's a little bit hard for me to understand. It's a bit of a head scratcher. Our debt right now is our blended rate is about -- after we make this payment this month. It will be about 2%. But that's really a function of the fact that we've paid so much debt down. when we first took out our debt, I think our convertible was about 34% of our total debt. After this payment this month. It will be more just over 50%. So as we continue to pay our term down, we won't be as impacted by interest rates as we look out over the next year, which is nice. 
As it relates to share repurchases, I think right now, I agree with you as I look out 5 years, 7 years from now, the stock could look pretty attractive. But I think unless we're really wanting to do a significant move, I'd rather just pay down the debt in the near term."

I think it's 8 of the 10 largest counties in the country something like 17 state-wide implementation. So it's a very strong product for us. But it also can be somewhat of a lumpy business, particularly with respect to those really big contracts because it is not unusual for us to see 20, think we've replaced a couple of 40-plus year old case management systems that were custom written in the 70s in some of these large counties.
And so there's sort of some long-term activity in the backdrop. We see more of the kind of mid-range deals that are more currently active in the pipeline, but I don't think there are any big statewide deals that are sort of currently actively in the market. But we do have a very high success rate as those come along. And then as we've been able to build on that really very strong position we have in the case management space, where most of our growth in courts is coming from now is from those products that we have in that suite around it.
So we mentioned on the call today, 1 of our bigger deals, Dallas County. Dallas County has been a long time. It's a top 10 county been a longtime case management customer -- but now we were able to add our jail solution to the products that they use. So building on that relationship, and we've done a number of acquisitions in that space, probation, jury, prosecutor, process service solutions that broaden our offerings there and enable us to grow there.

But I'd say that's kind of the baseline and that as we continue to drive more cross-selling and so more opportunities particularly in the payment space. And through things like the USC Direct acquisition, which is now a part of NIC, that there's certainly an opportunity to move up into the even into the low double-digit range.

I think as you go over time, we don't really report on specific organic growth within our business units. And you'll see some of that just the opportunities are there. And as payments grows, some of that payments business may go to our ERP because it's going to their client base, but I see played a significant hand just like the vend engine deal in Arkansas, Kentucky, that revenue really doesn't happen without NIC yet it's sitting on the books over in our Courts & Justice division.
So I think as we go forward, you'll probably see us less comment on their specific revenues and growth as they just become more integrated with NIC. We've kind of thought it was appropriate, really for the first year or so, but it will be like the rest of our other divisions because there's so much as we talked about, a lot of our opportunities are through cross-sells and how we leverage each other.

Overall, we see the challenging broader macro environment as an opportunity to support our clients by replacing aging mission-critical systems and adding advanced digital services to serve the public more efficiently.
Total revenues grew approximately 16% with organic growth of 6.2%. Services revenues were flat on an organic basis, exhibiting some softness due to labor market challenges affecting our hiring of implementation resources. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 28% growth in subscription revenues. 
On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenues grew 14%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues.
We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 58 of the last 66 quarters. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix accelerates to SaaS from licenses. In Q2, 74% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 65% in Q2 last year.
As expected, margins compressed, reflecting the increase in our SaaS new business mix and the associated decline in license revenues as well as costs related to the cloud transition. Along with bookings performance, cash flow was a high point of the quarter as both cash flows from operations and free cash flow achieved new highs for a second quarter. 
April 21 marked the first anniversary of our NIC acquisition, and we continue to be excited about their performance and the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for both Tyler and NIC. NIC's core organic revenue growth was 8%.
During the second quarter, we successfully extended our enterprise contracts in West Virginia, Vermont, Kansas and Kentucky. NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new 4-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year.
In addition, NIC signed a new SaaS agreement for our cannabis solution with the states of Alabama and Illinois, which are both state enterprise clients. We continue to build momentum with our joint and cross-sell opportunities with NIC. Our active cross-sell pipeline doubled in value from Q1, and we closed 3 new deals with NIC clients, including the state of Utah for our Entellitrak Veterans' Benefit System and the state of Kentucky for our VendEngine Resident Resources Solution.
In other Tyler divisions, we signed 4 additional notable SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $3.8 million. Those include Maricopa County, Arizona, for our enterprise permitting and licensing solution; Lancaster, California for our enterprise ERP solution; Lima, Ohio for our enterprise justice and supervision solutions as well as our full suite of public safety applications; and Orange County, Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax solution. 
In addition, we signed 6 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $2 million and $3 million each and 14 SaaS deals with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each.
During the second quarter, we also amended our e-filing agreement with the state of Washington from a transaction-based volume arrangement to a fixed fee contract. The deal spans 9 years for approximately $27 million. However, due to certain contract terms, the majority of this contract was not included in backlog or bookings this quarter. The deal adds approximately $2.8 million in ARR, expanding to over $3 million in ARR in the latter half of the agreement.
Our largest new software contract in the quarter was a license deal with Montreal, Quebec for our enterprise assessment and tax solution, valued at approximately $13 million. We also signed a second deal in Canada for the same solution with the Yukon territory worth approximately $2 million. In addition, we signed a significant license deal with Dallas County, Texas for our enterprise corrections solution valued at approximately $4.5 million. Dallas County, which currently uses our enterprise case management solution, has the ninth largest jail system in the U.S., making it our largest jail client.
Other significant license arrangements signed in the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million include Charlotte County, Florida and Huntington Park, California for enterprise ERP solution; Fort Worth, Texas for our enforcement mobile solution; and Owasso, Oklahoma for our enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data and insight solutions.
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $468.7 million, up 16%, including NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues, was 6.2% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter exceeded our expectations at $15.2 million. Revenues from the TourHealth initiatives concluded in the second quarter and the Virginia rent relief program is expected to be completed in the third quarter with about $8 million of revenues anticipated in the quarter.
As expected, license revenues declined 14.7% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS. Software revenues rose 18.3% -- service revenues rose 18.3%, but on an organic basis were essentially flat with last year. Services revenues were impacted by delays in hiring new professional services staff in the current labor market. 
While we hired a large class of implementers during the quarter, there is an onboarding period of several months before they will be fully billable. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the second half of the year to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on services revenues in the short term as those teams ramp up.
Subscription revenues rose 28.2% with strong organic growth of 14.1%. We added 167 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 96 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $115 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and had 62 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value.
Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $27.6 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 65% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 4.1 years last year.
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $154.4 million, up 29.1%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 17.5%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.5 million, up 14%. 
For the second quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, up 16.3%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $405.6 million, up 24.9%.  Transaction-based ARR was approximately $617.7 million, up 29.1% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down 2.3% at approximately $467.3 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.85 billion, up 13.9%. Bookings in the quarter were very strong at approximately $562 million, up 21%, including transaction-based revenues. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $423 million, up 16.3%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $2 billion, up 53.2% and on an organic basis were approximately $1.5 billion, up 21.1%. If our weighted average contract terms for new SaaS contracts had been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 18.3%. 
As Lynn mentioned earlier, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for a second quarter. Cash flows from operations were $76.7 million and free cash flow rose to $60 million from negative $33.5 million last year. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $60 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $475 million of term debt. We will also pay down an additional $100 million in term debt at the end of this month. 
We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion and cash and investments of $314 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with an interest rate of 0.25% and the remainder is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at June 30 was approximately 2.07x trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA and our leverage should be under 2x at the end of July.
Interest rate hikes thus far this year and projected for the remainder of the year have resulted in significantly higher projected interest expense for the year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In addition, we have debt discounts and issuance costs related to our term debt that are being amortized as noncash interest expense. And as we prepay term debt, we are required to accelerate the amortization of those costs.
Accordingly, we have adjusted our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect those changes in assumptions around interest. Our current guidance for the full year interest expense of $30 million represents an increase of about $7 million or approximately $0.12 per share for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS compared to our previous guidance. The $7 million increase includes about $4 million of cash interest on term debt and $3 million of additional noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. It's important to note that our revenue guidance has not changed, and our expectations for operating margins are generally consistent with our previous outlook.
Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.870 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $44 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenues from TourHealth concluded in the second quarter, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to wind down in the third quarter. 
We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.60 and $3.76 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.36 and $7.52.
Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $7.5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

Against the backdrop of generally strong public sector budgets supplemented by federal stimulus funds, we're experiencing a very active market. With our leading competitive position and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. 
The acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months, including NIC, VendEngine and US eDirect, are performing well and contributing to our strong competitive position, helping us create more cross-sell and upsell opportunities with both new and existing clients.
In particular, our enthusiasm around the cross-sell opportunities through NIC continues to grow, with recent wins across multiple Tyler products and a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. We're also pleased with our progress around our combined payments business, as we begin to execute our go-to-market strategy to pursue a tremendous public sector payments TAM.
We believe Tyler is uniquely qualified to deliver government-focused payment solutions, leveraging the strength of NIC's payment platform, analytics and reporting and deep domain expertise together with Tyler's broad software portfolio and extensive client base, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming quarters.
Even as we face an uncertain economic macro environment with rising inflation and interest rates, we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid financial results and to grow cash flow. 
There are a number of factors that make Tyler's business resilient and relatively defensive compared to many software peers. The public sector market is more stable than many segments of the private sector. We provide solutions that power essential government services often replacing mission-critical systems that are end of life, and our clients don't go out of business or get acquired.
Recurring revenues comprised approximately 80% and growing of our total revenues, generating highly reliable cash flow. In addition, the public sector is increasingly focused on moving into the cloud, which we support with our cloud-first model. Our experience during the recession more than a decade ago supports our confidence, and Tyler is clearly in a much stronger position today to succeed during an economic downturn.
We also have the advantage of a very strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest strategically in growth even if some competitors may be constrained. While we have term and convertible debt associated with the NIC acquisition and have been impacted by rising interest rates, we are modestly leveraged at approximately 2x adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to continue to delever.
Accordingly, in the near term, we are prioritizing using our cash flow to reduce debt, while retaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that provide long-term value.
Finally, I'm happy to report that we remain on track with our major strategic initiatives, including projects related to optimizing our products for efficient deployment of the cloud, moving from our proprietary data centers to AWS, and ultimately accelerating the migration of our on-premise clients to the cloud and driving long-term margin expansion.
With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

What was the sales cycle for these? Are sales cycles tightening, elongating? Are they in line with prior length? Any color on that?
And then the second kind of question tied to that is we are seeing a strengthening state and local budget spend environment. And I think one question we do get from a lot of investors is how do you connect those revisions in those state and local budgets? And how do those end up making their way into companies, right, like yourselves? Could you kind of give us an idea from what you guys see in the field from the date budgets are announced to the date that they're actually translated into actual bookings or revenues on your side?"

I'll start and I'll let Brian jump in. I think right now, our sales cycles are pretty normal. I think we've experienced times if you go back to the recession in '08, '09, that's where you started seeing things push out and get delayed. We saw a little bit of that during COVID. But I think the key is we continually talk about the fact that what we provide is essential functionality and the software that we do provide are things that are needed and they're often replacing out of date or systems. 
And so right now, the market looks good. The sales cycles are pretty typical for a normal healthy time, even with respect to those large deals. Sales cycles will vary a little bit across our different divisions. Some have longer than others. And sometimes the larger deals do take a little bit longer. But I think across the board, across our different product suites, I'd say sales cycles are pretty much on track. 
When you talk about state and local government spending environment, what we're seeing right now really is it's pretty healthy. I agree their budgets are in good shape. I've made comments before that I think coming out of COVID, they were not hit nearly as hard as a lot of people anticipated some of the journal reports and other things that we've read. Also with the infusion of some stimulus. And I know Brian's got some numbers and thoughts around ARPA.
But I think right now, what we're seeing in our pipeline, all our leading indicators around RFPs and demos, things like that, you're seeing it a little bit in some of our bookings this quarter is that things are well right now in the state and local government."

Clearly, on the larger contracts, typically do have a longer sales cycle and some of these very large ones, sales cycles can be sometimes measured in years from the time we start talking to someone about a solution and the timing of when those actually show up in a signed contract can be somewhat unpredictable. And I'd say that's the case with a couple of these larger deals, the Montreal deal and the Dallas deal that we talked about, both had pretty long cycles, but we're pretty persistent.
In terms of the timing of how something makes it into the bookings, that can also vary quite a bit. Some jurisdictions will start the process of acquiring a solution before they have it budgeted, knowing that it's a mission-critical solution and replacing it is somewhat nondiscretionary. So they may start the sales process or the buying process well in advance of that actually showing up in a budget and be prepared then when it's funded to sign a contract and move forward pretty quickly. Others may get it in a budget and then start a process or really accelerate a process. 
So it can take place in a variety of ways, but -- so the fact that new budgets are rising doesn't immediately result in sort of a flood of new pipeline activity that don't always perfectly match up."

And I guess I would just say that the labor market challenges that are out there, we talk about a lot of things in our business where we may be a little bit immune to some of the external macro factors. But the challenges in the labor market, we're not unique there. And so we've been experiencing this for some time. It has been a challenge, both in terms of hiring and recruiting, and we're also seeing it with a little bit higher early retirements and things like that.
The impact is -- we're seeing it right now, and we've got a lot of business we want to execute on and deliver on, but our services revenues are off a little bit. And I'd probably expect some of that to carry through throughout the year. We do generally make sort of large hiring classes. You take, for example, our enterprise ERP group. They hired a very large class back in February. I think we're looking at hiring another very large class in the next few weeks. 
But even when you hire those large classes, it takes time for them to get up to speed and get to a point where they can go out and become fully billable on client implementation. So it can take 4, 5, 6 months. So there's a little bit of delay there. So there's a little bit of impact that will happen even as our margins as we bring these people on, but it takes a little time for them to start becoming billable.
As it relates to external partners, I think historically, we've always wanted to keep our services in-house. It's certainly not a big margin advantage to have them in-house, but we think from a professional and competitive and client ownership advantage, it really has been -- has played out and been a lot of value to us really for the last 25 years. The thought of always having the touch point from initially from our sales, handing it off to our implementation team, handing it off to our support team. I think that client relationship and client experience is part of what drives our success in the market. And so as of right now, we're not really looking to do that. It's such a unique business that I think we just want to keep these things in-house, at least for the time being."

We've won some pretty significant contracts.

That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff."

We're obviously seeing it in other businesses, but that's probably our highest volume. And as we continue to move forward, you're going to see that increase not only there, but across all of our product suites.
As we model out and look forward, we're starting to do some internal modeling around what we call Tyler 2030.

And maybe this is related to some of the hiring commentary that you folks had mentioned on services. But can you just talk a little bit about software and services bookings? It's been a couple of strong quarters of bookings, stronger on bookings than done on revenue, frankly. So can you just talk about what's driving that strength? And just maybe anything different this year about the conversion to revenue here versus prior years?"
309821,1790180456,2607962,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or 2 after",553,"Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or 2 after the signing before their environment stood up and we start to recognize revenues. So even with the SaaS customer, there's a lag. And then, of course, you've got a recurring revenue stream that you're starting to grow. So it may start in the third month of the quarter and so you get a month's worth of revenues, and in the next quarter you get a quarter's worth and so forth. And so that ongoing change in the mix has been a part of that with less licenses, which are typically recognized mostly upfront.
We talked about a little bit of the service pressure as well. So that also is with our -- a little bit below plan headcount there. We're, I think, not ramping up those new signings as quickly as we might once we're sort of fully staffed with our billable implementation teams. So I think that's the biggest thing.
I think in terms of just driving higher bookings, we've always said bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially around those big deals. In this quarter, a couple of those big deals that did have long sales cycles got to contract. But generally, I'd say it's sort of a combination of those factors we pointed out, pretty strong economic backdrop in budget situation around governments. It's certainly aided by the ARPA funds, the federal stimulus that's available to them. 
As we've talked about on prior calls, sometimes it's not clearly identifiable that a deal was funded with ARPA funds. Sometimes it is, and there are some of those in this quarter. Other times ARPA funds are used for something else, but it frees up money that helps perhaps make an incremental purchase or an add-on sales.
We're seeing real strength in our inside sales selling additional products to existing customers, and we believe some of that is driven by the federal stimulus. But as we've said in the past, that's sort of a long-term tailwind they've got until the end of 2024 really to commit those funds and through 2026 to spend those. And we saw a study by Brookings that indicated that at least as of the end of 2021, only about 40% of the stimulus funds had been committed yet by cities and counties. So we think there's sort of an ongoing tailwind there.
So strength in the market and then our competitive position is really strong. I mean, we continue to invest at a high level. We've got multiple products that we've added through acquisitions and internal builds. So our average sales are often bigger than they would have been in the past because we've got more products that are bundled together, things like our data and insight solution that's often bundled in a new sale, a number of our public safety products that now are often in a new sale that make that bigger. So there are a number of factors contributing to that. But yes, there is typically a lag from bookings growth to revenue growth."

So we give a lot of metrics and we recognize you probably give too many metrics. 
But I'd say, if you're looking for kind of the north star and what's really important is our model evolves, it would be those metrics around ARR and particularly, we do get the breakdown of those different components of ARR, but particularly software subscription ARR and transaction ARR. And we expect that maintenance will kind of flat right now, will start to decline as more of those customers flip to the cloud. So really, the things that probably the most important metric would be around those recurring ARs from subscriptions and transactions."

I think part of our strategy has always been to have a comprehensive suite and compete that way and sell our products as a suite as opposed to single point solutions.

I'm not really quite sure why because having to do a bunch of extra integrations, trying to get multiple vendors, just seems to me to be more of a headache rather than going to a single vendor. 
And you're right. I think one of our -- I've said a lot of times, our greatest asset is our customer base. I've used the term, it doesn't take years to develop. It takes decades to develop. And so when you look at cross-selling and upselling back into that base, that's also a big strategic driver for us going forward. 
Every quarter, the reports I'm seeing were -- our inside sales channels are continuing to outdo themselves each and every quarter.

Services aren't a high-margin business for us as it is.

Some of those are in cost of sales, particularly billable travel. So while we still currently and expect in the future to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as we did during COVID, there is billable travel returning across some segments of our business. 
And so that's having an impact from margins, which we expected. And then we've talked about some of the transaction cost, the bubble costs associated with our cloud transition and specifically with the move from our proprietary data centers to AWS. And so those things are generally in line with what we expected. 
We did have also a bit higher revenue stream from the COVID-related revenues at NIC. Those have typically a bit lower margin than Tyler's overall margin.

So I don't think there's anything terribly notable in our CapEx right now relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. 
A little bit minor changes too in our capitalization around some of our internal software development efforts, most of that being associated with the cloud optimization of some of our products. So sometimes there's a little bit of a difference of how we originally estimated it will fall and how the accounting rules ultimately end up with what we capitalize and what runs through expense."

So -- and you're right, most of our maintenance contracts are annual agreements. We do have a few multiyear ones. A small percentage of those have built-in escalators, but generally, most of them have the ability to adjust pricing on an annual basis. Some of those are tied to CPI, but I think that's probably not the majority. But there is some flexibility there. And we took a look at that this spring. Still a majority of our maintenance contracts are on the sort of the June 30, July 1 cycle, and it's something that we talked about internally back in March and April before we went out. 
As it relates to SaaS contracts, similar things. I mean we -- these are -- after you get through the initial engagement, you do have the ability to start putting in price increases. A lot of our initial SaaS deals are multiyear terms. Some of them are -- they may be built-in escalators, but the way the revenue recognition has worked historically is that we actually have been recognizing them on more of a flat rate. So there can be a little bit of a declining margin. 
It's one of the reasons why we've tried really hard to shorten the length of those initial contracts, but we're also looking at doing some things with contract terms so that we will be able to get those built-in escalators. We do price them in. So we're getting the cash in those agreements. And then as they roll off and we move into their annual renewals, we'll have the ability to change that pricing even more. But there are obviously some existing agreements that are out there that had pricing that was built in a year or 2 ago that we're -- we can't adjust at this point."

Yes, the cash flow does -- typically the third quarter, and I think that's every year, is the strongest quarter, primarily because of those maintenance billings. We have close to $470 million a year in maintenance. Not all of it, but the biggest chunk of that is renewed as of July 1. They typically build late in the second quarter and collected in the third quarter. Those they are typically don't age. So those are paid relatively promptly. So that drives that third quarter cash flow growth. 
I think some of -- there was a little bit of an anomaly last year in the second quarter around NIC shortly with -- because they were only in for part of the quarter. And there was some sort of unusual dynamics around the timing just when we acquired them, they happen to have a fair amount of, I guess, what I'd describe as customer cash that's sort of passing through that from their transaction-based revenue streams that was on their balance sheet that then was paid out, remitted on to the customers after acquisition.
So it created sort of an anomaly there. This year, it's sort of the normal full quarter, and NIC's cash flow is more consistent across the year given the transaction-based nature of most of their revenues. So I think you'll see that start to even out a little bit more. But I still think, yes, you probably see certainly more than half and more in the kind of 2/3 of our cash flow for the year in the second half of the year. But I think there was that sort of unusual situation last year."

But we're still actively looking at acquisitions. We're not -- it's not like we've closed the door. We're not answering calls. We've been actively looking. We've participated in a couple of processes this year. Obviously, we purchased US eDirect early in the year. But we need something compelling and something that's really at a reasonable valuation. 
What we've seen in the acquisition front, at least even recently, even as the broader markets have gone through a little bit of turbulence in the last few months, the expectations for some of these private companies has not changed. And in fact, in some cases, has almost exceeded. I mean if people pitch deals where they tell me that I need to be paying higher valuations than Tyler. And that's a little bit hard for me to understand. It's a bit of a head scratcher. 
Our debt right now is -- our blended rate is about -- after we make this payment this month, it will be about 2%. But that's really a function of the fact that we've paid so much debt down. When we first took out our debt, I think our convertible was about 34% of our total debt. After this payment this month, it will be more, just over 50%. So as we continue to pay our term down, we won't be as impacted by interest rates as we look out over the next year, which is nice. 
As relates to share repurchases, I think right now, I agree with you as I look out 5 years, 7 years from now, the stock could look pretty attractive. But I think unless we're really wanting to do a significant move, I'd rather just pay down the debt in the near term."

I think it's 8 of the 10 largest counties in the country something like 17 state-wide implementation. So it's a very strong product for us. But it also can be somewhat of a lumpy business, particularly with respect to those really big contracts because it is not unusual for us to see 25, 30, I think we've replaced a couple of 40-plus year old case management systems that were custom written in the 70s in some of these large counties.
And so there's sort of some long-term activity in the backdrop. We see more of the kind of mid-range deals that are more currently active in the pipeline, but I don't think there are any big statewide deals that are sort of currently actively in the market. But we do have a very high success rate as those come along. And then as we've been able to build on that really very strong position we have in the case management space, where most of our growth in courts is coming from now is from those products that we have in that suite around it.
So we mentioned on the call today, one of our bigger deals, Dallas County. Dallas County has been a long time. It's a top 10 county, been a longtime case management customer. But now we were able to add our jail solution to the products that they use. So building on that relationship, and we've done a number of acquisitions in that space, probation, jury, prosecutor, process service solutions that broaden our offerings there and enable us to grow there.

But I'd say that's kind of the baseline and that as we continue to drive more cross-selling and so more opportunities particularly in the payment space. And through things like the US eDirect acquisition, which is now a part of NIC, that there's certainly an opportunity to move up into the even into the low double-digit range.

I think as you go over time, we don't really report on specific organic growth within our business units. 
And you'll see some of that just the opportunities are there. And as payments grows, some of that payments business may go to our ERP because it's going to their client base, but NIC played a significant hand, just like the VendEngine deal in Arkansas or Kentucky, that revenue really doesn't happen without NIC, yet it's sitting on the books over in our Courts & Justice division.
So I think as we go forward, you'll probably see us less comment on their specific revenues and growth as they just become more integrated with NIC. We've kind of thought it was appropriate, really for the first year or so, but it will be like the rest of our other divisions because there's so much as we talked about, a lot of our opportunities are through cross-sells and how we leverage each other.

Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong execution that drove solid organic revenue growth and higher earnings while also advancing our cloud-first strategy. Total revenues grew approximately 3% with organic growth, excluding COVID-related revenues of approximately 9%. Recurring revenues comprised 78.5% of our quarterly revenues. 
On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenue grew 14.5%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contracts mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q3, 91% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 74% in Q3 last year. 
Our largest new software contract for the quarter was with the U.S. Department of State for our case management development platform, formerly known as entellitrak. This 5-year SaaS arrangement is valued at over $54 million and includes over $5 million of ARR in the first year, ramping to over $8.5 million of ARR in the fifth year. However, due to certain contract terms, only approximately $8 million of the value of this contract is included in backlog and bookings for the third quarter. 
The second largest deal of the quarter was a 5-year SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the Arizona office of the courts valued at over $15 million. This arrangement includes 2 5-year optional renewals and with add-on components has the potential to grow to more than $82 million over 15 years. We also signed a notable statewide SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the State of Oregon Judicial Department valued at approximately $3.5 million. These contracts are great examples of our ability to make a strategic tuck-in acquisition and grow the acquired products by leveraging our client base and sales channel. 
When we acquired CaseloadPRO, which is now our enterprise supervision product 4 years ago, its annual revenues were approximately $2.7 million. This quarter alone, our new sales of enterprise supervision added almost $4 million of ARR. 
In other Tyler divisions, we signed 5 additional significant SaaS deals each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include Pierce County, Washington for our Enterprise Assessment and Tax solution, the city of Abilene, Texas, the Resin Unified School District in Wisconsin and Alachua County, Florida for our enterprise ERP solution, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority in Ontario for enterprise permitting and licensing solution. In addition, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. 
We also signed 3 notable license deals in the quarter for enterprise public safety, enforcement Mobile and Data & Insight solutions. With Adelco County, Texas, which was funded by ARPA, the combined Regional Communications Authority in Colorado and the city of Melbourne, Florida. 
Also during the third quarter, we successfully renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Alabama, and won a competitive rebid for our enterprise contract in Maine. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Oklahoma, and our contract in Pennsylvania is expected to expire in the fourth quarter. We also converted our State of Iowa data and insights agreement from a third-party reseller to the NIC master contract. In addition, NIC signed a new 4-year SaaS agreement for our medical cannabis regulation solution with the Arkansas Department of Health, Medical cannabis licensing with ARR of approximately $450,000. 
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to comment on the Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition we announced this morning. We're extremely excited to partner with the innovative team at Rapid, who will join our payments group. Rapid is a leader in the payment solutions market with 20 years' experience and expands our capabilities with best-in-class digital disbursements. We will now be able to offer our public sector clients a reliable, scalable and secure platform for disbursing payments. 
Rapid has more than 1,500 customers concentrated in courts and correction facilities which includes managing disbursements for VendEngine, which we acquired in September of last year. 
Combined with our approximately 7,200 clients in the payment space, we believe this is a significant opportunity to leverage the full suite of market-leading payment solutions to make customer interactions stronger and more secure. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter, and our annual guidance for 2022."
309821,1804596962,2665277,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers",1177,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was strong at 9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million compared to $43.3 million in last year's third quarter. 
Revenue from the TourHealth initiative ended in the second quarter, and the Virginia rent relief program has now officially ended with less than $2 million of remaining revenues anticipated in the fourth quarter. 
License revenue declined 10.6% as our new software contract mix has shifted to SaaS even more rapidly than planned at the beginning of the year. Professional services revenues rose 15.7% and 6.3% organically. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the fourth quarter to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near term as those teams ramp up to become fully billable. 
Subscriptions revenue was just slightly above Q3 of last year due to the expected $37 million decline in COVID-related subscription revenue, but organically rose 14.5%. We added 153 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 70 existing on-premises clients, representing a total of approximately $149 million in contract value. 
In Q3 of last year, we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and had 67 on-premises conversions, representing a total of approximately $84 million in contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $28.1 million in new ARR. 
Subscription contract value comprised a new high of approximately 91% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 74% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.8 years compared to 3.4 years last year. 
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $148.9 million, down 13% but excluding COVID-related revenue, grew 11.1%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.7 million, up 13.3%. 
Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, which was flat with last year, but up 11.2%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $421.7 million, up 27.7%. Transaction-based ARR was $595.6 million, down 13%, but up 11.1%, excluding COVID-related revenues. 
Non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat with Q3 last year at $469.4 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.88 billion, up 6.3%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $499 million, down 17% on a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year for 3 main reasons. 
First, Q3 of last year included the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing renewal of approximately $63 million. Second, COVID-related revenues and bookings were approximately $43 million in Q3 last year, versus $11 million in the current quarter. And finally, most of the Federal Department of State deals signed this quarter was not included in backlog or bookings. 
Normalizing for these items, bookings grew 7.7%. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $364 million, down 17.9%, but grew 7.7% on a normalized basis. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 18.1%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.1%. 
As a result of an increase in our estimated research tax credit, our annual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were positively affected. Our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate is now 22.5%, down from the 24% previously used and the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% to adjust the year-to-date tax rate. This resulted in an $0.11 uplift to our third quarter non-GAAP EPS. For the full year, we expect this tax rate change to impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14. 
Cash flows from operations were $129.4 million, down 37% and free cash flow was $115.6 million, down 40% mainly due to the timing of working capital items such as payroll accruals, remittance of portal fees and taxes, and we expect to see positive impacts of these timing items in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $190 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $665 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.085 billion and cash and investments of $247.9 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. The remaining $485 million is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026, with interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. So our exposure to floating rates is limited. 
We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.79x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Looking forward, we have adjusted the upper end of our full year revenue guidance to reflect lower license revenue as a result of a higher SaaS mix as well as the timing of new license contracts in our Public Safety and federal divisions along with ongoing pressures on professional services revenue. 
Adjusted for the change in our effective tax rate, the midpoint of our non-EPS guidance is unchanged. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows: we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.837 billion and $1.857 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $49 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenue from TourHealth ended in the second quarter, while revenue from the rent relief program is expected to end in the fourth quarter. 
We expect GAAP EPS will be between $3.89 and $4.05 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.51 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, including approximately $7 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. 
For the full year, the net impact of the change in our tax rate, offset by increases in estimated interest expense, resulted in a $0.02 net reduction in non-GAAP EPS compared to our initial guidance. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for his comments."

We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characterist",595,"Thanks, Brian. We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characteristics of the public sector market is its relative stability across economic cycles, given the ongoing need to upgrade and replace aging mission-critical systems with next-generation applications.
Our deep domain expertise, combined with the breadth of our product offerings, underscores our unique ability to deliver scalable and innovative digital solutions to meet these mission-critical needs. Our industry-leading competitive position remains high, in part due to our integrated solutions and our ability to expand existing client relationships as we leverage our installed base, the largest in the public sector market. 
Our cross-sell pipeline continues to grow, particularly as we begin to gain momentum with our NIC go-to-market strategy and leverage our strong sales organization and client relationships. Our pipeline of sell-through opportunities with NIC State Enterprise relationships expanded approximately 16% in the third quarter with emerging opportunities across multiple solutions with many influenced by our Enterprise Data and Insights offering. 
Additionally, we are seeing larger deal opportunities in the pipeline that require longer procurement cycles. Our cloud-first strategy is also tracking well as we continue to invest in optimizing products for more efficient cloud deployment and as higher cloud adoption is reflected in the mix of our new business pipeline. 
Our expectation of the SaaS mix for new business for this year and 2023 have increased since the beginning of the year. We've talked about the impact of our accelerated move to the cloud on our margins in 2022. And the expectation that we will see further margin contraction in 2023 before rebounding in 2024. 
In addition to impacting margins, the accelerated pace and the shift in new business mix towards SaaS puts pressure on revenue growth as we now expect 2022 license revenue to decline more than previously expected. We expect that trend to continue into 2023 and we are pleased that our early planning for next year indicates that SaaS adoption should increase even faster than previously expected, even in our Public Safety and federal divisions. 
As a result, we expect to see license revenue decline even more previously than anticipated with the license decline in the 40% range. Also, a reminder that with NIC's COVID-related initiatives now finished, $49 million of 2022 revenues, of which $11 million were in subscriptions and $38 million were in professional services will not be present in 2023. 
Despite current macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy, capitalizing on the durability of our recurring revenue model and solid financial position. We have a proven and successful track record of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that support our growth priorities, expand our product portfolio and extend our TAM. 
As we have commented in the past, we have the benefit of reliable cash flow, enabling us to aggressively manage our debt profile and impact from rising interest rates. We expect to continue to delever and use excess cash to reduce debt while still taking advantage of strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations such as Rapid, which further enhances our ability to address the significant public sector payments TAM. 
Our business is resilient. And while we are not immune to the effects of inflation, the long-term capital investment decisions we've made in strengthening our products and shifting to a cloud-first approach are foundational to driving sustainable growth and delivering stakeholder value. 
With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

First 1 is there was a mention of the ARPA project that was funded using federal funds. Could you kind of give us a characterization of what you guys see as the pipeline of potential projects and opportunities that are coming directly from federal funds? 
And on the second question -- my next question would be, on the comment regarding longer procurement cycles. And I think what's a little bit intriguing about you guys making this comment is that it seems to be that there is a significant amount of federal funds being allocated to local governments, federal government and several other branches. And you think that with those funds being allocated and the speed of those allocations that are now starting to accelerate, do you think that lead times and procurement cycles would actually start to either stay the same or compress. So I was hoping you could just kind of explain to us what's going on regarding longer procurement cycles."

As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidevo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. 
I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing. I think our comments around the -- what we're starting to see is more and more receptiveness in public safety to potentially move into the SaaS world. But yes, it was funded by ARPA. We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. 
The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer. So if we misspoke there, I want to make that clarification."

So I think what we're seeing is different divisions, different product suites have been moving at different paces to the cloud. Some of them we've talked before, like this year, our enterprise ERP solution is almost exclusively this year, and we budgeted this year to move to the cloud. 
Our lower end, or formerly our LGD, but our ERP Pro solution has continued to go at accelerated rates. What we're seeing is in areas, for example, like our enterprise permitting and licensing solution, we budgeted this year that all new deals there would be 75% SaaS. And what we're seeing is they're 100% SaaS. We're starting to see it in our property and recording solutions, particularly our recording solution. We budgeted this year at 60% SaaS, it's 85% SaaS. 
What we're starting to see now also in the market and as we look into next year, is our 2 divisions, which have had really more dependency on licenses, particularly in the last couple of years has obviously been public safety and Tyler Federal. Tyler Federal has been moving, I think, a little bit faster to SaaS. And we've talked before in the past about public safety's lag. But public safety, what we're seeing now and as we're looking into next year, we're looking at a lot higher subscription-based arrangements probably more so than we anticipated earlier in the year. And so as we look into 2023, we're seeing the effects now -- but as we preliminary model -- and again, this is not a 2023 call, but as we preliminarily look out to 2023, we see the licenses declining at a faster rate than we anticipated.

So as we talked about in earlier question and during the prepared remarks, a very early look at next year's revenue plans would have licenses declining, perhaps around 40%. And as you know, licenses are very, very high margins. So -- and the time it takes the offsetting subscription revenues for the same deals in a subscription form to ramp up, there's a lag there. So that would be the biggest downside pressure. 
The COVID revenue is going away generally. The COVID revenues, at least early on, the tour Health revenues were at lower than our average margins, the Virginia rent relief program margins were more in line with our overall margin. So less of an uplift from those going away, but maybe overall a slight positive impact. 
And then subscriptions revenue -- I mean, services revenues, we've talked about being under some pressure, mostly from us still ramping up staffing. The services revenues typically are low to no margin revenues. And so the absence of those in the short term has a positive impact. But again, we expect to ultimately build those back up. So probably not as much of an overall impact from those, but potentially a slight positive impact from those being a little lighter. But certainly, the license decline around that shift is going to be the biggest factor by us taking a big step forward with that next year."

As you noted it's not a lack of services revenues coming in or the contracts being signed and then getting to the related initiation of the subscription revenues, but there have been delays around that. And we added a significant class or classes in late Q2 and have continued to hire in Q3 and Q4. It does seem that turnover, which has been at an elevated level with us as with many companies, does seem to be moderating somewhat. So that's a positive. But we think it's still -- it will take -- there's roughly, call it, a 6-month lag time from the time we hire someone to the time they're really fully trained and billable. So this is a multiple quarter sort of exercise to catch back up. And it probably in some of the subscription deals is causing us to be maybe like a quarter or so behind when we might otherwise have started recognizing those revenues I guess, to an offsetting factor to some extent, our clients have often had elevated turnover as well. And so some of it is around client readiness to begin a project. And so some of these projects are delayed slightly because clients need to staff up before they're ready to launch into implementation. So we've seen effects from both sides and -- but there is some lag in the startup of subscription deals that are in backlog."

And again, we're not giving 2023 guidance yet. We've had more work around the revenue side than on the other side that we're not really in a position to talk about other than we do expect further compression about the extent of that next year on the margin perspective. I'd say next year, on maintenance, we'd expect that to be down probably low single digits based on the normal increases, the shift in new business more towards the cloud and then the lower level of licenses both this year -- of new licenses, both this year and next year, but I think it's still probably a low single-digit decline. 
The cash flow, yes, I'd say probably our expectations for this year have ticked down a bit around that timing. We do believe that a lot of these sort of timing changes that impacted this quarter versus the same quarter last year, turnaround in the fourth quarter. For example, at crude payroll, we had an extra payroll that ran through cash this quarter compared to last year. I think that turns around in Q4, but payroll for us today is close to $30 million. So that's shift from what we see in Q3 to what we see in Q4. Last year, some of the timing of NIC revenues, the flow of cash around their portals caused a bigger -- sort of a shift from Q2 last year to Q3 of last year. So it skews the comparison for this year a bit. 
And so I think probably our expectation has come down a bit, but that a lot of this lightness in Q3 moves the other way into Q4. And as we said on the tax side, and with the change in our tax rate, that's not just a book tax rate, those are also cash taxes. And so we expect to have lower cash tax payments, actually no federal tax payment in Q4 and much lighter tax payments next year as well. 
And I'd say the overall mix on revenues and margins for next year, probably -- net-net, we probably come out pretty similar to this year's cash flow with maybe our increase is a bit less than we previously expected, but we still expect cash flow to grow. And part of that also, of course, interest will be significantly lower next year as a result of the debt payments we've made this year."

As you know, we view payments as really a significant long-term growth driver. And just a little history, remember, we were already in payments. We made the NIC acquisition because they were the leader in public sector payments. But really, our expertise was on the acquiring side of payments. We had on our road map to get more involved on really the issuing side, generating the payouts. 
And we actually believe the issuing side of payments is about -- the TAM is about the same size as the acquiring side. When you talk about issuing side of payments, you monetize it by things like transaction load fees, there's interchange revenue, there's account fees. And Rapid was already currently in courts and corrections on the issuing side. That's -- again, that's an area we did not have expertise in, but something that we would have tried to build out sometime over time. But our focus still was on the acquiring side. 
We think in the near term, we can -- we've already proven it because they were a partner of VendEngine that we can in the near term, expand that presence in courts and corrections given our footprint. But then as we look across our Tyler portfolio and market presence, we see a lot of opportunities -- other opportunities in the Justice space where it's Jura payments or in make work release or things like that on the state side, unemployment, unclaimed property, tax refunds, parks and outdoor, enterprise, federal, social services. There's all kinds of avenues that I think we can build this out across our portfolio of existing products. 
Caution is always, as we do acquisitions, they take time, but bringing in that expertise is something that gives us the full end-to-end cycle with respect to payments that we didn't have before. And so we're pretty excited about this opportunity. Obviously, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, a lot to go execute on, but it really rounds us out in the complete cycle where I don't think anybody else has the ability to play in that cycle."

There are continuous pressures on wages. We're trying to address that where we can. But but the labor market is tough right now. And we're trying to keep our people. We've got really good benefits.

The comparison to last end and we feel good about the continued trend towards more more cloud in the new bookings. 
The comparison, as we said, was very difficult because we had a big -- well, in overall bookings last year, it wasn't a software booking, but the e-filing in Illinois was a $63 million value. The -- and then, of course, the COVID revenues flow through bookings and the reduction there affected it as well. But that was certainly expected.

And this year, there being a significant amount. Generally, we would expect to see really good growth there, mostly around the payment side. We believe that over time, the portal revenues will continue to trend upward as more and more citizens look to do more things digitally with government that they used to do through another channel in person or through the mail and that governments look to be able to provide more of those services digitally to citizens. 
But I think the big growth there, we've talked about, we expect to continue to see our payments business grow meaningfully through things like with the Rapid acquisition, getting more into the dispersing side and driving the NIC payments platform that's currently primarily at the state level down into our local government customers, and we expect to start to see fruits of that next year. 
In general, the margins on payments are a bit lower, particularly where we have gross contracts. There's a mix of growth in net, but generally, the margins are a bit lower there. But as far as incremental growth opportunities, we do expect to see, if you're looking out, say, over the next 5 to 7 years, significant growth around the payment side."

So that will have actually a revenue headwind next year, but it will be a more positive margin headwind.

Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong execution that drove solid organic revenue growth and higher earnings while also advancing our cloud-first strategy. Total revenues grew approximately 3% with organic growth, excluding COVID-related revenues of approximately 9%. Recurring revenues comprised 78.5% of our quarterly revenues.  
On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenue grew 14.5%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contracts mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses.  
In Q3, 91% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 74% in Q3 last year.  
Our largest new software contract for the quarter was with the U.S. Department of State for our case management development platform, formerly known as entellitrak. This 5-year SaaS arrangement is valued at over $54 million and includes over $5 million of ARR in the first year, ramping to over $8.5 million of ARR in the fifth year. However, due to certain contract terms, only approximately $8 million of the value of this contract is included in backlog and bookings for the third quarter.  
The second largest deal of the quarter was a 5-year SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the Arizona office of the courts valued at over $15 million. This arrangement includes 2 5-year optional renewals and with add-on components has the potential to grow to more than $82 million over 15 years. We also signed a notable statewide SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the state of Oregon judicial department valued at approximately $3.5 million. These contracts are great examples of our ability to make a strategic tuck-in acquisition and grow the acquired products by leveraging our client base and sales channel.  
When we acquired CaseloadPRO, which is enterprise supervision product 4 years ago, its annual revenues were approximately $2.7 million. This quarter alone, our new sales of enterprise supervision added almost $4 million of ARR.  
In other Tyler divisions, we signed 5 additional significant SaaS deals each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include Pierce County, Washington for our Enterprise Assessment and Tax solution, the city of Abilene, Texas, the Resin Unified School District in Wisconsin and Alachua County, Florida for our enterprise ERP solution, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority in Ontario for enterprise permitting and licensing solution. In addition, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each.  
We also signed 3 notable license deals in the quarter for enterprise public safety, enforcement Mobile and Data & Insight solutions. With Adelco County, Texas, which was funded by ARPA, the combined Regional Communications Authority in Colorado and the city of Melbourne, Florida.
Also during the third quarter, we successfully renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Alabama, and won a competitive rebid for our enterprise contract in Maine. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Oklahoma, and our contract in Pennsylvania is expected to expire in the fourth quarter. We also converted our State of Iowa data and insights agreement from a third-party reseller to the NIC master contract. In addition, NIC signed a new 4-year SaaS agreement for our medical cannabis regulation solution with the Arkansas Department of Health, Medical cannabis licensing with ARR of approximately $450,000.  
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to comment on the Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition we announced this morning. We're extremely excited to partner with the innovative team at Rapid, who will join our payments group. Rapid is a leader in the payment solutions market with 20 years' experience and expands our capabilities with best-in-class digital disbursements. We will now be able to offer our public sector clients a reliable, scalable and secure platform for disbursing payments.  
Rapid has more than 1,500 customers concentrated in courts and correction facilities which includes managing disbursements for VendEngine, which we acquired in September of last year.  
Combined with our approximately 7,200 clients in the payment space, we believe this is a significant opportunity to leverage the full suite of market-leading payment solutions to make customer interactions stronger and more secure.  
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter, and our annual guidance for 2022."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers",1177,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.  
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was strong at 9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million compared to $43.3 million in last year's third quarter.  
Revenue from the TourHealth initiative ended in the second quarter, and the Virginia rent relief program has now officially ended with less than $2 million of remaining revenues anticipated in the fourth quarter.  
License revenue declined 10.6% as our new software contract mix has shifted to SaaS even more rapidly than planned at the beginning of the year. Professional services revenues rose 15.7% and 6.3% organically. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the fourth quarter to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near term as those teams ramp up to become fully billable.  
Subscriptions revenue was just slightly above Q3 of last year due to the expected $37 million decline in COVID-related subscription revenue, but organically rose 14.5%. We added 153 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 70 existing on-premises clients, representing a total of approximately $149 million in contract value.  
In Q3 of last year, we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and had 67 on-premises conversions, representing a total of approximately $84 million in contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $28.1 million in new ARR.  
Subscription contract value comprised a new high of approximately 91% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 74% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.8 years compared to 3.4 years last year.  
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $148.9 million, down 13% but excluding COVID-related revenue, grew 11.1%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.7 million, up 13.3%.  
Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, which was flat with last year, but up 11.2%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $421.7 million, up 27.7%. Transaction-based ARR was $595.6 million, down 13%, but up 11.1%, excluding COVID-related revenues.  
Non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat with Q3 last year at $469.4 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.88 billion, up 6.3%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $499 million, down 17% on a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year for 3 main reasons.  
First, Q3 of last year included the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing renewal of approximately $63 million. Second, COVID-related revenues and bookings were approximately $43 million in Q3 last year, versus $11 million in the current quarter. And finally, most of the Federal Department of State deals signed this quarter was not included in backlog or bookings.  
Normalizing for these items, bookings grew 7.7%. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $364 million, down 17.9% but grew 7.7% on a normalized basis. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 18.1%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.1%.  
As a result of an increase in our estimated research tax credit, our annual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were positively affected. Our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate is now 22.5%, down from the 24% previously used and the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% to adjust the year-to-date tax rate. This resulted in an $0.11 uplift to our third quarter non-GAAP EPS. For the full year, we expect this tax rate change to impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14.  
Cash flows from operations were $129.4 million, down 37% and free cash flow was $115.6 million, down 40% mainly due to the timing of working capital items such as payroll accruals, remittance of portal fees and taxes, and we expect to see positive impacts of these timing items in the fourth quarter.  
We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $190 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $665 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.085 billion and cash and investments of $247.9 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. The remaining $485 million is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026, with interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. So our exposure to floating rates is limited.  
We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.79x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Looking forward, we have adjusted the upper end of our full year revenue guidance to reflect lower license revenue as a result of a higher SaaS mix as well as the timing of new license contracts in our Public Safety and federal divisions along with ongoing pressures on professional services revenue.  
Adjusted for the change in our effective tax rate, the midpoint of our non-EPS guidance is unchanged. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows: we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.837 billion and $1.857 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $49 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenue from TourHealth ended in the second quarter, while revenue from the rent relief program is expected to end in the fourth quarter.  
We expect GAAP EPS will be between $3.89 and $4.05 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.51 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, including approximately $7 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs.  
For the full year, the net impact of the change in our tax rate, offset by increases in estimated interest expense, resulted in a $0.02 net reduction in non-GAAP EPS compared to our initial guidance. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release.  
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for his comments."

We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characterist",595,"Thanks, Brian. We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characteristics of the public sector market is its relative stability across economic cycles, given the ongoing need to upgrade and replace aging mission-critical systems with next-generation applications.
Our deep domain expertise, combined with the breadth of our product offerings, underscores our unique ability to deliver scalable and innovative digital solutions to meet these mission-critical needs. Our industry-leading competitive position remains high, in part due to our integrated solutions and our ability to expand existing client relationships as we leverage our installed base, the largest in the public sector market. 
Our cross-sell pipeline continues to grow, particularly as we begin to gain momentum with our NIC go-to-market strategy and leverage our strong sales organization and client relationships. Our pipeline of sell-through opportunities with NIC State Enterprise relationships expanded approximately 16% in the third quarter with emerging opportunities across multiple solutions with many influenced by our Enterprise Data and Insights offering. 
Additionally, we are seeing larger deal opportunities in the pipeline that require longer procurement cycles. Our cloud-first strategy is also tracking well as we continue to invest in optimizing products for more efficient cloud deployment and as higher cloud adoption is reflected in the mix of our new business pipeline. 
Our expectation of the SaaS mix for new business for this year and 2023 have increased since the beginning of the year. We've talked about the impact of our accelerated move to the cloud on our margins in 2022. And the expectation that we will see further margin contraction in 2023 before rebounding in 2024. 
In addition to impacting margins, the accelerated pace and the shift in new business mix towards SaaS puts pressure on revenue growth as we now expect 2022 license revenue to decline more than previously expected. We expect that trend to continue into 2023 and we are pleased that our early planning for next year indicates that SaaS adoption should increase even faster than previously expected, even in our Public Safety and federal divisions. 
As a result, we expect to see license revenue decline even more previously than anticipated with the license decline in the 40% range. Also, a reminder that with NIC's COVID-related initiatives now finished, $49 million of 2022 revenues, of which $11 million were in subscriptions and $38 million were in professional services will not be present in 2023. 
Despite current macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy, capitalizing on the durability of our recurring revenue model and solid financial position. We have a proven and successful track record of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that support our growth priorities, expand our product portfolio and extend our TAM. 
As we have commented in the past, we have the benefit of reliable cash flow, enabling us to aggressively manage our debt profile and impact from rising interest rates. We expect to continue to delever and use excess cash to reduce debt while still taking advantage of strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations such as Rapid, which further enhances our ability to address the significant public sector payments TAM. 
Our business is resilient. And while we are not immune to the effects of inflation, the long-term capital investment decisions we've made in strengthening our products and shifting to a cloud-first approach are foundational to driving sustainable growth and delivering stakeholder value. 
With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

First one is there was a mention of the ARPA project that was funded using federal funds. Could you kind of give us a characterization of what you guys see as the pipeline of potential projects and opportunities that are coming directly from federal funds? 
And on the second question -- my next question would be, on the comment regarding longer procurement cycles. And I think what's a little bit intriguing about you guys making this comment is that it seems to be that there is a significant amount of federal funds being allocated to local governments, federal government and several other branches. And you think that with those funds being allocated and the speed of those allocations that are now starting to accelerate, do you think that lead times and procurement cycles would actually start to either stay the same or compress. So I was hoping you could just kind of explain to us what's going on regarding longer procurement cycles."

As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidalgo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. 
I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing. I think our comments around the -- what we're starting to see is more and more receptiveness in public safety to potentially move into the SaaS world. But yes, it was funded by ARPA. We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. 
The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer. So if we misspoke there, I want to make that clarification."

So I think what we're seeing is different divisions, different product suites have been moving at different paces to the cloud. Some of them we've talked before, like this year, our enterprise ERP solution is almost exclusively this year, and we budgeted this year to move to the cloud. 
Our lower end, or formerly our LGD, but our ERP Pro solution has continued to go at accelerated rates. What we're seeing is in areas, for example, like our enterprise permitting and licensing solution, we budgeted this year that all new deals there would be 75% SaaS. And what we're seeing is they're 100% SaaS. We're starting to see it in our property and recording solutions, particularly our recording solution. We budgeted this year at 60% SaaS, it's 85% SaaS. 
What we're starting to see now also in the market and as we look into next year, is our 2 divisions, which have had really more dependency on licenses, particularly in the last couple of years has obviously been public safety and Tyler Federal. Tyler Federal has been moving, I think, a little bit faster to SaaS. And we've talked before in the past about public safety's lag. But public safety, what we're seeing now and as we're looking into next year, we're looking at a lot higher subscription-based arrangements probably more so than we anticipated earlier in the year. And so as we look into 2023, we're seeing the effects now -- but as we preliminary model -- and again, this is not a 2023 call, but as we preliminarily look out to 2023, we see the licenses declining at a faster rate than we anticipated.

So as we talked about in earlier question and during the prepared remarks, a very early look at next year's revenue plans would have licenses declining, perhaps around 40%. And as you know, licenses are very, very high margins. So -- and the time it takes the offsetting subscription revenues for the same deals in a subscription form to ramp up, there's a lag there. So that would be the biggest downside pressure. 
The COVID revenue is going away generally. The COVID revenues, at least early on, the TourHealth revenues were at lower than our average margins, the Virginia rent relief program margins were more in line with our overall margin. So less of an uplift from those going away, but maybe overall a slight positive impact. 
And then subscriptions revenue -- I mean, services revenues, we've talked about being under some pressure, mostly from us still ramping up staffing. The services revenues typically are low to no margin revenues. And so the absence of those in the short term has a positive impact. But again, we expect to ultimately build those back up. So probably not as much of an overall impact from those, but potentially a slight positive impact from those being a little lighter. But certainly, the license decline around that shift is going to be the biggest factor by us taking a big step forward with that next year."

As you noted it's not a lack of services revenues coming in or the contracts being signed and then getting to the related initiation of the subscription revenues, but there have been delays around that. And we added a significant class or classes in late Q2 and have continued to hire in Q3 and Q4. It does seem that turnover, which has been at an elevated level with us as with many companies, does seem to be moderating somewhat. So that's a positive. But we think it's still -- it will take -- there's roughly, call it, a 6-month lag time from the time we hire someone to the time they're really fully trained and billable. So this is a multiple quarter sort of exercise to catch back up. And it probably in some of the subscription deals is causing us to be maybe like a quarter or so behind when we might otherwise have started recognizing those revenues I guess, to an offsetting factor to some extent, our clients have often had elevated turnover as well. And so some of it is around client readiness to begin a project. And so some of these projects are delayed slightly because clients need to staff up before they're ready to launch into implementation. So we've seen effects from both sides and -- but there is some lag in the startup of subscription deals that are in backlog."

And again, we're not giving 2023 guidance yet. We've had more work around the revenue side than on the other side that we're not really in a position to talk about other than we do expect further compression about the extent of that next year on the margin perspective. I'd say next year, on maintenance, we'd expect that to be down probably low single digits based on the normal increases, the shift in new business more towards the cloud and then the lower level of licenses both this year -- of new licenses, both this year and next year, but I think it's still probably a low single-digit decline. 
The cash flow, yes, I'd say probably our expectations for this year have ticked down a bit around that timing. We do believe that a lot of these sort of timing changes that impacted this quarter versus the same quarter last year, turnaround in the fourth quarter. For example, at crude payroll, we had an extra payroll that ran through cash this quarter compared to last year. I think that turns around in Q4, but payroll for us today is close to $30 million. So that's shift from what we see in Q3 to what we see in Q4. Last year, some of the timing of NIC revenues, the flow of cash around their portals caused a bigger -- sort of a shift from Q2 last year to Q3 of last year. So it skews the comparison for this year a bit. 
And so I think probably our expectation has come down a bit, but that a lot of this lightness in Q3 moves the other way into Q4. And as we said on the tax side, and with the change in our tax rate, that's not just a book tax rate, those are also cash taxes. And so we expect to have lower cash tax payments, actually no federal tax payment in Q4 and much lighter tax payments next year as well. 
And I'd say the overall mix on revenues and margins for next year, probably -- net-net, we probably come out pretty similar to this year's cash flow with maybe our increase is a bit less than we previously expected, but we still expect cash flow to grow. And part of that also, of course, interest will be significantly lower next year as a result of the debt payments we've made this year."

As you know, we view payments as really a significant long-term growth driver. And just a little history, remember, we were already in payments. We made the NIC acquisition because they were the leader in public sector payments. But really, our expertise was on the acquiring side of payments. We had on our road map to be get more involved on really the issuing side, generating the payouts. 
And we actually believe the issuing side of payments is about -- the TAM is about the same size as the acquiring side. When you talk about issuing side of payments, you monetize it by things like transaction load fees, there's interchange revenue, there's account fees. And Rapid was already currently in courts and corrections on the issuing side. That's -- again, that's an area we did not have expertise in, but something that we would have tried to build out sometime over time. But our focus still was on the acquiring side. 
We think in the near term, we can -- we've already proven it because they were a partner of VendEngine that we can in the near term, expand that presence in courts and corrections given our footprint. But then as we look across our Tyler portfolio and market presence, we see a lot of opportunities -- other opportunities in the Justice space where it's [indiscernible] payments or in make work release or things like that on the state side, unemployment, unclaimed property, tax refunds, parks and outdoor, enterprise, federal, social services. There's all kinds of avenues that I think we can build this out across our portfolio of existing products. 
Caution is always, as we do acquisitions, they take time, but bringing in that expertise is something that gives us the full end-to-end cycle with respect to payments that we didn't have before. And so we're pretty excited about this opportunity. Obviously, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, a lot to go execute on, but it really rounds us out in the complete cycle where I don't think anybody else has the ability to play in that cycle."

So the highest -- it grew sequentially from last quarter from $126 million to $145 million. It's double what the first quarter total contract value was. So net-net, we feel really good about it. The comparison to last end and we feel good about the continued trend towards more cloud in the new bookings. 
The comparison, as we said, was very difficult because we had a big -- well, in overall bookings last year, it wasn't a software booking, but the e-filing in Illinois was a $63 million value. The -- and then, of course, the COVID revenues flow through bookings and the reduction there affected it as well. But that was certainly expected. So I'd say in an overall sense, probably the number of contracts and the value of those contracts was a bit higher than we expected coming into the quarter and skewed a bit by the Department of State deal."

And this year, there being a significant amount. Generally, we would expect to see really good growth there, mostly around the payment side. We believe that over time, the portal revenues will continue to trend upward as more and more citizens look to do more things digitally with government that they used to do through another channel in person or through the mail and that governments look to be able to provide more of those services digitally to citizens. 
But I think the big growth there, we've talked about, we expect to continue to see our payments business grow meaningfully through things like with the Rapid acquisition, getting more into the dispersing side and driving the NIC payments platform that's currently primarily at the state level down into our local government customers, and we expect to start to see fruits of that next year. 
In general, the margins on payments are a bit lower, particularly where we have growth contracts. There's a mix of growth in net, but generally, the margins are a bit lower there. But as far as incremental growth opportunities, we do expect to see, if you're looking out, say, over the next 5 to 7 years, significant growth around the payment side."

For example, as we announced last quarter, we won the competitive rebid for South Carolina. In the past, that was a gross revenue payment contracts. That's actually shifting to a net revenue. So that will have actually a revenue headwind next year, but it will be a more positive margin headwind. So as we sort of map out our payments future, and figure out exactly where we think we're going to be growing growth side, where we'll be growing debt side, we'll probably be able to give a little better color there."
