Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, net cash from operations of $2.9 billion and a company record free cash flow of nearly $2.2 billion. These",732,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, net cash from operations of $2.9 billion and a company record free cash flow of nearly $2.2 billion. These results were made possible by the exceptional performance of the CF Industries team. We managed through 2 severe weather events in North America, completed the highest level of maintenance activity in our company's history, navigated runaway gas cost in the U.K. and adeptly responded to a rapidly changing marketplace for our product. 
Consistent with our do-it-right culture, we did all of this safely. Our year-end recordable incident rate was 0.32 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, outstanding by any measure, but truly remarkable given the challenges of the year. 
 
Several of the factors that drove these terrific results in 2021 are expected to persist into the foreseeable future, namely strong demand, high-energy spread differentials and outstanding execution by our team. Let's start with the robust demand component. Significantly improving grain prices drove strong agricultural demand while economic recovery led to high industrial use as well. 
With December corn trading at $5.90 this year and [ $5.56 ] for next year, we see strong ag demand for at least the next 2 years. On the economy-driven industrial demand side, the last 2 years have seen inflation -- the last 2 months have seen inflation at 7% year-over-year, and that doesn't appear to be slowing down. So the combination of strong ag and industrial demand suggests overall global demand for nitrogen will continue at a torrid pace. 
Energy spread differentials between North America and high-cost Europe and Asia production exceeded $20 per MMBtu for most of the fourth quarter, which provided the opportunity for us to achieve record margins for our products. As we look forward, the energy spreads continue in the $18 to $20 range for the balance of this year and remain well above $10 for '23 and '24. 
Those energy differentials provide an extremely attractive environment for North American producers and give us a lot of confidence about our continuing cash generation potential. On top of this backdrop of very strong demand and high energy spreads were a set of factors that negatively impacted global supply in '21. 
Turnarounds and maintenance activity originally scheduled for 2020 was deferred into '21 because of the COVID pandemic and a desire to keep employees safe by limiting contractors coming on site. The catch-up in maintenance activities last year took an unusual amount of production out of the global supply. Two significant weather events in North America, Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida further reduced production. 
The natural gas price spike in Europe and Asia, exceeding $30 per MMBtu for weeks at a time, caused plans to curtail or shut down in those regions, further reducing supply. And adding to these pressures, several important producing countries in an effort to ensure nitrogen availability and affordability in their home markets, enacted export limitations or outright bands, including China, Russia, Egypt and Turkey. 
The result was significantly constrained supply at the exact time demand was surging, which led to the predictable outcome of rapidly increasing nitrogen prices. These dynamics came to a head in the second half of the year, and in particular, during the fourth quarter of '21 when global nitrogen prices reached record highs. This provided the market opportunity for the company to deliver an all-time record quarter, both in terms of EBITDA and free cash flow. 
This enabled us to return $800 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We paid $500 million of long-term debt and return to investment-grade credit ratings, while adding roughly $1 billion of cash to the balance sheet. As I said earlier, we believe the market dynamics of last year have plenty of runway ahead. 
To this environment, we bring unique capabilities honed over the past decade. Our investments in people, safety and growth have built the industry's highest-performing manufacturing network, as shown on Slide 6 of our materials. Slide under -- Slide 10 underscores how this advantage is amplified by the low-cost position that North American natural gas provides us. 
As a result, we are able to capture the significant margin opportunities in front of us. Now let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Bert?"

We believe industry fundamentals point to a continued tight global nitrogen supply and demand balance and an extended period of positive operating conditions for low-cost producers like CF Industries. Global nitrogen demand remains robust, u",383,"Thanks, Tony. We believe industry fundamentals point to a continued tight global nitrogen supply and demand balance and an extended period of positive operating conditions for low-cost producers like CF Industries. Global nitrogen demand remains robust, underpinned by the need to replenish global grain stocks. As you can see on Slide 9, global course grain stocks-to-use ratios remain low, supporting high crop prices and another strong year for farm incomes. 
High demand for coarse grains leads to high demand for our products, as farmers are incentivized to apply fertilizer to maximize yield. This helped drive our strongest fall ammonia application season since 2012, and our expectations for a high level of coarse grains planting this year, we project that 91 million to 93 million of acres of corn will be planted in the United States, along with strong wheat, cotton and canola plantings across North America. 
We believe it will take at least 2 more growing seasons that trend yields to fully replenish global stocks, supporting continued strong agricultural demand. At the same time, increased economic activity is driving industrial demand for ammonia, urea and diesel exhaust fluid. We had record [ DES ] sales volumes in 2021 and expect continued growth for this important emissions control product. 
Against this demand outlook, we believe global nitrogen inventory today is low. This reflects the impact of both strong demand and lower global production in 2021. Looking ahead, we expect global supply to remain challenged by high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia, along with coal costs and tightening environmental regulations in China. This should continue to affect the profitability of producers in these areas and lead to lower operating rates. 
Additionally, natural gas forward curves suggest continued favorable energy spreads for North American producers compared to marginal producers in Europe, as you can see on Slide 10. We are well positioned for the spring fertilizer application season ahead. We are pleased with our order book, which we began to build at peak prices in the fourth quarter. Our manufacturing network is operating at a high level, and we look forward to leveraging our logistics and distribution capabilities to meet demand as fertilizer applications and planting begins in North America in a few weeks. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $917 million or $4.24 per diluted share. EBITDA was approximately $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA was just over $2.7 billion. Net earnings and EBITDA reflect pretax noncash impairment charges of $521 million related to our U.K. operations. For the fourth quarter of 2021, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $705 million and EBITDA was $1.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.26 billion. 
Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in the quarter were both company records. These financial results allowed us to opportunistically accelerate capital return to shareholders at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $490 million, effectively completing the $1 billion share repurchase program that expired at the end of 2021. 
Since 2019, we have repurchased nearly 19 million shares. We continue to view share repurchases as an important tool for return on and return of capital. As you can see on Slides 13 and 14, over the last decade, we have invested in the business to grow free cash flow, while at the same time, lowering the outstanding share count. 
As a result, shareholders have accrued more of the asset base, doubling their free cash flow participation on a per share basis compared to our prior free cash flow record back in 2011. We believe our new $1.5 billion share repurchase program provides us a strong platform to build on this performance. At the same time, we remain focused on disciplined investments in clean energy that offer returns above our cost of capital. 
We have begun construction on the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville with completion expected in 2023. This year, we'll begin work on the installation of dehydration and compression equipment at Donaldsonville to enable production of blue ammonia. We believe these projects are well timed to accelerate the growth of a global market for blue and green ammonia. We also continue to have productive discussions with leading companies who share our belief in ammonia's clean energy attributes, and its role in decarbonizing economies around the world. 
Our estimated CapEx spending for 2022 of $500 million to $550 million includes expenditures for the Donaldsonville blue and green ammonia projects. And through 2025, we have committed $385 million in capital to these projects and installation of dehydration and compression equipment at Yazoo City. We also remain committed to reducing the gross debt on the company from $3.5 billion to $3 billion by the middle of 2023. 
We start 2022 with a strong balance sheet, positive multiyear industry outlook and stable maintenance CapEx plans for the next few years. We also expect gross ammonia production in the years ahead to return to typical levels of 9.5 million to 10 million tons, supporting higher sales volumes compared to 2021. As a result, we expect to have significant excess free cash flow to deploy in the years ahead. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

Our performance would not be possible without their commitment and dedication. Our results last year highlight the success we have had investing in the business to grow capacity and cash generation, while at the same time lowering our share count. 
We are currently at an all-time low for shares outstanding. In fact, almost 20% below our IPO level. With a record year for free cash flow, coupled with our lowest share count, our cash flow per share is truly spectacular. Despite that, our equity appears undervalued given our free cash flow yield. I'd encourage you to look through our materials on Slides 13, 14 and 15 to see exactly what I'm talking about. 
But what is really exciting and has all of us very bullish is the party is just beginning. We have reduced our fixed charges and debt levels and are again investment grade. We have only modest capital requirements over the next couple of years, which includes our investments in clean energy and decarbonization. Futures for grain prices and energy spreads suggest we have a long runway ahead with significant margin and cash generation opportunity, and we are sitting at our lowest share count ever. 
In short, things are pretty good, and we are just getting started. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

But the cost of green ammonia remains, particularly in North America where we've got access to low-cost gas and have options for sequestering the CO2 coming off of the ammonia plant. 
The cost of producing green ammonia is 4 to 5x that of producing conventional ammonia. So in energy-starved regions like Europe, I think green ammonia has a real future -- in natural gas-rich, low-cost regions like North America, I think it's got some potential, but I think it's longer term because in the near term, I think blue is really going to dominate."

But UAN really should be trading at a pretty significant premium to urea on a per nitrogen unit equivalent basis. There's a lot more capital intensity around producing UAN and there's farmer efficiency and agronomic efficacy that favors UAN, particularly for certain types of crops. 
And therefore, the fact that it costs more to make and that the -- it's more valuable and easier to use, suggested ought to trade at a premium. The fact that for a while there, it was not trading in a premium, I think, is directly related to some of the unfair trade practices and dumping activity that was going on by subsidized producers in certain countries like Trinidad and Russia. 
And we're starting to see things get back to where they ought to be on a -- an economic basis. But I'd also say we have a fair bit of ability to move our production slate around in order to maximize margin opportunity depending upon where the different products are trading. So given where urea is trading today, versus where ammonia and UAN are trading today, we're going pretty much full on UAN and dramatically reducing our urea production. 
And in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if you see others in the world looking at that same math doing a similar kind of thing. So these things tend to even out over time, and it's not really the instantaneous spot price that matters. It's more the longer-term kind of relationship and benefits that they offer.

CF invested $5 billion from 2012 to 2017 on the new assets with the majority of that production of UAN in Donaldsonville and additional incremental capacity in Port Neal benefiting the North American farmer, and that supply has not been available due to the dumping and anticompetitive behavior of the Russian and Trinidadian supply. So that idle or available capacity is now being utilized to supply those needs. 
And so how has that moved our system around is we're much more active on the coasts. We've built tanks in California where we're now able to ship unit trains and almost looping those unit trains weekly and will take, I would say, a very healthy share of that supply to California to supply those needs. Same thing with the East Coast and our vessel that we had built and now contracted another vessel to move additional tonnage around to the East Coast all the way up into Canada. So how trade flows are moving are a direct reflection of a better position in a more even playing field, which we're now able to utilize our capacity. And so that is to supply the American farmers. So we've decreased exports. We've maintained -- even at a discount to the world price. The Europeans today are paying a higher price for UAN due to the high gas costs and high ammonia imports. And so products should be flowing that direction based on economics. So we will see how that flows. So we have prepared and we have adequately staffed. We have now 5,000 railcars in our service, as I already told you about with the vessels. So you'll see that reflected in Q1 and Q2 with additional supply to the United States."

And one of the interests of what's going on with the gas supply globally is this $20 gas to $25 gas in Europe is also the same structural cost for an Asian producer. 
And so you look at the Chinese gas importer, they're having to pay that. And India today is 50 -- I'd say 60% of their gas supply is LNG imports, paying that same type of price. So it's natural that you see in India tender and their run rates be below what I think a lot of people in the investment community have modeled requiring therefore, larger levels of imports. 
And so these things are constantly moving in a -- and for the first time in history, we've had a lack of supply as well as a high level of demand. That's what's driving global prices. And so those prices are attracting. India had paid the highest price in the world on their -- not this tender, but the previous one and a very acceptable price of around $600 a ton. Why? 
Because their production costs are so high and they have low inventory and they need that. That's a reflection of what's going on in the world. That's why we're so positive looking forward in the second half of -- with low inventories and moderating production capacities, we see good pricing going forward."

And therefore, although we expect them to return to be a supplier on the export stage. 
I don't think there's -- I'm not afraid of this boogie man out there that's going to come and dump access product into the global marketplace. And so what is really telling for us is the forward energy curves. Look, even if they compress from today's huge differentials to $10 in '23 and '24, that's still on a basis like $350 of margin differential for a North American producer per ton of ammonia. 
And those are energy spreads that this industry has never really seen over a prolonged period of time. So the fact that we're talking about 3 or 4 years of these huge margin opportunities for North American production is really a unique time in this industry."

And if you could just help frame what proportion of separately, ammonia, urea, UAN, seaborne product and global production actually is at the high end of the cost curve? Because I think there is some meaningful distinctions amongst the different products in terms of how much of the curve is actually buying that very expensive gas and just how we think about the differences in terms of the cost curve between the different products because certainly, the current ammonia, urea, UAN price are not telling all the same thing as it relates to cost curves today."

And I think you do see a relatively more consistent story in that regard. I think what you see with urea, particularly during a period of time where it's not going to ground in North America, is there's a tendency by certain rogue traders to want to try to manipulate the market and either build a position or take shorts or do other things. And so there's not a lot of volume transacting at what looks like a pretty discounted price relative to the other products. And certainly, we're not anxious to go out and book forward on those kind of prices because we don't think that really reflects the underlying value that nitrogen provides as you get into the growing season. 
And so I think the place to look at them really is more on global ammonia prices because remember, if you're making urea, you first got to make ammonia. And if you can make ammonia and sell it at a much higher margin structure as just ammonia, then you'll do that and pretty soon urea supply starts drying up pretty quick. So I mentioned this in response to a question earlier, which is I wouldn't fixate on the instantaneous price on these things, but really look at the broader kind of economics that underpin it. 
And Europe for a while had about 11 million tons of ammonia production off-line during the third and fourth quarter of last year because of very high energy prices. When you tighten up the market by that much, it's going to have a seismic impact across all products. So our view is, there is a very significant portion of the supply curve running at really high energy costs, and that's going to ultimately dominate where products should trade and the value of those products. And if there's some short-term discontinuities because of some sloppiness or some trading activity in urea that doesn't really tell the story. Ammonia is a much clearer picture."

And then even in Brazil for the second crop corn is profitable even at lower levels of yield. And so when you look at the cost curve dynamics on the production side as well as the demand side for the output, we have a very solid structural basis for the future like we've articulated."

However, you have to remember that production was lower in North America due to the hurricane and due to some turnarounds. And we project that inventories coming into the fertilizer year for June of '21 to July of '21 were also at historical lows. So the estimates today are around 1 million tons over that estimate or over the comparative basis from the year before. But as you add back or take out inventory and add and take out production, you're probably less than 0.5 million tons. 
Now you have to remember, the UAN or the urea market in the North America is roughly 15.5 million to 16 million tons. We import about 5.5 million tons. So we still have a significant amount of imports to make up. And those India tenders have basically soaked up the late or the available shippable capacity that might come to North America or might go to Brazil and Europe is behind and they need to order or put those vessels on the water to replace the production there.

I mean I think the important thing here is, by the time you decide to announce a project, it's probably 4 to 5 years until you're actually on stream. So what's less important about that decision is where today's prices are trading. What's more important is the longer-term S&D balance and what you believe is going to happen. As Chris mentioned earlier, we firmly believe that ammonia and hydrogen are going to play a critical role in decarbonizing economies and that demand is going to well exceed supply. 
The question is kind of when do you begin that build process. And right now, as Chris also said, the existing capacity trades at a discount to new construction. So as we think about it, you preserve the S&D balance, you get immediate cash flow, you're buying it at a relative discount if you can find existing assets that you like as opposed to build new. 
But the world is going to need more ammonia by the time you get to the back end of this decade. And I think those announcements are coming. But I think they're going to come in a different form from how they've happened in the past. In the past, there's been fertilizer plants that have been built. And I think what you're going to see is more clean energy ammonia plants being built, ones that are either purpose built around carbon capture and sequestration for blue ammonia production or possibly green production that you'll -- announcements like have happened in Australia and the Middle East and in Europe. 
And so -- and those tend not to be fertilizer plants, those tend to be more energy-oriented plants. And I think that's what we'll see more of. The cost point on those is substantially less than building in fully-integrated fertilizer complex. And so I think John, it's probably not too far in the future before you'll start seeing some real interest there. And you've already seen a raft of announcements around green projects. But I also think there's only a few places in the world where you really want to go build a blue plant and North America is one of them. We've got access to very plentiful low-cost natural gas. 
We have the right regulatory and legal framework, and we've got the regulations in place in order to facilitate carbon sequestration. And so I think this really is the ideal place for blue production to really develop and become a significant part of the clean energy source for the world."

Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, net cash from operations of $2.9 billion and a company-record free cash flow of nearly $2.2 billion. These",729,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, net cash from operations of $2.9 billion and a company-record free cash flow of nearly $2.2 billion. These results were made possible by the exceptional performance of the CF Industries team.
We managed through two severe weather events in North America, completed the highest level of maintenance activity in our company's history, navigated runaway gas costs in the UK and adeptly responded to a rapidly changing marketplace for our product. Consistent with our do-it-right culture, we did all of this safely. Our year-end recordable incident rate was 0.32 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, outstanding by any measure, but truly remarkable given the challenges of the year. 
Several of the factors that drove these terrific results in 2021 are expected to persist into the foreseeable future, namely strong demand, high-energy spread differentials and outstanding execution by our team. Let's start with the robust demand component. Significantly improving grain prices drove strong agricultural demand while economic recovery led to high industrial use as well.  
With December corn trading at $5.90 this year and $5.56 for next year, we see strong ag demand for at least the next 2 years. On the economy-driven industrial demand side, the last 2 years have seen inflation -- the last 2 months have seen inflation at 7% year-over-year, and that doesn't appear to be slowing down. So the combination of strong ag and industrial demand suggests overall global demand for nitrogen will continue at a torrid pace.  
Energy spread differentials between North America and high-cost Europe and Asia production exceeded $20 per MMBtu for most of the fourth quarter, which provided the opportunity for us to achieve record margins for our products. As we look forward, the energy spreads continue in the $18 to $20 range for the balance of this year and remain well above $10 for '23 and '24. Those energy differentials provide an extremely attractive environment for North American producers and give us a lot of confidence about our continuing cash generation potential. 
On top of this backdrop of very strong demand and high energy spreads were a set of factors that negatively impacted global supply in '21. Turnarounds and maintenance activity originally scheduled for 2020 was deferred into '21 because of the COVID pandemic and a desire to keep employees safe by limiting contractors coming on site. The catch-up in maintenance activities last year took an unusual amount of production out of the global supply. Two significant weather events in North America, Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida, further reduced production.  
The natural gas price spike in Europe and Asia, exceeding $30 per MMBtu for weeks at a time, caused plants to curtail or shut down in those regions, further reducing supply. And adding to these pressures, several important producing countries, in an effort to ensure nitrogen availability and affordability in their home markets, enacted export limitations or outright bans, including China, Russia, Egypt and Turkey. The result was significantly constrained supply at the exact time demand was surging, which led to the predictable outcome of rapidly increasing nitrogen prices. 
These dynamics came to a head in the second half of the year, and in particular, during the fourth quarter of '21 when global nitrogen prices reached record highs. This provided the market opportunity for the company to deliver an all-time record quarter, both in terms of EBITDA and free cash flow. This enabled us to return $800 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We paid $500 million of long-term debt and return to investment-grade credit ratings, while adding roughly $1 billion of cash to the balance sheet. 
As I said earlier, we believe the market dynamics of last year have plenty of runway ahead. To this environment, we bring unique capabilities honed over the past decade. Our investments in people, safety and growth have built the industry's highest-performing manufacturing network, as shown on Slide 6 of our materials. Slide under -- Slide 10 underscores how this advantage is amplified by the low-cost position that North American natural gas provides us. As a result, we are able to capture the significant margin opportunities in front of us. 
Now let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Bert?"

Global nitrogen demand remains robust, u",381,"Thanks, Tony. We believe industry fundamentals point to a continued tight global nitrogen supply and demand balance and an extended period of positive operating conditions for low-cost producers like CF Industries. Global nitrogen demand remains robust, underpinned by the need to replenish global grain stocks. As you can see on Slide 9, global coarse grain stocks-to-use ratios remained low, supporting high crop prices and another strong year for farm incomes.  
High demand for coarse grains leads to high demand for our products as farmers are incentivized to apply fertilizer to maximize yield. This helped drive our strongest fall ammonia application season since 2012, and our expectations for a high level of coarse grains planting this year, we project that 91 million to 93 million of acres of corn will be planted in the United States, along with strong wheat, cotton and canola plantings across North America.  
We believe it will take at least two more growing seasons that trend yields to fully replenish global stocks, supporting continued strong agricultural demand. At the same time, increased economic activity is driving industrial demand for ammonia, urea and diesel exhaust fluid. We had record DES sales volumes in 2021 and expect continued growth for this important emissions control product.  
Against this demand outlook, we believe global nitrogen inventory today is low. This reflects the impact of both strong demand and lower global production in 2021. Looking ahead, we expect global supply to remain challenged by high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia, along with coal costs and tightening environmental regulations in China. This should continue to affect the profitability of producers in these areas and lead to lower operating rates. Additionally, natural gas forward curves suggest continued favorable energy spreads for North American producers compared to marginal producers in Europe, as you can see on Slide 10. 
We are well positioned for the spring fertilizer application season ahead. We are pleased with our order book, which we began to build at peak prices in the fourth quarter. Our manufacturing network is operating at a high level, and we look forward to leveraging our logistics and distribution capabilities to meet demand as fertilizer applications and planting begins in North America in a few weeks.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $917 million or $4.24 per diluted share. EBITDA was approximately $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA was just over $2.7 billion. Net earnings and EBITDA reflect pretax noncash impairment charges of $521 million related to our U.K. operations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2021, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $705 million and EBITDA was $1.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.26 billion. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in the quarter were both company records. These financial results allowed us to opportunistically accelerate capital return to shareholders at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $490 million, effectively completing the $1 billion share repurchase program that expired at the end of 2021. Since 2019, we have repurchased nearly 19 million shares. We continue to view share repurchases as an important tool for return on and return of capital. 
As you can see on Slides 13 and 14, over the last decade, we have invested in the business to grow free cash flow, while at the same time, lowering the outstanding share count. As a result, shareholders have accrued more of the asset base, doubling their free cash flow participation on a per share basis compared to our prior free cash flow record back in 2011. We believe our new $1.5 billion share repurchase program provides us a strong platform to build on this performance. 
At the same time, we remain focused on disciplined investments in clean energy that offer returns above our cost of capital. We have begun construction on the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville with completion expected in 2023. This year, we'll begin work on the installation of dehydration and compression equipment at Donaldsonville to enable production of blue ammonia. We believe these projects are well-timed to accelerate the growth of a global market for blue and green ammonia. We also continue to have productive discussions with leading companies who share our belief in ammonia's clean energy attributes and its role in decarbonizing economies around the world.  
Our estimated CapEx spending for 2022 of $500 million to $550 million includes expenditures for the Donaldsonville blue and green ammonia projects. And through 2025, we have committed $385 million in capital to these projects in installation of dehydration and compression equipment at Yazoo City. We also remain committed to reducing the gross debt on the company from $3.5 billion to $3 billion by the middle of 2023.  
We start 2022 with a strong balance sheet, positive multiyear industry outlook and stable maintenance CapEx plans for the next few years. We also expect gross ammonia production in the years ahead to return to typical levels of 9.5 million to 10 million tons, supporting higher sales volumes compared to 2021. As a result, we expect to have significant excess free cash flow to deploy in the years ahead.  
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

We're licensing the intellectual property and the design from our IP providers to do that. We are going with a conventional alkaline-water approach because it's been proven and tested and has good reliability record. But the cost of green ammonia remains, particularly in North America where we've got access to low-cost gas and have options for sequestering the CO2 coming off of the ammonia plant.  
The cost of producing green ammonia is 4 to 5x that of producing conventional ammonia. So in energy-starved regions like Europe, I think green ammonia has a real future -- in natural gas-rich, low-cost regions like North America, I think it's got some potential, but I think it's longer term because in the near term, I think blue is really going to dominate."

Now when you look at that from a -- I'm going to take it back to a farmer basis or to a retail basis, that inventories being built in the interior at those tranche levels. So some of the discussion that's going on in the farm centers around cost, they're taking the absolute peak cost of that UAN and not the blended cost that the retailer is sitting on that's available to the farmer at very attractive levels at $6.40 bought corn or $6 forward corn.  
Ammonia, we sold -- we began selling at around $600 and ended up selling probably at the peak of some incremental volume at $1,200. And so you saw the blended cost there. urea, I think our average price for the quarter was $650, and that was built in Q3 and then early into Q4. So the majority of urea that we booked will be shipping out in Q1 at very attractive prices. So you've seen that built over time. Q2 ammonia has been sold at that $1,200 to $1,400 level.

You don't have to go back that far. You could probably go back just a couple of days and see how we move even when the fundamentals are extremely strong. So we think there'll be opportunities through the year, Steve, where we can make maybe some larger share repurchases.

So not much there were -- our expectation is we will have a substantial amount to deploy. Related to the growth side, as always, we continue to look at assets that are available and what -- where they're trading versus building new assets.

But UAN really should be trading at a pretty significant premium to urea on a per nitrogen unit equivalent basis. There's a lot more capital intensity around producing UAN and there's farmer efficiency and agronomic efficacy that favors UAN, particularly for certain types of crops.  
And therefore, the fact that it costs more to make and that the -- it's more valuable and easier to use, suggested ought to trade at a premium. The fact that for a while there, it was not trading in a premium, I think, is directly related to some of the unfair trade practices and dumping activity that was going on by subsidized producers in certain countries like Trinidad and Russia.  
And we're starting to see things get back to where they ought to be on an economic basis. But I'd also say we have a fair bit of ability to move our production slate around in order to maximize margin opportunity depending upon where the different products are trading. So given where urea is trading today, versus where ammonia and UAN are trading today, we're going pretty much full on UAN and dramatically reducing our urea production.  
And in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if you see others in the world looking at that same math doing a similar kind of thing. So these things tend to even out over time, and it's not really the instantaneous spot price that matters. It's more the longer-term kind of relationship and benefits that they offer.

CF invested $5 billion from 2012 to 2017 on the new assets with the majority of that production of UAN in Donaldsonville and additional incremental capacity in Port Neal benefiting the North American farmer, and that supply has not been available due to the dumping and anticompetitive behavior of the Russian and Trinidadian supply. So that idle or available capacity is now being utilized to supply those needs.  
And so how has that moved our system around is we're much more active on the coasts. We've built tanks in California, where we're now able to ship unit trains, and almost looping those unit trains weekly. And we'll take, I would say, a very healthy share of that supply to California to supply those needs. Same thing with the East Coast and our vessel that we had built and now we've contracted another vessel to move additional tonnage around to the East Coast all the way up into Canada.
So how trade flows are moving are a direct reflection of a better position and a more even plain field, which we're now able to utilize our capacity. And so that is to supply the American farmer. So we've decreased exports, we've maintained even a little discount to the world price. The Europeans, today, are paying a higher price for UAN due to the high gas costs and high ammonia imports. And so our product should be flowing in that direction based on economics. We will see how that flows. 
But -- so we have prepared and we have adequately staffed. We have now 5,000 railcars in our service, as I already told you about, through the vessels. So you'll see that reflected in Q1 and Q2 of additional supply to the United States."

And one of the interests of what's going on with the gas supply globally is this $20 gas to $25 gas in Europe is also the same structural cost for an Asian producer. 
And so you look at the Chinese gas importer, they're having to pay that. And India today is 50 -- I'd say 60% of their gas supply is LNG imports, paying that same type of price. So it's natural that you see in India tender and their run rates be below what I think a lot of people in the investment community have modeled requiring therefore, larger levels of imports. 
And so these things are constantly moving in a -- and for the first time in history, we've had a lack of supply as well as a high level of demand. That's what's driving global prices. And so those prices are attracting. India had paid the highest price in the world on their -- not this tender, but the previous one and a very acceptable price of around $600 a ton. 
Why? Because their production costs are so high and they have low inventory and they need that. That's a reflection of what's going on in the world. That's why we're so positive looking forward in the second half of -- with low inventories and moderating production capacities, we see good pricing going forward."

And therefore, although we expect them to return to be a supplier on the export stage. 
I don't think there's -- I'm not afraid of this boogie man out there that's going to come and dump access product into the global marketplace. And so what is really telling for us is the forward energy curves. Look, even if they compress from today's huge differentials to $10 in '23 and '24, that's still on a basis like $350 of margin differential for a North American producer per ton of ammonia. 
And those are energy spreads that this industry has never really seen over a prolonged period of time. So the fact that we're talking about 3 or 4 years of these huge margin opportunities for North American production is really a unique time in this industry."

And if you could just help frame what proportion of separately, ammonia, urea, UAN, seaborne product and global production actually is at the high end of the cost curve? 
Because I think there is some meaningful distinctions amongst the different products in terms of how much of the curve is actually buying that very expensive gas and just how we think about the differences in terms of the cost curve between the different products because certainly, the current ammonia, urea, UAN price are not telling all the same thing as it relates to cost curves today."

And I think you do see a relatively more consistent story in that regard. I think what you see with urea, particularly during a period of time where it's not going to ground in North America, is there's a tendency by certain rogue traders to want to try to manipulate the market and either build a position or take shorts or do other things. And so there's not a lot of volume transacting at what looks like a pretty discounted price relative to the other products. And certainly, we're not anxious to go out and book forward on those kind of prices because we don't think that really reflects the underlying value that nitrogen provides as you get into the growing season. 
And so I think the place to look at them really is more on global ammonia prices because remember, if you're making urea, you first got to make ammonia. And if you can make ammonia and sell it at a much higher margin structure as just ammonia, then you'll do that and pretty soon urea supply starts drying up pretty quick. So I mentioned this in response to a question earlier, which is I wouldn't fixate on the instantaneous price on these things, but really look at the broader kind of economics that underpin it. 
And Europe for a while had about 11 million tons of ammonia production off-line during the third and fourth quarter of last year because of very high energy prices. When you tighten up the market by that much, it's going to have a seismic impact across all products. So our view is, there is a very significant portion of the supply curve running at really high energy costs, and that's going to ultimately dominate where products should trade and the value of those products. And if there's some short-term discontinuities because of some sloppiness or some trading activity in urea that doesn't really tell the story. Ammonia is a much clearer picture."

And when you look at the subsidized markets, subsidize on the outputs of Europe and India, it's an amazing opportunity because the farmers are still going to make money at these prices. When you look at a market like the United States, that has subsidies of crop insurance, but the prices today relative to total inputs is going to be the second best year of profitability in the last 10 years. 
And then even in Brazil for the second crop corn is profitable even at lower levels of yield. And so when you look at the cost curve dynamics on the production side as well as the demand side for the output, we have a very solid structural basis for the future like we've articulated."

When you think about cost of vessel freight and demurrage and supply chain costs continue to go up for us to keep a lot of that production domestic and focus on the products that are not as manipulated as urea is."

Well, 4 weeks later, here we are announcing a press release that we completely missed it, and we were off by like 25%. So that's why we don't give guidance because the pricing environment is so volatile that within the span of 4 weeks, we got it really wrong. Suffice it to say that 2021 was a fantastic year for us.

We expect at the end of Q2 or beginning of Q3, I don't have the exact date. And so the basis of those findings, though is that they were dumping, they were anticompetitive. We won, all good. And so yes, there are different levels for different companies. And I would take it to a generalization of there roughly 1 million tons of Russian imports into the United States and 1 million tons of Trinidadian imports into the United States. And UAN supply and demand, demand is roughly, I would say, for North America, so you have some Canadian production, 16 million tons. 
And so of those imports, you extract that out. And the United States, like I said earlier, we have the latent capacity, we're able to replace those. And so what we expect to happen is through this case, that some of those tons will be redirected to other markets and whether that be South America or Europe, and that the United States will be fully supplied by North American production."

However, you have to remember that production was lower in North America due to the hurricane and due to some turnarounds. And we project that inventories coming into the fertilizer year for June of '21 to July of '21 were also at historical lows. So the estimates today are around 1 million tons over that estimate or over the comparative basis from the year before. But as you add back or take out inventory and add and take out production, you're probably less than 0.5 million tons. 
Now you have to remember, the UAN or the urea market in the North America is roughly 15.5 million to 16 million tons. We import about 5.5 million tons. So we still have a significant amount of imports to make up. And those India tenders have basically soaked up the late or the available shippable capacity that might come to North America or might go to Brazil and Europe is behind and they need to order or put those vessels on the water to replace the production there. 
So we see a fairly positive environment going forward, not only for North America but for the world based on those dynamics."

And the nutrient tons goes back to the ammonia production to begin with. 
So as you said, Michael, we're looking at kind of 9.5 to 10 million ammonia tons. The 10 is probably a little bit on the outside range just because our Ince plant in the U.K. continues to be down right now. And so 10 is probably a stretch, but somewhere in that range is very likely. And then Bert is going to manage the product upgrade slate in order to maximize netbacks for us. 
And that typically has gone anywhere from kind of 19.5 million to 20 million tons and maybe a few more here and there. As you said, low inventories coming into the year.

So what's less important about that decision is where today's prices are trading. What's more important is the longer-term S&D balance and what you believe is going to happen. As Chris mentioned earlier, we firmly believe that ammonia and hydrogen are going to play a critical role in decarbonizing economies and that demand is going to well exceed supply. 
The question is kind of when do you begin that build process. And right now, as Chris also said, the existing capacity trades at a discount to new construction. So as we think about it, you preserve the S&D balance, you get immediate cash flow, you're buying it at a relative discount if you can find existing assets that you like as opposed to build new. 
But the world is going to need more ammonia by the time you get to the back end of this decade. And I think those announcements are coming. But I think they're going to come in a different form from how they've happened in the past. In the past, there's been fertilizer plants that have been built. And I think what you're going to see is more clean energy ammonia plants being built, ones that are either purpose built around carbon capture and sequestration for blue ammonia production or possibly green production that you'll -- announcements like have happened in Australia and the Middle East and in Europe. 
And so -- and those tend not to be fertilizer plants, those tend to be more energy-oriented plants. And I think that's what we'll see more of. The cost point on those is substantially less than building in fully-integrated fertilizer complex. And so I think John, it's probably not too far in the future before you'll start seeing some real interest there. And you've already seen a raft of announcements around green projects. But I also think there's only a few places in the world where you really want to go build a blue plant and North America is one of them. We've got access to very plentiful low-cost natural gas. 
We have the right regulatory and legal framework, and we've got the regulations in place in order to facilitate carbon sequestration. And so I think this really is the ideal place for blue production to really develop and become a significant part of the clean energy source for the world."

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2022, in which we generated a quarterly record adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 billion. Our trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $3.7 billion, and free cash flow was $2.8 billion. These results reflect continuing outstanding performance by the CF Industries team against the backdrop of a very tight global nitrogen supply demand balance and wide energy spreads between North America and marginal production in Europe. 
We ran our assets extremely well. Our North American manufacturing plant set first quarter production records for gross ammonia, UAN and diesel exhaust fluid. We leveraged our extensive distribution network to serve customers in the corn belt and expanded our logistics capacity to serve customers on the East and West Coasts. Most importantly, we did this safely. 
Our trailing 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.25 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. This level of exceptional execution will continue to serve our customers and shareholders well as we expect the global nitrogen supply demand balance to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Nitrogen demand will continue to be underpinned by the world's need to replenish global grain stocks. We believe it will take at least 2 years and possibly longer to accomplish this. 
At the same time, high energy costs in Europe and Asia are likely to lower global operating rates at certain times of the year. So we expect nitrogen supply to remain tight with the marginal time being very high cost. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated both demand and supply situations. First, by impairing Ukraine's grain production and exports;  and second, by creating uncertainty about natural gas price and availability in Europe. Taken together, these factors make it likely that global nitrogen supply demand balance will stay tighter for longer. 
Given these market dynamics, coupled with our position on the low end of the cost curve, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the coming years. This will enable us to invest in our clean energy growth initiatives while also returning substantial cash to shareholders. We are excited about growth opportunities we see in the clean energy applications of ammonia. 
Earlier this week, we announced in conjunction with Mitsui, a potential new blue ammonia facility in North America. We also continue to advance both our green and blue ammonia projects at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana facility. We expect to begin making green hydrogen and green ammonia in 2023 and have up to 1.7 million tons of blue ammonia production beginning in 2024. These are important steps forward in the development of this exciting new market opportunity, one where we are clearly leading the way. 
In a moment, Chris will provide more details on our approach to capital allocation moving forward, including our capital expenditure outlook and our return of capital program. But first, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Bert?"

[ Farm returns ] in North America for all crops are forecast to be historically high despite higher input costs, setting the stage for another strong year of farm incomes. This includes farmers who will be growing corn, wheat, cotton and rice. 
As you can see on Slide 9, global coarse grain stocks-to-use ratios have not improved over the last 6 months, driving nitrogen-consuming crop prices toward record highs. The time line to replenish grain stock has been getting longer, not shorter. We believe it will take at least 2 more years and trend yields to fully replenish global stocks, supporting continued strong agricultural-led demand for nitrogen. We continue to expect healthy planted acres of nitrogen-consuming crops this year. Looking at new crop futures, returns for corn exceed those of soybeans, which supports our projection of 91 million to 93 million acres of corn planted in the United States in 2022 if weather cooperates. 
During the first quarter, our team leveraged the flexibility of our network to ensure that we were able to serve customers by helping prepare for this coming demand. Our rail utilization was at its highest level in years, and we increased UAN large capacity. We also chartered 3x our typical volume of U.S. flagged Jones Act vessels to move UAN efficiently to the East and West Coasts. Rail service to some of our customers has become a serious issue in the second quarter, and we continue to work through those challenges. 
We believe that high crop prices and strong farm income will also drive demand for nitrogen in the world's largest urea export destinations. We expect the recent urea tender by India to be the first in a regular cadence of tender activity in the coming months. We also project urea consumption in Brazil to remain strong in 2022. We do not see many catalysts in the near term to significantly increase global nitrogen supply availability. We expect China to resume urea exports in the second half of the year. However, it is unclear how large the volumes will be given the Chinese government's focus on keeping food inflation under control and balancing the environmental impact of coal-based urea production. 
Marginal production in Europe that cannot export to the Southern Hemisphere will face difficult operating decisions during the Northern Hemisphere off-season if natural gas costs continue to be high. We expect Russian fertilizer producers to continue to export but at reduced rate due to sanctions, limited internal logistics and port outlets, difficulty arranging insurance and vessel shipping. 
CF Industries remained well positioned in this environment, even as natural gas costs in North America have increased. Natural gas forward curve suggests continued favorable energy spreads for North American producers compared to marginal production in Europe as you can see on Slide 12. We continue to work with customers on their requirements for the spring fertilizer application season as weather has largely delayed planting so far. 
Farmers have proven that they are able to plant their acres in a short amount of time once that weather window opens. While most customers are prepared for first applications, we will leverage our expertise and extend the distribution network to meet the [indiscernible] demand that will emerge after planting. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,1771540124,2554563,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 05, 2022",2022-05-05,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert. For the first quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $883 million or $4.21 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.68 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.65 billion. The trailing 12-month net cash f",513,"Thanks, Bert. For the first quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $883 million or $4.21 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.68 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.65 billion. The trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.8 billion. 
Given the substantial free cash flow we are generating today and our confidence in the company's long-term free cash flow outlook, I want to walk you through our expectations for capital allocation moving forward. First, we reached our long-term gross debt target of $3 billion in April after we repaid the final $500 million of our 2023 notes. This level of debt and the work we've done over the years on lowering fixed charges provides us with financial flexibility now and through the cycle. 
We expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $500 million to $550 million per year. This estimate includes planned maintenance activity as well as our investments in clean energy initiatives that are in progress. We continue to advance the Green Ammonia project at Donaldsonville Complex and have placed orders for all major equipment. The construction of the CO2 compression and dehydration facility at Donaldsonville is expected to be complete in 2024, enabling us to be first to market with the significant volume of blue ammonia once sequestration is initiated. 
While we leveraged our existing network to create decarbonized ammonia capacity, we're excited to pursue organic growth in blue ammonia capacity through a joint venture with Mitsui. We believe the investment related to this effort in the next 2 years will be measured with a FEED study beginning shortly and FID in 2023. The nearly 50-50 joint venture will support our ongoing commitment to disciplined investments in the emerging clean energy market and provide supply of low-carbon ammonia to support the global transition of clean energy. 
Given these relatively modest calls on capital, we expect to have ample capital to return to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchases. The Board's decision to increase the dividend by 33% was driven by 2 main factors: the more positive outlook for cash generation across the cycle and the significant reduction in fixed charges we have achieved through debt reduction, share repurchases and other initiatives to eliminate frictional costs in the business. 
We also continue to view share repurchases as an important way to provide shareholders a return on and return of capital. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 million. This represented the ratable portion of our share repurchase program for the quarter. Based on our free cash flow generation outlook, we expect to increase the ratable portion of our share repurchase program to $175 million per quarter. Along with the higher quarterly dividend, this positions us to return greater than $1 billion to shareholders on an annualized basis. 
We are also prepared to opportunistically repurchase additional shares at attractive levels as we have in the past. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize the entire team here at CF Industries for their outstanding work during the quarter. Our focus continues to be on operating safely and leveraging our manufacturing and distribution network to serve customers, a role that is even more critically important today than ever. The North American agriculture sector, including CF Industries, is poised for strong results over the next several years as we collectively work to replenish global grain stocks. 
The geopolitical issues in Europe, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine only increases the importance of the role North American farmers play as well as the rest of the supply chain in providing food for the world. The last year has underscored the critically important role of ammonia to the world both for fertilizer and industrial applications. It has also confirmed our belief that new demand for ammonia in clean energy applications will grow significantly in the coming years. 
CF Industries will be a leader in supplying blue and green ammonia to meet this emerging demand, and we are excited about our progress in this area. We have tremendous opportunities before us and we intend to capitalize on them to create meaningful shareholder value in both the near and longer term. 
With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

And I think the combination of having a geographically separate location to produce blue ammonia combined with the blue and green ammonia project at Donaldsonville give us some continuity of supply regardless of weather events like that. 
such that we can enter into very reliable, long-term supply agreements for production of low and 0 carbon ammonia with counterparties. And that's really the reason why that put it at a different location than D'ville. In terms of why blue ammonia as opposed to a full-blown fertilizer plant with upgrades and everything, it really speaks to both ours as well as Mitsui's conviction that this is an area of not only emerging demand but very strong demand as we get out into the future. 
And so we believe the world is going to need this. We think that, particularly given that the U.S. does not have a structured regulatory cost of carbon today, but most of the rest of the world or much of the rest of the world does, that an export-oriented facility where we can move those tons into the international marketplace and really leverage the skill set and capabilities that Mitsui brings as a partner is critically important and will serve us really well. 
And I think from an overall kind of, you had mentioned economics or capital. The reason we're going through the FEED stage is to really get a much better handle on what the cost of the project is going to be. But just based on our recent experience, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, adjusting for inflation that's taking place, it wouldn't surprise me if we -- for a greenfield facility, we're in the neighborhood of $2 billion plus or minus for this. 
But remember, it's basically a 50-50 investment for both of us. And it's paced out over 5 years. So think about that from our perspective as even though the money doesn't go out the door ratably like that, but you're talking about $200 million a year in terms of capital over the next 5 years. That's a relatively -- I mean, it's a significant amount of money. 
But given the fact that we generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow in the last 12 months, it's imminently affordable and not a crazy amount, and I feel really good about the prospects for that plant having a fantastic return profile for shareholders."

It's the process waste stream that comes from ammonia production using a steam methane reformer. And so we've already captured that. 
In some instances, we use that CO2 for urea production and others, we end up venting the excess CO2 that we don't need. But the most capital intensive and costly aspect of CO2 sequestration is the capturing of CO2 to begin with. And because that's already baked into how an ammonia plant operates, the incremental cost that we're looking at is really just the dehydration and compression of the CO2 stream so that it's suitable for injection into geological sequestration wells. 
And so for us, as we announced at Donaldsonville, we're looking at roughly $200 million for dehydration and compression and it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of $5 to $10 per ton of CO2 of incremental utility costs down there. And then there's going to be some transport and some injection costs as well. But that still leaves plenty of money available within the current framework of the 45Q tax credit to earn a very favorable return on the incremental capital that we need to put in place, which is only $200 million. 
And for a greenfield facility or a brand-new facility, it's basically the same plant, whether you're doing conventional or blue we're just adding the additional dehydration compression. So again, call it another roughly $200 million. And again, on that kind of basis, the 45Q tax credit provides a very attractive return profile for us. 
So that's why ammonia production is pretty unique in the industrial landscape in terms of most likely able to take advantage of the 45Q credit. I think if you were doing flue gas capture or other things, you're talking about probably $120 to $150 a ton that you need the credit to get to in order to justify it based on today's technologies. 
Now I do think that there will likely be ongoing improvements and developments to reduce the capital and operating costs going forward on flue gas. But where we are today, you need a much higher 45Q tax credit. Fortunately, we're not encumbered by that given that we already capture so much CO2."

And there was an announcement today or information in the trade publications about a continued enforcement of those export bans possibly through or into 2023. 
So it's not clear how many tons will come out, when they'll come out. The previous position was in June that the export ban will be lifted. And so what we have seen is a very tight control of product, both [ NP ] coming out of China. And China represents about 10% of the global trade, so a significant portion taken off the market. 
What we've seen internally to China is the price is controlled, almost half of what has been traded on the international market. So again, a reflection of controlling costs to the farmers and keeping that product in China. So we've been open that economically and from incentives as a marginal producer that they should be exporting on, again, on an economic basis. But on a governmental action basis, that probably will not happen. So let's just say we had probably expected 3 million to 4 million tons. It could be half or less than that, looking at it today."

And as Bert mentioned, some of the outlook that we see, that will be even greater. So I think it provides us a lot of opportunities to do a lot of different things. One is to do the growth plans that we talked about here.

And so as Chris said, even if we're ultimately decided to move forward on this new blue ammonia project, it adds roughly, as I said, kind of $200 million plus or minus per year to a range that's $500 to $550 million of capital per year. We don't really have additional debt reduction, so call it, $700 million to $750 million of capital going out the door that we've earmarked already.

But I think one of the things that we're seeing is a return to appropriate valuation for UAN, where it belongs compared to urea. It is a more costly product to make than urea given that there's significantly more capital involved in the production process. It also offers farmers a tremendous product with great efficacy from an agronomic standpoint but also gives them some efficiencies in terms of application of other chemicals, whether it's fungicides or herbicides or insecticides or whatever can be mixed in with the UAN. 
And so it provides benefits to the grower, it's higher cost to the producer.  Therefore, auto trade, generally speaking, at a premium to urea on a per unit of nitrogen basis. And that's where it is, again, and I think largely because of the fact that the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission put in the duties on product that was being dumped illegally by the Russians and the Trinidadians. And so our expectation, and I think generally speaking, as UAN should trade at this level premium to urea. In terms of kind of our plans going forward, I'll turn it over to Bert."

And we have benefited or moved to a higher production and remain that way through first quarter of favoring UAN over urea. And as long as that spread maintains, we will continue to do that. 
The outlook is favorable. The demand is there with 91 million to 93 million acres of corn and what is taking place with restrictions of feed grains coming out of Russia and Ukraine, the world where we rely on Argentina, Brazil and the United States and to a lesser degree, India and Australia to supply the wheat and some of the corn out of South America, especially. And that will take a lot of nitrogen. And we're seeing growth in UAN in those markets and continued demand in North America. Europe is constrained. With the gas spreads taking place today at $30 TTF against $7 to $8 in North America, it is difficult to produce and participate in the global market from Europe as they have in the past. So we expect trade flows to change, especially as a result of Russia and then UAN from the United States to possibly go what's most urgently needed in a food-constrained world."

And you're right, logistical issues have been front and center when we went public a week or so ago with some of the delays from the Union Pacific and some other rail carriers. We have been working with our rail providers to have good solutions in place, whether that be service and railcars and that is a work in progress today. 
And so we've been communicating with our customers on any potential delays or movements. But because of that, we've geared up with additional UAN large capacity as well as I mentioned in my prepared remarks vessels to go to the East and West Coast to just expand our capability to fully supply North America with needed UAN, and we've ramped up production, as we talked about in previous quarters. What I think is taking place then it gets to the delays because of weather.  And we've had cool wet weather, which has delayed access to the fields, and that impacts ammonia. 
And so the conversations with customers today are very real of do you have enough in place? And if you're asking us to move it, don't rely necessarily on the railroads today, but what we can do with our distribution network. And I do think ammonia will be challenged. We still have a good portion of our ammonia to be applied to the ground. But I think you're going to quickly go to putting the seed in the ground, especially as we get closer to the middle of May and potential yield impacts of late planting. 
So yes, we have sufficient storage. Yes, we have sufficient product. We are running our plants at 100% capacity and working very long hours to make sure that we supply our customers with the nitrogen nutrients that they need."

And you asked -- you're asking the question that we've all been trying to answer and have been doing a lot of work globally to put that quantitatively together to make decisions on movements of products and expectations for the forward curves. And when you look at what's taking place with restrictions out of the Black Sea on grains and oilseeds and even processed products, the world needs to increase the rest of the world's production and ability to ship, and that needs to happen in the Northern Hemisphere in the spring. 
And I think that's going to be constrained in Europe just with some limits on nutrients. I think we're fully supplied in North America and having good weather would be very helpful to a bountiful crop. And then it moves to South America, who plants in September, October, November, December, January for second crop and then the harvest thereafter. So it's -- to us, it's a 2023 issue.  When these potential shortages can materialize, and it could be constrained because of lack of nutrients. 
With what's going on with restrictions or sanctions out of Belarus and Russia, and then you factor in 100% limitation because of the war out of Ukraine and then shipments out of the Black Sea and then governmental restrictions from China, you've taken out of urea, 25% of the urea supply. So you then need to move things around, maybe use more ammonium sulfate to different applications and [ price ] probably will have to impact some of that. I do think some of your third world countries that are planting non-dollar-denominated exportable products probably will have yield impacts that will require food imports. 
That's still to happen. And so these are things that we are watching, paying very close attention to and talking to our industry partners, whether that be grain companies, processing companies as well as distribution companies to make sure we're at the forefront of supplying the nutrients that we're capable of supplying on time and with a reasonable cost."

And that's why our view is that those assets will be running more intermittently, and you'll see lower operating rates as a result of it, which ends up making the supply-demand situation globally tight on an ongoing basis and even when it runs pretty high cost marginal tons that are coming out of Europe. 
And the spread of -- even if the spread collapses down to $10 between North America and Europe, $10 x 34 MMBtus per ton of ammonia x 10 million tons of ammonia. You're talking about $3.4 billion just an ammonia value for us before you even get into the upgrades and the value of the logistics network. 
And that's only on a $10 spread. On a $20 spread obviously it's twice that. So the kind of energy curves that we're looking at going forward give us a lot of confidence about the cash generation of this business. And our U.K. assets are pretty de minimis in terms of the contribution they make to the overall profitability of the enterprise as well as the ammonia production volume. It's really North America that carries the freight in terms of what drives this company. 
So we are okay running our European business, our U.K. business and assets when it's profitable to do so. And we're also okay taking those plants off-line when it's not profitable to do so. And so our view is we want to be, generally speaking, more daily buyers of gas in Europe, given where they sit on the cost curve and not try to take a long position on gas hedging there because we think those plants ought to cycle on and cycle off given where they sit in the global cost curve."

We are students of the market globally, just like we are with fertilizers, the key component of our cost. And it behooves us to be watching that diligently and buying and positioning ourselves appropriately. 
And today, as Tony said, that spread from North America to Europe is over $20, but even on the $23, $24 forward curve, it still is $20. So that's why you're going to see European production continue to be constrained and especially in the absence of Russian gas as we approach winter this coming fall and winter, I think it's going to be very challenged. 
Your question about Russian shipments, yes, we are tracking what's being loaded and where it's being loaded. And I think the -- there are several limitations. And as you take away the logistical capabilities and movements and flexibility of the Russian producers coming out of whether that be Siberia in the perm area or where they're loading internally to move to the external market, there's a tremendous change that has taken place due to the invasion and that's the limit of ports. So you had Black Sea ports Mykolaiv, Odesa and others that have been load ports, but that product has to get through there. Those are no longer available. Same thing with ports that have been like in Riga and other places in the north, they're not Russian owned or accessed. 
And so when you take the port capabilities down to probably 30% of the available outlets that then has a backup process of logistics, a backup process of storage and an inability to consistently move nitrogen phosphate and potash out as they did before. That will become more material as we move forward. 
Then you layer on, on top of that insurance costs and vessel inability to get vessels or vessels not desiring to load in those ports and thereby pushing pricing up. Today, it's -- I think, like a St. Pete to Brazil is close to $200 a ton that was less than $50 just a few months ago. 
And so these issues will continue to constrain Russian production on top of sanctions as we roll forward and if the sanctions do continue to be applied through 2022 and forward."

You're going to generate so much free cash in the next bunch of years that people have seen in this call already. And this is -- this might be the best you're ever going to have. I mean you just said in your other project that you have so much cash on the balance sheet is going to build here. Why not in this peak year or I don't want to say peak but this is good as a guess here, let's say, why not be a little more aggressive on the buyback?

I mean I think there's a lot of runway left and a lot of uncertainty out there. And the longer you see these kind of energy spreads and the longer you've got, which obviously is a tragic, terrible situation with conflict. But the longer that persists, the more it pressures both the demand side because of grain availability as well as the supply side in terms of gas cost and availability. And so I would hesitate to call the -- this is a 1-year situation. 
I think it puts us in a very enviable position. And as Chris said, we are focused on a ratable basis now between the dividend and the ratable portion of the share repurchase program, returning over $1 billion a year to shareholders. And that still gives us a lot of capacity to go in strong when we see drops in the share price and discontinuities like that. 
When a couple of weeks ago, there was a rumor of ceasefire, we dropped $15 in 1 day, and then we ended up catching some of that back through the course of the day. But we have a highly volatile stock, and we want to be able to absolutely capitalize when there is drops in the share price that are not connected to the fundamentals of the financial performance of the business. 
And our belief is that, that is actually going to be in the best interest of our shareholders. And if that means we carry a little bit of extra cash on the balance sheet from time to time, so be it. I think when they see us like we did in the fourth quarter, taking out as many shares as we did at the average price of $60-some, that's a pretty attractive move. And so the fact that we can continue to do that and return a big chunk of cash on a ratable basis just again proves, I think, the value of this organization and company and the asset base that we've got here."

And those are things that Bert and Tony have been talking about for over the past year. So we've seen a fundamental shift in what our outlook is on that and seeing that for a longer bit of time than maybe even what we saw a year ago. 
But then additionally, I think it's all the work we've done on our fixed charges over time. The mantra we've had over the last 3 years is really to reduce our fixed charges both through not only the debt reduction but even the share repurchase where we had lower amount of aggregate dollars going out for dividends. And then additionally, the work that Ashraf and his team have done through manufacturing to get our controllable costs down. So when you work all those things together, I think it's allowed us to increase the dividend without really changing our fixed charge outlook all that greatly. 
And then that, coupled with where we see the nitrogen market fundamentally shifting to made us feel very comfortable in  and I think the Board is well with their approval of it."

And so while I'm not forecasting another increase, it wouldn't surprise me if longer term based on the factors that Chris said, both lower fixed charges as well as better industry fundamentals, and a high share price, meaning a low dividend yield, that you wouldn't see it go up again at some point. So we're very bullish looking forward.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2022, in which we generated a quarterly record adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 billion. Our trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $3.7 billion, and free cash flow was $2.8 billion.
These results reflect continuing outstanding performance by the CF Industries team against the backdrop of a very tight global nitrogen supply demand balance and wide energy spreads between North America and marginal production in Europe.
We ran our assets extremely well. Our North American manufacturing plant set first quarter production records for gross ammonia, UAN and diesel exhaust fluid. We leveraged our extensive distribution network to serve customers in the corn belt and expanded our logistics capacity to serve customers on the East and West Coasts. Most importantly, we did this safely.
Our trailing 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.25 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. This level of exceptional execution will continue to serve our customers and shareholders well as we expect the global nitrogen supply demand balance to remain tight for the foreseeable future. 
Nitrogen demand will continue to be underpinned by the world's need to replenish global grain stocks. We believe it will take at least 2 years and possibly longer to accomplish this.
At the same time, high energy costs in Europe and Asia are likely to lower global operating rates at certain times of the year. So we expect nitrogen supply to remain tight with the marginal time being very high cost. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated both demand and supply situations. First, by impairing Ukraine's grain production and exports;  and second, by creating uncertainty about natural gas price and availability in Europe. Taken together, these factors make it likely that global nitrogen supply demand balance will stay tighter for longer.
Given these market dynamics, coupled with our position on the low end of the cost curve, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the coming years. This will enable us to invest in our clean energy growth initiatives while also returning substantial cash to shareholders. We are excited about growth opportunities we see in the clean energy applications of ammonia.
Earlier this week, we announced in conjunction with Mitsui, a potential new blue ammonia facility in North America. We also continue to advance both our green and blue ammonia projects at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana facility. 
We expect to begin making green hydrogen and green ammonia in 2023 and have up to 1.7 million tons of blue ammonia production beginning in 2024. These are important steps forward in the development of this exciting new market opportunity, one where we are clearly leading the way.
In a moment, Chris will provide more details on our approach to capital allocation moving forward, including our capital expenditure outlook and our return of capital program. But first, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Bert?"

This includes farmers who will be growing corn, wheat, cotton and rice.
As you can see on Slide 9, global coarse grain stocks-to-use ratios have not improved over the last 6 months, driving nitrogen-consuming crop prices toward record highs. The time line to replenish grain stock has been getting longer, not shorter. We believe it will take at least 2 more years and trend yields to fully replenish global stocks, supporting continued strong agricultural-led demand for nitrogen. 
We continue to expect healthy planted acres of nitrogen-consuming crops this year. Looking at new crop futures, returns for corn exceed those of soybeans, which supports our projection of 91 million to 93 million acres of corn planted in the United States in 2022, if weather cooperates.  
During the first quarter, our team leveraged the flexibility of our network to ensure that we were able to serve customers by helping prepare for this coming demand. Our rail utilization was at its highest level in years, and we increased UAN barge capacity. We also chartered 3x our typical volume of U.S. flagged Jones Act vessels to move UAN efficiently to the East and West Coasts. Rail service to some of our customers has become a serious issue in the second quarter, and we continue to work through those challenges.
We believe that high crop prices and strong farm income will also drive demand for nitrogen in the world's largest urea export destinations. We expect the recent urea tender by India to be the first in a regular cadence of tender activity in the coming months. We also project urea consumption in Brazil to remain strong in 2022. We do not see many catalysts in the near term to significantly increase global nitrogen supply availability. We expect China to resume urea exports in the second half of the year. However, it is unclear how large the volumes will be given the Chinese government's focus on keeping food inflation under control and balancing the environmental impact of coal-based urea production. 
Marginal production in Europe that cannot export to the Southern Hemisphere will face difficult operating decisions during the Northern Hemisphere off-season if natural gas costs continue to be high. We expect Russian fertilizer producers to continue to export but at reduced rate due to sanctions, limited internal logistics and port outlets, difficulty arranging insurance and vessel shipping.
CF Industries remained well positioned in this environment, even as natural gas costs in North America have increased. Natural gas forward curve suggests continued favorable energy spreads for North American producers compared to marginal production in Europe as you can see on Slide 12. 
We continue to work with customers on their requirements for the spring fertilizer application season as weather has largely delayed planting so far. Farmers have proven that they are able to plant their acres in a short amount of time once that weather window opens. While most customers are prepared for first applications, we will leverage our expertise and extend the distribution network to meet the top dress and side dress demand that will emerge after planting. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $883 million or $4.21 per diluted share.

For the first quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $883 million or $4.21 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.68 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.65 billion. The trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.8 billion.
Given the substantial free cash flow we are generating today and our confidence in the company's long-term free cash flow outlook, I want to walk you through our expectations for capital allocation moving forward. First, we reached our long-term gross debt target of $3 billion in April after we repaid the final $500 million of our 2023 notes. This level of debt and the work we've done over the years on lowering fixed charges provides us with financial flexibility now and through the cycle.
We expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $500 million to $550 million per year. This estimate includes planned maintenance activity as well as our investments in clean energy initiatives that are in progress. We continue to advance the Green Ammonia project at Donaldsonville Complex and have placed orders for all major equipment. The construction of the CO2 compression and dehydration facility at Donaldsonville is expected to be complete in 2024, enabling us to be first to market with the significant volume of blue ammonia once sequestration is initiated.
While we leveraged our existing network to create decarbonized ammonia capacity, we're excited to pursue organic growth in blue ammonia capacity through a joint venture with Mitsui. We believe the investment related to this effort in the next 2 years will be measured with a FEED study beginning shortly and FID in 2023. The nearly 50-50 joint venture will support our ongoing commitment to discipline investments in the emerging clean energy market and provide supply of low-carbon ammonia to support the global transition of clean energy.
Given these relatively modest calls on capital, we expect to have ample capital to return to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchases. The Board's decision to increase the dividend by 33% was driven by 2 main factors: the more positive outlook for cash generation across the cycle and the significant reduction in fixed charges we have achieved through debt reduction, share repurchases and other initiatives to eliminate frictional costs in the business.
We also continue to view share repurchases as an important way to provide shareholders a return on and return of capital. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 million. This represented the ratable portion of our share repurchase program for the quarter. Based on our free cash flow generation outlook, we expect to increase the ratable portion of our share repurchase program to $175 million per quarter. Along with the higher quarterly dividend, this positions us to return greater than $1 billion to shareholders on an annualized basis.
We are also prepared to opportunistically repurchase additional shares at attractive levels as we have in the past. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize the entire team here at CF Industries for their outstanding work during the quarter. Our focus continues to be on operating safely and leveraging our manufacturing and distribution network to serve customers, a role that is even more critically important today than ever. The North American agriculture sector, including CF Industries, is poised for strong results over the next several years as we collectively work to replenish global grain stocks.
The geopolitical issues in Europe, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine only increases the importance of the role North American farmers play as well as the rest of the supply chain in providing food for the world. The last year has underscored the critically important role of ammonia to the world, both for fertilizer and industrial applications. It has also confirmed our belief that new demand for ammonia in clean energy applications will grow significantly in the coming years.
CF Industries will be a leader in supplying blue and green ammonia to meet this emerging demand, and we are excited about our progress in this area. We have tremendous opportunities before us and we intend to capitalize on them to create meaningful shareholder value in both the near and longer term.

And I think the combination of having a geographically separate location to produce blue ammonia combined with the blue and green ammonia project at Donaldsonville give us some continuity of supply regardless of weather events like that such that we can enter into very reliable, long-term supply agreements for production of low and 0 carbon ammonia with counterparties. And that's really the reason why that put it at a different location than D'ville. 
In terms of why blue ammonia as opposed to a full-blown fertilizer plant with upgrades and everything, it really speaks to both ours as well as Mitsui's conviction that this is an area of not only emerging demand but very strong demand as we get out into the future.
And so we believe the world is going to need this. We think that, particularly given that the U.S. does not have a structured regulatory cost of carbon today, but most of the rest of the world or much of the rest of the world does, that an export-oriented facility where we can move those tons into the international marketplace and really leverage the skill set and capabilities that Mitsui brings as a partner is critically important and will serve us really well.
And I think from an overall kind of, you had mentioned economics or capital. The reason we're going through the FEED stage is to really get a much better handle on what the cost of the project is going to be. But just based on our recent experience, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, adjusting for inflation that's taking place, it wouldn't surprise me if we -- for a greenfield facility, we're in the neighborhood of $2 billion plus or minus for this.
But remember, it's basically a 50-50 investment for both of us. And it's paced out over 5 years. So think about that from our perspective as even though the money doesn't go out the door ratably like that, but you're talking about $200 million a year in terms of capital over the next 5 years. That's a relatively -- I mean, it's a significant amount of money. But given the fact that we generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow in the last 12 months, it's imminently affordable and not a crazy amount, and I feel really good about the prospects for that plant having a fantastic return profile for shareholders."

It's the process waste stream that comes from ammonia production using a steam methane reformer. And so we've already captured that.
In some instances, we use that CO2 for urea production and others, we end up venting the excess CO2 that we don't need. But the most capital intensive and costly aspect of CO2 sequestration is the capturing of CO2 to begin with. And because that's already baked into how an ammonia plant operates, the incremental cost that we're looking at is really just the dehydration and compression of the CO2 stream so that it's suitable for injection into geological sequestration wells.
And so for us, as we announced at Donaldsonville, we're looking at roughly $200 million for dehydration and compression and it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of $5 to $10 per ton of CO2 of incremental utility costs down there. And then there's going to be some transport and some injection costs as well. But that still leaves plenty of money available within the current framework of the 45Q tax credit to earn a very favorable return on the incremental capital that we need to put in place, which is only $200 million.
And for a greenfield facility or a brand-new facility, it's basically the same plant, whether you're doing conventional or blue, we're just adding the additional dehydration compression. So again, call it another roughly $200 million. And again, on that kind of basis, the 45Q tax credit provides a very attractive return profile for us.
So that's why ammonia production is pretty unique in the industrial landscape in terms of most likely able to take advantage of the 45Q credit. I think if you were doing flue gas capture or other things, you're talking about probably $120 to $150 a ton that you need the credit to get to in order to justify it based on today's technologies.

And I think some of those gating factors are real and pronounced today with what's going on with inflation and the government's desire to control that internally and not really looking externally for how that is impacted. And there was an announcement today or information in the trade publications about a continued enforcement of those export bans possibly through or into 2023.
So it's not clear how many tons will come out, when they'll come out. The previous position was in June that the export ban will be lifted. And so what we have seen is a very tight control of product, both [  NNP  ]coming out of China. And China represents about 10% of the global trade, so a significant portion taken off the market.
What we've seen internally to China is the price is controlled, almost half of what has been traded on the international market. So again, a reflection of controlling costs to the farmers and keeping that product in China. So we've been open that economically and from incentives as a marginal producer that they should be exporting on, again, on an economic basis. But on a governmental action basis, that probably will not happen. So let's just say we had probably expected 3 million to 4 million tons. It could be half or less than that, looking at it today."

That will take a couple of hundred million dollars. But as you point out, the amount of free cash flow that we have we'll be able to do everything from the share repurchases to the increased dividend that we just announced and also these projects.
I think the one thing is there's -- we're just talking about the projects that we've laid out here. We consistently look at other organic and inorganic projects. Over this past 12-month period, we've had almost $3 billion of free cash flow generation. And as Bert mentioned, some of the outlook that we see, that will be even greater. So I think it provides us a lot of opportunities to do a lot of different things. One, is to do the growth plans that we talked about here. And then two, is to also move into some of the share repurchase and return of capital that we talked about, not only the ratable portion, which is going to be $700 million this year but also the opportunistic piece. 
And given the volatility in our share price, I think we're looking at potential opportunities, not only this year but in the coming years where we can get in and get quite a bit of shares out at favorable return for shareholders."

We think we're well into the investment-grade ratings, even though we haven't been moved there yet. But if you just look at the strength of the business and how we're performing in the relatively small amount of debt that we're carrying, we feel very comfortable with that.
And so as Chris said, even if we're ultimately decided to move forward on this new blue ammonia project, it adds roughly, as I said, kind of $200 million plus or minus per year to a range that's $500 to $550 million of capital per year. We don't really have additional debt reduction, so call it, $700 million to $750 million of capital going out the door that we've earmarked already.
And as Chris pointed out, in the last 12 months, we did $2.8 billion of free cash flow. So that still leaves a very healthy amount for return of capital to shareholders. And I think based on how the business is performing, we can do all of the above."

But I think one of the things that we're seeing is return to appropriate valuation for UAN, where it belongs compared to urea. It is a more costly product to make than urea given that there's significantly more capital involved in the production process. It also offers farmers a tremendous product with great efficacy from an agronomic standpoint but also gives them some efficiencies in terms of application of other chemicals, whether it's fungicides or herbicides or insecticides or whatever can be mixed in with the UAN.
And so it provides benefits to the grower, it's higher cost to the producer.  Therefore, auto trade, generally speaking, at a premium to urea on a per unit of nitrogen basis. And that's where it is, again, and I think largely because of the fact that the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission put in the duties on product that was being dumped illegally by the Russians and the Trinidadians. And so our expectation, and I think generally speaking, as UAN should trade at this level premium to urea. In terms of kind of our plans going forward, I'll turn it over to Bert."

But product continues to flow and move to the interior. And as Tony said, it is trading in a premium to urea. And we have benefited or moved to a higher production and remain that way through first quarter favoring UAN over urea. And as long as that spread maintains, we will continue to do that.
The outlook is favorable. The demand is there with 91 million to 93 million acres of corn and what is taking place with restrictions of feed grains coming out of Russia and Ukraine, the world where we rely on Argentina, Brazil and the United States and to a lesser degree, India and Australia to supply the wheat and some of the corn out of South America, especially. And that will take a lot of nitrogen. And we're seeing growth in UAN in those markets and continued demand in North America. Europe is constrained. With the gas spreads taking place today at $30 TTF against $7 to $8 in North America, it is difficult to produce and participate in the global market from Europe as they have in the past. So we expect trade flows to change, especially as a result of Russia and then UAN from the United States to possibly go what's most urgently needed in a food-constrained world."

We have been working with our rail providers to have good solutions in place, whether that be service and railcars and that is a work in progress today.
And so we've been communicating with our customers on any potential delays or movements. But because of that, we've geared up with additional UAN large capacity as well as I mentioned in my prepared remarks vessels to go to the East and West Coast to just expand our capability to fully supply North America with needed UAN, and we've ramped up production, as we talked about in previous quarters. What I think is taking place then it gets to the delays because of weather.  And we've had cool wet weather, which has delayed access to the fields, and that impacts ammonia.
And so the conversations with customers today are very real of do you have enough in place? And if you're asking us to move it, don't rely necessarily on the railroads today, but what we can do with our distribution network. And I do think ammonia will be challenged. We still have a good portion of our ammonia to be applied to the ground. But I think you're going to quickly go to putting the seed in the ground, especially as we get closer to the middle of May and potential yield impacts of late planting.
So yes, we have sufficient storage. Yes, we have sufficient product. We are running our plants at 100% capacity and working very long hours to make sure that we supply our customers with the nitrogen nutrients that they need."

And you asked -- you're asking the question that we've all been trying to answer and have been doing a lot of work globally to put that quantitatively together to make decisions on movements of products and expectations for the forward curves. And when you look at what's taking place with restrictions out of the Black Sea on grains and oilseeds and even processed products, the world needs to increase the rest of the world's production and ability to ship, and that needs to happen in the Northern Hemisphere in the spring. 
And I think that's going to be constrained in Europe just with some limits on nutrients. I think we're fully supplied in North America and having good weather would be very helpful to a bountiful crop. And then it moves to South America, who plants in September, October, November, December, January for second crop and then the harvest thereafter. So it's -- to us, it's a 2023 issue.  When these potential shortages can materialize, and it could be constrained because of lack of nutrients.
With what's going on with restrictions or sanctions out of Belarus and Russia, and then you factor in 100% limitation because of the war out of Ukraine and then shipments out of the Black Sea and then governmental restrictions from China, you've taken out of urea, 25% of the urea supply. So you then need to move things around, maybe use more ammonium sulfate to different applications and price probably will have to impact some of that. I do think some of your third world countries that are planting non-dollar-denominated exportable products probably will have yield impacts that will require food imports. That's still to happen. 
And so these are things that we are watching, paying very close attention to and talking to our industry partners, whether that be grain companies, processing companies as well as distribution companies to make sure we're at the forefront of supplying the nutrients that we're capable of supplying on time and with a reasonable cost."

And that's why our view is that those assets will be running more intermittently, and you'll see lower operating rates as a result of it, which ends up making the supply-demand situation globally tight on an ongoing basis and even when it runs pretty high-cost marginal tons that are coming out of Europe.
And the spread of -- even if the spread collapses down to $10 between North America and Europe, $10 x 34 MMBtus per ton of ammonia x 10 million tons of ammonia. You're talking about $3.4 billion just an ammonia value for us before you even get into the upgrades and the value of the logistics network.
And that's only on a $10 spread. On a $20 spread obviously it's twice that. So the kind of energy curves that we're looking at going forward give us a lot of confidence about the cash generation of this business. And our U.K. assets are pretty de minimis in terms of the contribution they make to the overall profitability of the enterprise as well as the ammonia production volume. It's really North America that carries the freight in terms of what drives this company.
So we are okay running our European business, our U.K. business and assets when it's profitable to do so. And we're also okay taking those plants off-line when it's not profitable to do so. And so our view is we want to be, generally speaking, more daily buyers of gas in Europe, given where they sit on the cost curve and not try to take a long position on gas hedging there because we think those plants ought to cycle on and cycle off given where they sit in the global cost curve."

We are students of the market globally, just like we are with fertilizers, the key component of our cost. And it behooves us to be watching that diligently and buying and positioning ourselves appropriately. 
And today, as Tony said, that spread from North America to Europe is over $20, but even on the $23, $24 forward curve, it still is $20. So that's why you're going to see European production continue to be constrained and especially in the absence of Russian gas as we approach winter this coming fall and winter, I think it's going to be very challenged.
Your question about Russian shipments, yes, we are tracking what's being loaded and where it's being loaded. And I think the -- there are several limitations. And as you take away the logistical capabilities and movements and flexibility of the Russian producers coming out of whether that be Siberia in the Perm area or where they're loading internally to move to the external market, there's a tremendous change that has taken place due to the invasion and that's the limit of ports. So you had Black Sea ports, Mykolaiv, Odessa and others that have been load ports, but that product has to get through there. Those are no longer available. Same thing with ports that have been like in Riga and other places in the north, they're not Russian owned or accessed.
And so when you take the port capabilities down to probably 30% of the available outlets that then has a backup process of logistics, a backup process of storage and an inability to consistently move nitrogen phosphate and potash out as they did before. That will become more material as we move forward.
Then you layer on, on top of that insurance costs and vessel -- inability to get vessels or vessels not desiring to load in those ports and thereby pushing pricing up. Today, it's -- I think, like a St. Pete to Brazil is close to $200 a ton that was less than $50 just a few months ago.
And so these issues will continue to constrain Russian production on top of sanctions as we roll forward and if the sanctions do continue to be applied through 2022 and forward."

I mean I think there's a lot of runway left and a lot of uncertainty out there. And the longer you see these kind of energy spreads and the longer you've got, which obviously is a tragic, terrible situation with conflict. But the longer that persists, the more it pressures both the demand side because of grain availability as well as the supply side in terms of gas cost and availability. And so I would hesitate to call the -- this is a 1-year situation.
I think it puts us in a very enviable position. And as Chris said, we are focused on a ratable basis now between the dividend and the ratable portion of the share repurchase program, returning over $1 billion a year to shareholders. And that still gives us a lot of capacity to go in strong when we see drops in the share price and discontinuities like that. 
When a couple of weeks ago, there was a rumor of ceasefire, we dropped $15 in 1 day, and then we ended up catching some of that back through the course of the day. But we have a highly volatile stock, and we want to be able to absolutely capitalize when there is drops in the share price that are not connected to the fundamentals of the financial performance of the business.
And our belief is that, that is actually going to be in the best interest of our shareholders. And if that means we carry a little bit of extra cash on the balance sheet from time to time, so be it, I think when they see us like we did in the fourth quarter, taking out as many shares as we did at the average price of $60-some, that's a pretty attractive move. And so the fact that we can continue to do that and return a big chunk of cash on a ratable basis just again proves, I think, the value of this organization and company and the asset base that we've got here."

And those are things that Bert and Tony have been talking about for over the past year. So we've seen a fundamental shift in what our outlook is on that and seeing that for a longer bit of time than maybe even what we saw a year ago.
But then additionally, I think it's all the work we've done on our fixed charges over time. The mantra we've had over the last 3 years is really to reduce our fixed charges both through not only the debt reduction but even the share repurchase where we had lower amount of aggregate dollars going out for dividends. And then additionally, the work that Ashraf and his team have done through manufacturing to get our controllable costs down. So when you work all those things together, I think it's allowed us to increase the dividend without really changing our fixed charge outlook all that greatly.
And then that, coupled with where we see the nitrogen market fundamentally shifting to -- made us feel very comfortable in -- and I think the Board is well with their approval of it."

And so while I'm not forecasting another increase, it wouldn't surprise me if longer term based on the factors that Chris said, both lower fixed charges as well as better industry fundamentals, and a high share price, meaning a low dividend yield, that you wouldn't see it go up again at some point. So we're very bullish looking forward.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2022, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, net cash from operations of $4.4 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion, all of which are new company records.
To put this into context, our previous full year adjusted EBITDA record was $3.3 billion, which was set back in 2012. We exceeded this mark through just the first 6 months of this year. This all-time record free cash flow is coupled with our lowest share count ever, and the benefits to our shareholders are shown on Slides 14, 15 and 16 of our materials.
Our performance was made possible by the outstanding execution of the CF Industries' team against the backdrop of wide energy spreads between North America and high-cost production in Europe and Asia. Looking ahead, in the near term, we expect global nitrogen demand to be underpinned by the ongoing need to replenish global grain stocks. Longer term, we anticipate meaningful new demand to develop from low-carbon ammonia in clean energy applications beginning in the next couple of years.
Over this period, we believe that global LNG market will remain structurally tight as European and Asian economies compete for scarce LNG cargoes, keeping natural gas prices high in these regions, which should support continued wide energy spreads favoring North American producers. Given this outlook, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow for an extended period. This will enable us to return significant capital to shareholders, while we also make disciplined investments to grow our low-carbon ammonia production footprint.
Our blue ammonia project at Donaldsonville and our partnership with Mitsui position us to supply a substantial volume of low-carbon ammonia beginning in 2025, just as significant demand emerges. Taken together, our growth initiatives and shareholder return programs position us well to create meaningful shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss global nitrogen market conditions in more detail. Bert?"

The first half and second quarter of 2022 saw a continued positive operating environment for CF Industries. Strong global demand and high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia pushed global nitrogen prices to all-time highs. As a result, we achieved record average selling prices for all segments, even as poor weather affected the North American planting and application season.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we believe the environment will remain favorable for our company. European and Asian producers are facing extremely high natural gas costs, creating supply uncertainty at a time of resilient agricultural-led demand. Last week, prices at the Dutch TTF natural gas hub exceeded $60 per MMBtu. This would put ammonia production costs for efficient plants in Europe above $2,000 per metric ton. 
At current product prices, this production is not sustainable, which is why we have seen several producers in Europe, including BASF, Yara, OCI and Fertiberia curtail ammonia output. Producers with the option to import ammonia may be able to run upgrades profitably.
For those who can on, the European off-season is likely to be very difficult, and we could see further curtailments and increased nitrogen imports into Europe. At the same time, government actions continue to play a role in limiting global supply. Since October of last year, Chinese government policy has materially restricted urea exports. We do expect a seasonal increase in Chinese export volume in the second half of the year, but appears total exports in 2022 will be well below the level of last several years.
In contrast, the supply of fertilizer from Russia outside of ammonia has returned to near normal levels as trade flows have adapted over the last several months. This environment, together with typical seasonal demand led by India and Brazil, has created substantial demand outside of North America for all nitrogen products. We evaluate these opportunities on a daily basis. 
For the past several weeks, the value of all major nitrogen products has been substantially at parity on a nutrient basis. This allows us to use our manufacturing system flexibility to optimize our product mix and meet global demand in the form and location that maximizes margins. As a result, we have built our largest export book ever across all our products.
Given the demand outside of North America, we offered a limited UAN fill program this year. We launched it at a price point about 40% higher than last year and completed the program quickly. Between fill and our export book and our fall ammonia position, we are well positioned for the months ahead.
In the coming months, we expect the highest margin opportunities to shift rapidly between regions where product is most needed. With resilient demand and constrained supply, the global nitrogen market is likely to be short fertilizer it needs if product prices do not incentivize greater production in high-cost regions.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

We continue to make progress on the clean energy initiatives at the heart of our growth platform. We recently signed a joint development agreement with Mitsui that provides the framework for the next steps in our exploration of new blue ammonia capacity in the United States. This includes the FEED study that we expect to begin in the second half of 2022 once we finalize the site and technology provider for the proposed plant.
Additionally, our green and blue ammonia projects at Donaldsonville are advancing. The site where a 20-megawatt electrolyzer will be located has visible signs of progress, though the bulk of the construction will occur in 2023. Detailed engineering is underway for the dehydration and compression facilities necessary for the transportation and permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide. We expect to complete this project by the end of 2024.
On an annual basis, expenditures for these clean energy initiatives represent only a modest outlay of capital compared to our expected free cash flow generation. We do expect to hold a higher level of cash on our balance sheet in the coming years as we intend to fund the Donaldsonville projects and our portion of the proposed Mitsui joint venture project from cash on hand.
Given our outlook, we believe we will have ample flexibility to pursue additional growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria. We also plan on returning substantial capital to shareholders over this period. Through the first 6 months of the year, we are well positioned to exceed our goal of returning more than $1 billion in capital on an annual basis. This starts with our quarterly dividend, which the Board increased by 33% in April, demonstrating its confidence in our outlook and recognizing the work we've done to reduce fixed costs.
We also continue to execute our current $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as both a return on and return of capital. Through the first 6 months, we have repurchased 6.6 million shares for $590 million. As you can see in our level of repurchase activity in the second quarter, we 
stepped in opportunistically to repurchase shares as our stock price fell despite positive industry fundamentals. 
Moving forward, we expect to maintain this approach with a ratable portion of our share repurchase program at $175 million per quarter and opportunistic purchases layered in at attractive levels.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their outstanding work during the first half of the year. We ran our plants extremely well, leveraged our logistics and distribution capabilities and made continued progress on our strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we did this safely. Our trailing 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.21 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. 
Our consistently strong operational performance, along with nitrogen industry conditions, favorable to North American producers have led to record financial results over the last year. In the last 12 months, we have begun investing in our clean energy growth initiatives, retired $750 million of debt and regained investment-grade ratings and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. 
This includes $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 15 million shares, representing 7% of shares outstanding at the start of the period. We are well positioned to build on our track record of shareholder value creation going forward as we focus on our mission to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

They're competing with Europe on LNG cargoes. 
And you're looking at a situation with $60 at TTF plus, as Bert said, it's $2,000 ammonia. That's not where the market is trading right now. So in our view,  this is actually pretty constructive about the go forward. It means that the amount of production in those high-cost regions is going to be somewhat limited.  The challenge there, of course, is it means the world is going to be incredibly tight availability of product as we get into both the winter and then into the spring next year, particularly if the situation in Europe is not resolved in the coming months because that just further pressures the whole system with winter coming."

That is a substantial amount of nitrogen that's constrained. 
And so you're going to see the North African tons move that direction. But even from other places, they have to be supply in Europe. And so like Tony said, either prices have to move up or you're going to see Europe become much more of an import-dependent market than it already is, both bode well for prices."

That's pretty unprecedented. But it also means that there's no reason for us to make UAN and sell it at fill pricing into tanks or inventory at this point when the world is going so short ammonia. 
So yes, we do have record exports. We are exporting some UAN. We had a very limited UAN fill program, specifically because our focus is on ammonia and exports right now. And I think that's going to bode really well for us, not only in the near term based on what demand and margin opportunities look like, but also when it becomes spring time in the Northern Hemisphere next year because all of those skill tons are not going to be sitting in the system and the channel in the U.S. So we're very constructive about what the forward looks like."

And so the level of exports is over, I think, 30 vessels today in our export lineup. 
And you're right, we saw these opportunities. It was based on the economics of the decision of not only the operating economics but the global economics predicated on freight and margin return to CF Industries. And so we have shifted that production mix, and we'll continue to do so. I do see a tariff cut coming in Europe. They've already announced they're working on urea and ammonia. And we would expect that UAN would be in the same position just because of the needs of the tons and the requirements of Europe to meet their agricultural fertilizer needs.

We make decisions about which products to upgrade based on instantaneous margin opportunities. .
But the one thing that if you're not making ammonia, then you don't have those other options. So our focus is really on running our -- the ammonia assets at maximum capacity and onstream factor. And we're still in the kind of 9.5% to 10% range on that for the full year. Again, as you point out, with a little heavier turnaround activity here in Q3. But Ashraf has the plants running really well and safety is terrific. And relative to product mix, that's really a function of where margins are. And right now, we're favoring ammonia and we're favoring exports because that provides both the best instantaneous opportunity for monetizing the product and also just sets us up really well for come spring time."

And I'm going to start with the third one first in the tighter market, yes.

And then the announcement yesterday that they are gas-constrained and gas is not shipping the LNG and that was purchased or expected and having to cut production there 10% of urea, that's going to create an additional import demand to meet their needs. 
And so we're seeing, again, because of high prices in Q2, some delays that will be materialized in Q3. But the balance -- or the negative balance of that is lack of gas, lack of production in not only Europe but other constrained areas. So when you look at the market, we see a tight market through and then well into next year. When you look at consumption relative to historical,  we had a little bit lower acres in the United States than expected and a late planting. So I think that had an impact in North America. 
But when you look at, again, what -- how that's going to balance for the year, for CF, we have a great book and are eagerly looking to the back half of the year to supply that."

And I think from that perspective, we're not anticipating that there is any kind of substantial makeup relative to global stocks to use which is why we see this persistent demand on the ag side for longer. And I think it's really going to be an interesting proof point when all the harvest information is tallied globally around where yields come in, but our expectation is we're going to be in a deficit situation for quite a while.

And that will be producing about 20,000 tons of green ammonia per year. So it's a little bit of a modest first step in that direction. But we want to get comfortable and confident on the technology and the process and also really testing the market to see what the demand and the price premium is for green ammonia. 
The Mitsui agreement that we have is really about a brand-new blue ammonia project, so carbon capture and sequestration. And we're in the process of finalizing site selection and trying to get appropriate incentive packages worked out with state and local authorities to make that happen. And we're anticipating that would be about 1.3 million, 1.4 million ton a year ammonia plant that incorporates carbon capture and sequestration to produce blue ammonia. 
And yes, I mean we're really excited about the competitive position that North American natural gas affords and the ability, both from a regulatory regime, but also a geological perspective to be able to do carbon capture and sequestration here. We think it's great to be able to participate and take advantage of the natural advantages that we have here in the U.S. And we're -- that analysis is going to be very site specific about what is required for that ammonia plant and also to get a pretty tight estimate on cost. And then we'll use that information and a thoughtful, disciplined way around making the investment decision or not. 
But our expectation is, particularly given where the cost of hydrocarbons are in the rest of the world and how chronically short Europe is and what the cost of building out and replacing existing capacity with green is that, that project, at least initially has terrific economics associated with it. And we just need to prove it out before we go ahead and greenlight it and move forward. But our expectation is, yes, we are absolutely going to be participating in the demand growth in this space. 
And what we like is being able to participate in the clean energy aspects of low-carbon ammonia. So that probably is not going to be an upgrade plant for fertilizer consumption. It's really going to be a clean energy plant. Relative to debottlenecking the existing system, we've done a lot of that over the years, and we've kind of hit sort of natural breakpoints on a number of our plants in terms of -- it really makes more sense to invest in new capacity at this point than it does to continue to try to squeeze more out of what's already there because you end up hitting the limits on heat exchangers and other things that then you end up with reliability problems. 
We're very proud of the reliability and the on-stream factor of our network. We're running it really well, very safely, and it's kind of finely tuned right now. So I think you're more likely to see us do new plants than you are debottleneck existence."

You're going to see an additional, let's say, 3 million to 4 million acres of corn in North America for next year. On top of strong corn demand, ethanol is running at 90%. China is going to be importing a significant level of corn. And your protein sector is healthy. The dollar is very strong today, and that's going to incentivize global production of feed grains. 
The problem in the United States is we've got a drought that covers 30% of the corn production area. So it's a question, will we even hit the yields we want to? And then you look at what's going on globally, not just with gas, but with freight costs. It's $100 -- $70 to $100 to move product out of Russia and freight costs, overall, even coming out of the Middle East position CF as a domestic producer in a wonderful position, and there's not a lot of new tons coming on to add capacity to the market. 
And you've talked about the Russian ammonia pipeline is down. Those exports are down. So you have 200,000 tons of ammonia per month, not moving to the North African phosphate producers. Farm incomes at its highest level, probably in 10 years. So the money is there, not only for the American and Canadian farmer, but for the Brazilian. And I think with -- because of the weak currency in Argentina, even more so in Argentina. And we're an import-dependent markets. 
We have to attract these tons as well now Europe and requiring more imports. And then you throw in what Tony just talked about with a gas shortage. And that's -- there is only limited supply of LNG now with India being 40% to 60% dependent on imported gas and unable to get it, they're going to have to import more urea. So we're structurally with those issues driving our market, whether that be the grains, the livestock, ethanol, energy, all require what we're producing at a very strong level. So for that reason, we're very constructive forward at least '23, '24."

And thirdly, in any blue -- any production of blue ammonia or blue hydrogen, is it unlikely that though that, that production can get a hydrogen credit because of the way gas leakage is or the CO2 effect of gas leakage is calculated?"

Related to your second question was some of the methane slip and such that may happen upstream. What we're talking about is the blue ammonia is what gets the 45Q. So we would be taking the CO2 with the dehydration and compression projects that both Tony and I spoke about, sequestering that long term and getting that credit, which today per Class 6 permanent sequestration sits at about $50 per metric ton, but is proposed in this latest inflation reduction to go up to $85, more than enough to cover the incremental operating costs and expense that we have in there. So we're pretty bullish about the direction that the clean energy, low hydrogen or I mean low carbon ammonia is going."

So the world bids in a certain amount of capacity. And for the most part, it's whatever that highest cost ton that gets built into production, plus freight differentials that ultimately set kind of global pricing. And right now, given the level of curtailments that you see across both Europe and Asia, the global operating rate is operating at a deficit relative to what normal build this during this period of time. And so that just cascades forward. 
So if you say that the forward gas curve for TTF is right, I mean, eventually, you're either going to destroy demand and ration a very scarce commodity or pricing is going to have to rise to turn on some of those assets. And so if you're talking about marginal production cost of $2,000, plus or minus, that's where things could have. Now if  we get a hopeful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine and gas starts flowing again, and you see that using then, that will ripple through the price deck. But the way that it sits today, it's shaping up to be a very scarce commodity as we move into the winter months."

We're also hearing about demand destruction in various pockets of ammonia, whether it's on the nitrogen side or the industrial side or phosphate. Is it possible that when the Northern Hemisphere reengages in the fall that we won't need the Europeans at all? And essentially, they will be temporarily kicked off the curve. And if so, what does that mean for Asia's marginal cost of ammonia production?"

So there's no doubt that in a globally tight commodity price has got to ration demand, right, because there's just not enough supply to go around. So temporary, whether you call it demand destruction or deferral has got to happen because there's just not enough product to go every place that it's  desired. And so certainly, those that are value it less are not going to have access to it. 
But that said, historically, those assets have run and have run at a reasonably high onstream factor and the globe has needed those tons in order to be able to run the food production system as well as the industrial applications of ammonia. And without those tons showing up, you're chronically short and something is -- someone's going to go without. 
So think about the world as being approximately 180 million tons of ammonia production annually and -- or consumption and it needs that. If you've got 15 million tons, that's a huge percentage of it that's offline. And that's just Europe, that's not even including what's going on in Asia and with curtailments going on in India and so forth. So this is a big deficit that the world is facing relative to nitrogen availability as we move forward through the balance of this year and into next spring."

And the basis points that we follow are, obviously, Henry Hub for North America, NVP for U.K., TTF for Europe and JKM for Asia, and those are traded points that are on the board. And so you're able to follow that by the minute what those prices are. 
And what is happening and has happened is Asia and Europe are trading in concert. And the reason for that is they're competing for that ton. And over the last several months, it's almost like the Asian buying groups have been slower, and I think they were in a better position, and that has pushed more LNG to Europe to fill their needed storage and especially with the reflection of the limits on Nord Stream 1, that was a good move. 
So the different groups have targeted a percentage of storage that we hope that they get there and that's just to operate and to keep homes warm in the winter. But that does have an industrial component. And I think that will limit industrial production in Europe, and there's many discussions going on with what can be cut, what levels for power or like BASF importing ammonia and they're not needing that gas for that type of their component or of their industrial footprint. 
But I think what's going to happen over the next several months is as we compete and get closer to winter, India short, we've already mentioned that. So they're already asking for a 10% cut of urea production and half of that production is using imported gas. There are other areas. China also has areas that import and Japan. But there are other countries, Malaysia, Indonesia that have their own production and their own production of nitrogen. 
So this is going. It's imbalance today. Price is bidding it, and we'll see where that settles out over the next several months. But there's a very limited amount of that's available, whether that's from Qatar, Australia, United States, Indonesia, Malaysia. And with the Freeport explosion that took 2 Bcf a day off the market, it's just that much tighter. So we'll see how it goes, but that's -- today, it's tight."

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2022, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion,",354,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2022, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, net cash from operations of $4.4 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion, all of which are new company records.
To put this into context, our previous full year adjusted EBITDA record was $3.3 billion, which was set back in 2012. We exceeded this mark through just the first 6 months of this year. This all-time record free cash flow is coupled with our lowest share count ever, and the benefits to our shareholders are shown on Slides 14, 15 and 16 of our materials.
Our performance was made possible by the outstanding execution of the CF Industries' team against the backdrop of wide energy spreads between North America and high-cost production in Europe and Asia. Looking ahead, in the near term, we expect global nitrogen demand to be underpinned by the ongoing need to replenish global grain stocks. Longer term, we anticipate meaningful new demand to develop from low-carbon ammonia in clean energy applications beginning in the next couple of years.
Over this period, we believe that global LNG market will remain structurally tight as European and Asian economies compete for scarce LNG cargoes, keeping natural gas prices high in these regions, which should support continued wide energy spreads favoring North American producers. Given this outlook, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow for an extended period. This will enable us to return significant capital to shareholders, while we also make disciplined investments to grow our low-carbon ammonia production footprint.
Our blue ammonia project at Donaldsonville and our partnership with Mitsui position us to supply a substantial volume of low-carbon ammonia beginning in 2025, just as significant demand emerges. Taken together, our growth initiatives and shareholder return programs position us well to create meaningful shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss global nitrogen market conditions in more detail. Bert?"
22357184,1771540281,2612152,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2022",2022-08-02,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

The first half and second quarter of 2022 saw a continued positive operating environment for CF Industries. Strong global demand and high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia pushed global nitrogen prices to all-time highs. As a result, we achieved record average selling prices for all segments, even as poor weather affected the North American planting and application season.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we believe the environment will remain favorable for our company. European and Asian producers are facing extremely high natural gas costs, creating supply uncertainty at a time of resilient agricultural-led demand. Last week, prices at the Dutch TTF natural gas hub exceeded $60 per MMBtu. This would put ammonia production costs for efficient plants in Europe above $2,000 per metric ton. At current product prices, this production is not sustainable, which is why we have seen several producers in Europe, including BASF, Yara, OCI and Fertiberia curtail ammonia output. Producers with the option to import ammonia may be able to run upgrades profitably.
For those who can on, the European off-season is likely to be very difficult, and we could see further curtailments and increased nitrogen imports into Europe. At the same time, government actions continue to play a role in limiting global supply. Since October of last year, Chinese government policy has materially restricted urea exports. We do expect a seasonal increase in Chinese export volume in the second half of the year, but appears total exports in 2022 will be well below the level of last several years.
In contrast, the supply of fertilizer from Russia outside of ammonia has returned to near normal levels as trade flows have adapted over the last several months. This environment, together with typical seasonal demand led by India and Brazil has created substantial demand outside of North America for all nitrogen products.
We evaluate these opportunities on a daily basis. For the past several weeks, the value of all major nitrogen products has been substantially at parity on a nutrient basis. This allows us to use our manufacturing system flexibility to optimize our product mix and meet global demand in the form and location that maximizes margins. As a result, we have built our largest export book ever across all our products.
Given the demand outside of North America, we offered a limited UAN fill program this year. We launched it at a price point about 40% higher than last year and completed the program quickly. Between fill and our export book and our fall ammonia position, we are well positioned for the months ahead.
In the coming months, we expect the highest margin opportunities to shift rapidly between regions where product is most needed. With resilient demand and constrained supply, the global nitrogen market is likely to be short fertilizer, it needs if product prices do not incentivize greater production in high-cost regions.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $2 billion or $9.78 per diluted share. EBITDA was $3.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 billion. Based on our long-term outlook, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow over an extended period of time. This will enable us to pursue our capital allocation priorities of investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders.
We continue to make progress on the clean energy initiatives at the heart of our growth platform. We recently signed a joint development agreement with Mitsui that provides the framework for the next steps in our exploration of new blue ammonia capacity in the United States. This includes the FEED study that we expect to begin in the second half of 2022 once we finalize the site and technology provider for the proposed plant.
Additionally, our green and blue ammonia project at Donaldsonville are advancing. The site where a 20-megawatt electrolyzer will be located has visible signs of progress, though the bulk of the construction will occur in 2023. Detailed engineering is underway for the dehydration and compression facilities necessary for the transportation and permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide. We expect to complete this project by the end of 2024.
On an annual basis, expenditures for these clean energy initiatives represent only a modest outlay of capital compared to our expected free cash flow generation. We do expect to hold a higher level of cash on our balance sheet in the coming years as we intend to fund the Donaldsonville projects and our portion of the proposed Mitsui joint venture project from cash on hand.
Given our outlook, we believe we will have ample flexibility to pursue additional growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria. We also plan on returning substantial capital to shareholders over this period. Through the first 6 months of the year, we are well positioned to exceed our goal of returning more than $1 billion in capital on an annual basis. This starts with our quarterly dividend, which the Board increased by 33% in April, demonstrating its confidence in our outlook and recognizing the work we've done to reduce fixed costs.
We also continue to execute our current $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as both a return on and return of capital. Through the first 6 months, we have repurchased 6.6 million shares for $590 million. As you can see in our level of repurchase activity in the second quarter, we stepped in opportunistically to repurchase shares as our stock price fell despite positive industry fundamentals. Moving forward, we expect to maintain this approach with a ratable portion of our share repurchase program at $175 million per quarter and opportunistic purchases layered in at attractive levels.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their outstanding work during the first half of the year. We ran our plants extremely well, leveraged our logistics and distribution capabilities and made continued progress on our strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we did this safely. Our trailing 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.21 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages.
Our consistently strong operational performance, along with nitrogen industry conditions favorable to North American producers have led to record financial results over the last year. In the last 12 months, we have begun investing in our clean energy growth initiatives, retired $750 million of debt and regained investment-grade ratings and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. This includes $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 15 million shares representing 7% of shares outstanding at the start of the period. We are well positioned to build on our track record of shareholder value creation going forward as we focus on our mission to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably.

It's not just in Europe, it's in Asia as well. If you think about it, I think India has announced that they're not getting as much LNG import from Russia as they were expecting, they've curtailed some of their urea production. They're competing with Europe on LNG cargoes.
And you're looking at a situation with $60 a TTF plus, as Bert said, it's $2,000 ammonia. That's not where the market is trading right now. So in our view, this is actually pretty constructive about the go forward. It means that the amount of production in those high-cost regions is going to be somewhat limited. The challenge there, of course, is it means the world is going to be incredibly tight availability of product as we get into both the winter and then into the spring next year, particularly if the situation in Europe is not resolved in the coming months because that just further pressures the whole system with winter coming."

When you look at what's going on globally, it's not just the gas, it's what the gas is changing and forcing and that's a change in trade flows, a change in movements and probably even a change in the type of fertilizer you'll be using because of an inability possibly to get ammonium nitrate, for example. Europe today represents 15 million tons of ammonia, probably 9 million tons of urea, 4 million tons of UAN and probably 9 million or 10 million tons of ammonium nitrate. That is a substantial amount of nitrogen that's constrained.
And so you're going to see the North African tons move that direction. But even from other places, they have to be supply in Europe. And so like Tony said, either prices have to move up or you're going to see Europe become much more of an import-dependent market than it already is, both bode well for prices."

And I'll start, and then I'll give the mic over to Bert here in just a second. But the -- as Bert said in his remarks, the way product pricing sits kind of in the moment, we're kind of margin indifferent between the type of product that is being produced, which is unusual that ammonia pricing and margins are so high on a nutrient basis. That's pretty unprecedented. But it also means that there's no reason for us to make UAN and sell it at fill pricing into tanks or inventory at this point when the world is going so short ammonia.
So yes, we do have record exports. We are exporting some UAN. We had a very limited UAN fill program, specifically because our focus is on ammonia and exports right now. And I think that's going to bode really well for us, not only in the near term based on what demand and margin opportunities look like, but also when it becomes spring time in the Northern Hemisphere next year because all of those fill tons are not going to be sitting in the system and the channel in the U.S. So we're very constructive about what the forward looks like."

So it'd be in an 8-hour period to load out in Donaldsonville substantial, and we're even able to bring interior tons to Donaldsonville to load, whether that would be through a midstream operation or off of our own dock. And so the level of exports is over, I think, 30 vessels today in our export lineup.
And you're right, we saw these opportunities. It was based on the economics of the decision of not only the operating economics but the global economics predicated on freight and margin return to CF Industries. And so we have shifted that production mix, and we'll continue to do so. I do see a tariff cut coming in Europe. They've already announced they're working on urea and ammonia. And we would expect that UAN would be in the same position just because of the needs of the tons and the requirements of Europe to meet their agricultural fertilizer needs.

We make decisions about which products to upgrade based on instantaneous margin opportunities. But the one thing that if you're not making ammonia, then you don't have those other options.
So our focus is really on running our -- the ammonia assets at maximum capacity and on-stream factor. And we're still in the kind of 9.5% to 10% range on that for the full year. Again, as you point out, with a little heavier turnaround activity here in Q3. But Ashraf has the plants running really well and safety is terrific. And relative to product mix, that's really a function of where margins are. And right now, we're favoring ammonia and we're favoring exports because that provides both the best instantaneous option for monetizing the product and also just sets us up really well for come spring time."

And then the announcement yesterday that they are gas-constrained and Gazprom is not shipping the LNG and that was purchased or expected and having to cut production there 10% of urea, that's going to create an additional import demand to meet their needs.
And so we're seeing, again, because of high prices in Q2, some delays that will be materialized in Q3. But the balance -- or the negative balance of that is lack of gas, lack of production in not only Europe but other constrained areas. So when you look at the market, we see a tight market through and then well into next year. When you look at consumption relative to historical, we had a little bit lower acres in the United States than expected and a late planting. So I think that had an impact in North America.
But when you look at, again, what that's -- how that's going to balance for the year, for CF, we have a great book and are eagerly looking to the back half of the year to supply that."

And so the world just had less nutrients to go down.
And I think from that perspective, we're not anticipating that there is any kind of substantial makeup relative to global stocks to use on core screens, which is why we see this persistent demand on the ag side for longer. And I think it's really going to be an interesting proof point when all the harvest information is tallied globally around where yields come in, but our expectation is we're going to be in a deficit situation for quite a while.

The green ammonia project that we have is at Donaldsonville, and that's a 20-megawatt electrolyzer that's in process, and we expect that to be online in 2023-2024 time frame. And that will be producing about 20,000 tons of green ammonia per year. So it's a little bit of a modest first step in that direction. But we want to get comfortable and confident on the technology and the process and also really testing the market to see what the demand and the price premium is for green ammonia.
The Mitsui agreement that we have is really about a brand-new blue ammonia project, so carbon capture and sequestration. And we're in the process of finalizing site selection and trying to get appropriate incentive packages worked out with state and local authorities to make that happen. And we're anticipating that would be about 1.3 million, 1.4 million ton a year ammonia plant that incorporates carbon capture and sequestration to produce blue ammonia.
And yes, I mean, we're really excited about the competitive position that North American natural gas affords and the ability, both from a regulatory regime, but also a geological perspective to be able to do carbon capture and sequestration here. We think it's great to be able to participate and take advantage of the natural advantages that we have here in the U.S. And we're -- that analysis is going to be very site specific about what is required for that ammonia plant and also to get a pretty tight estimate on cost. And then we'll use that information in a thoughtful, disciplined way around making the investment decision or not.
But our expectation is, particularly given where the cost of hydrocarbons are in the rest of the world and how chronically short Europe is and what the cost of building out and replacing existing capacity with green is that, that project, at least initially has terrific economics associated with it. And we just need to prove it out before we go ahead and greenlight it and move forward. But our expectation is, yes, we are absolutely going to be participating in the demand growth in this space.
And what we like is being able to participate in the clean energy aspects of low-carbon ammonia. So that probably is not going to be an upgrade plant for fertilizer consumption. It's really going to be a clean energy plant.
Relative to debottlenecking the existing system, we've done a lot of that over the years, and we've kind of hit sort of natural breakpoints on a number of our plants in terms of -- it really makes more sense to invest in new capacity at this point than it does to continue to try to squeeze more out of what's already there because you end up hitting the limits on heat exchangers and other things that then you end up with reliability problems.
We're very proud of the reliability and the on-stream factor of our network. We're running it really well, very safely, and it's kind of finely tuned right now. So I think you're more likely to see us do new plants than you are debottleneck existence."

And even though you didn't ask this question, I'm going to answer it anyway, which is why we stepped up share repurchases in the quarter because we're taking a fundamentally different view around how much -- what the demand looks like for our products, where the supply points are, what the energy spread differential and the margin opportunity is, and it makes us very bullish.

And I think when you take a step back, just to focus on EU, but you list out some of the areas and issues driving our markets demand and supply. You're going to see an additional, let's say, 3 million to 4 million acres of corn in North America for next year. On top of strong corn demand, ethanol is running at 90%. China is going to be importing a significant level of corn. And your protein sector is healthy. The dollar is very strong today, and that's going to incentivize global production of feed grains.
The problem in the United States is we've got a drought that covers 30% of the corn production area. So it's a question, will we even hit the yields we want to? And then you look at what's going on globally, not just with gas or with freight costs, it's $100 -- $70 to $100 to move product out of Russia and freight costs, overall, even coming out of the Middle East position CF as a domestic producer in a wonderful position, and there's not a lot of new tons coming on to add capacity to the market.
And you've talked about the Russian ammonia pipeline is down. Those exports are down. So you have 200,000 tons of ammonia per month, not moving to the North African phosphate producers. Farm income is at its highest level, probably in 10 years. So the money is there, not only for the American and Canadian farmer, but for the Brazilian. And I think with -- because of the weak currency in Argentina, even more so in Argentina. And we're an import-dependent markets.
We have to attract these tons as well now Europe and requiring more imports. And then you throw in what Tony just talked about with a gas shortage. And that's -- there is only limited supply of LNG, now with India being 40% to 60% dependent on imported gas and unable to get it, they're going to have to import more urea. So we're structurally with those issues driving our market, whether that would be the grains, the livestock, ethanol, energy, all require what we're producing at a very strong level. So for that reason, we're very constructive forward at least '23, '24."

Related to your second question was some of the methane slip and such that may happen upstream. What we're talking about is the blue ammonia is what gets the 45Q. So we would be taking the CO2 with the dehydration and compression projects that both Tony and I spoke about, sequestering that long term and getting that credit, which today per Class 6 permanent sequestration sits at about $50 per metric ton, but is proposed in this latest inflation reduction to go up to $85, more than enough to cover the incremental operating costs and expense that we have in there.

And right now, given the level of curtailments that you see across both Europe and Asia, the global operating rate is operating at a deficit relative to what normal build is during this period of time. And so that just cascades forward.
So if you say that the forward gas curve for TTF is right, I mean, eventually, you're either going to destroy demand and ration a very scarce commodity or pricing is going to have to rise to turn on some of those assets. And so if you're talking about marginal production cost of $2,000, plus or minus, that's where things could have. Now if  we get a hopeful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine and gas starts flowing again, and you see that using then, that will ripple through the price deck.

And so certainly, those that are value it less are not going to have access to it.
But that said, historically, those assets have run and have run at a reasonably high on-stream factor and the globe has needed those tons in order to be able to run the food production system as well as the industrial applications of ammonia. And without those tons showing up, you're chronically short and something is -- someone's going to go without.
So think about the world as being approximately 180 million tons of ammonia production annually and -- or consumption and it needs that. If you've got 15 million tons, that's a huge percentage of it that's offline. And that's just Europe, that's not even including what's going on in Asia and with curtailments going on in India and so forth.

And so you're able to follow that by the minute what those prices are.
And what is happening and has happened is Asia and Europe are trading in concert. And the reason for that is they're competing for that ton. And over the last several months, it's almost like the Asian buying groups have been slower, and I think they were in a better position, and that has pushed more LNG to Europe to fill their needed storage and especially with the reflection of the limits on Nord Stream 1, that was a good move.
So the different groups have targeted a percentage of storage that we hope that they get there and that's just to operate and to keep homes warm in the winter. But that does have an industrial component. And I think that will limit industrial production in Europe, and there's many discussions going on with what can be cut, what levels for power or like BASF importing ammonia and they're not needing that gas for that type of their component or of their industrial footprint.
But I think what's going to happen over the next several months is as we compete and get closer to winter, India is short, we've already mentioned that. So they're already asking for a 10% cut of urea production and half of that production is using imported gas. There are other areas. China also has areas that import and Japan. But there are other countries, Malaysia, Indonesia that have their own production and their own production of nitrogen.
So this is going. It's imbalance today. Price is bidding it, and we'll see where that settles out over the next several months. But there's a very limited amount of LNG that's available, whether that's from Qatar, Australia, United States, Indonesia, Malaysia. And with the Freeport explosion that took 2 Bcf a day off the market, it's just that much tighter. So we'll see how it goes, but that's -- today, it's tight."

But I think there's certainly a question and a risk off from just inventory cost position when you're carrying it for a long period of time, that does create a little bit of hesitancy.
I think you also tend to, in some cases, trade last year's news. And if you looked at where we were trading last year, at this time, pricing was 40% or more lower than where we are today. And so I think that there is a general expectation of, well, this year is going to end up looking something like last year or the year before. And it's not really predicated on current situation of what's going on with gas spreads globally. And they don't have an urgent immediate need for it. So the thinking is will it hold off because maybe tomorrow will be cheaper than today."

Our retail, wholesale trader checks and relationships and communication, they've all closed out on a fertilizer year, which is July through June, a very profitable year. And they don't want to start off in a negative position. So those who thought that some of the fill and fall prices were high, just chose not to purchase, which is fine. We want to support that group that wants to push it to spring.
But with the dynamics we've laid out today, our communication to them is that's fine, but prices do move, it's a global commodity. And in a commodity market where corn and soybeans and wheat and cotton and sugar are all higher price and in a high demand, there's going to be a significant level of demand, in addition to the industrial needs.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, our adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion, and our free cash flow was a whopping $3.7 billion. our industry-leading EBITDA to free cash flow conversion efficiency is an incredible, 63%. 
These results reflect continued outstanding execution by the CF Industries team. Our plants are running well, and we continue to leverage our distribution and logistics capabilities to navigate rapidly changing global environment. Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. At the end of the quarter, our 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.29 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, well below industry averages. 
Our team's remarkable performance took place against the backdrop of a very tight global nitrogen supply-demand balance. As Bert will explain in a moment, we believe the dynamics underpinning this environment will remain in place for an extended period, namely strong agricultural-led demand and high energy prices in Europe and Asia. Based on this outlook, we expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders. 
We remain focused on our clean energy growth initiatives, highlighted by the development of our blue ammonia capacity. Most recently, we reached a landmark carbon capture and sequestration agreement with ExxonMobil for our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex. We have also moved our joint venture blue ammonia project with Mitsui into the FEED study phase. We believe that our focus on disciplined investments and partnerships with global leaders will keep us at the forefront of the developing market for low-carbon ammonia. 
We also remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the third quarter, we have brought our outstanding share count below 200 million for the first time on a stock split adjusted basis. Given the confidence we have for our continued high level of free cash generation going forward, along with the fact that our shares have an LTM free cash flow yield of over 19%, as shown on Slide 6 of our materials, we have established a new $3 billion share repurchase program to follow on after we complete our existing authorization. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market in more detail. Bert?"
22357184,1771540352,2673761,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

Agricultural-led demand continues to be robust due to the need to replenish global grain stocks. At the same time, energy prices in Europe and Asia have remained high, causing an unprecedented level of ammonia curtailments in Europe during the third quarter. 
Trade flows have adjusted rapidly with the rate of nitrogen imports into Europe over the last 3 months approaching those of the 2 largest import regions, India and Brazil. Foreign energy curve suggests that producers in Europe and Asia will face high energy costs into at least 2025. This will likely continue to challenge producer economics in those regions and lower global nitrogen supply availability. 
Producers in Europe with the option to import ammonia have been able to run upgrades profitably. But for those who cannot, the European winter is likely to be very difficult. Global supply also remains limited by government actions. Since October of 2021, Chinese government policy has materially restricted urea exports. Ammonia exports from Russia are also well below prior years. 
In contrast, the supply of upgraded fertilizer products from Russia has returned to near normal levels as trade flows have adjusted over the last 2 quarters. Looking ahead, we expect demand for nitrogen to remain resilient as the agriculture sector focuses on maximizing food production in the face of increasing food and security. Global harvests are not projected to make meaningful progress in 2022 towards rebuilding global grain stocks, as key producing regions suffered from poor weather during the growing season. 
This includes the U.S. where crops were negatively affected by extended heat and drought this summer, leading to yields that are expected to be significantly below trend. As a result, crop futures prices for corn remained strong relative to the last decade, which should incentivize farmers to apply nitrogen fertilizer to maximize yields in 2023. As we have seen so far this year, margin opportunities can shift rapidly between regions where product is needed most. 
Typical seasonal demand from India and Brazil and higher-than-usual demand from Europe continue to drive today's market. This has enabled CF to build our largest export book ever, and we are receiving strong interest for first quarter export shipments as well. Further out, we expect high corn and wheat planted acres in North America in 2023 due to strong crop futures prices and healthy farm economics. 
In line with this outlook, we have a strong order book for the fall ammonia application season which has begun. Low water levels on the Mississippi River have challenged the industry's ability to move product northward late in the year and will have an impact into 2023. This is likely to increase the importance and value of product manufactured in and close to the corn belt as we enter 2023. 
As you can see on Slide 11, we expect these broad industry supply and demand dynamics to continue to support a steep global nitrogen cost curve during 2023 and, in our view, well beyond. The wide estimated cost range suggests continued volatility in global nitrogen prices. With our manufacturing network firmly rooted at the low end of the cost curve, we are well positioned for a strong margin opportunities even as prices fluctuate. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the third quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $438 million or $2.18 per diluted share, EBITDA was $826 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $983 million. For the first 9 months of the year, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $2.5 billion or $12.04 per diluted share. EBITDA was $4.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 billion. 
As we look ahead, we believe we are well positioned across our business and strategic initiatives. Based on remaining planned maintenance activities, we expect capital expenditures for 2022 to be around $500 million, at the low end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year. This total encompasses expenditures related to our clean energy initiatives, including acquiring the land in Louisiana for the proposed blue ammonia plant with Mitsui. 
We have initiated a FEED study for the project with and we expect a final investment decision in the second half of 2023. We also took a substantial step forward with our carbon capture project at the Donaldsonville complex partnering with ExxonMobil and gaining the benefit of their unparalleled expertise in subsurface geology. Once operational, up to 2 million tons of carbon dioxide annually will be transported from Donaldsonville and sequestered rather than admitted, putting us well on track to meet our 2030 emissions intensity reduction goal. 
We expect sequestration to begin in early 2025, in line with the anticipated completion of the $200 million carbon dioxide dehydration and compression unit we are constructing. Given our installed assets in place and the enhanced 45Q tax credit and the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect to earn returns well above our cost of capital. We believe our agreement with ExxonMobil represents critical progress in the development of the market for low-carbon ammonia. 
In a little over 2 years, we expect to have completed the carbon dioxide infrastructure necessary to produce blue ammonia. This should give industries interested in using low-carbon blue ammonia for clean energy greater certainty that substantial volumes will soon be available. Our clean energy initiatives continue to have a very attractive return profile with projected expenditures representing only a modest outlay of capital compared to our free cash generation outlook. 
This will enable us to pursue additional growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria as well as continue to return capital to shareholders. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have repurchased more than 20 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion through both ratable and opportunistic repurchases. This is almost 10% of CF Industries share count from 1 year ago. 
On Slide 6, you can see our free cash flow yield and free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion rate. Based on these metrics, we see our shares as undervalued and expect to maintain a robust share repurchase program. We anticipate completing the remainder of the current repurchase authorization in the near future. At that point, we'll begin the new $3 billion share repurchase program. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

And you hit on probably one of the important subjects that we in the production side of the sector need to look at as well as the distribution side and that is these changing trade flows. And so what used to come out of Russia, let's say, 2-plus million tons of ammonia or different places is needing to be replaced on top of the lack of production coming out of Europe, at least in Q3, with gas prices remaining above $50. 
So you've had a substantial amount of supply taken off the market and CF as well as others have had to step in and replace those tons. But it's also reflected in urea and UAN as Russian tons head more towards South America and Middle Eastern and North African tons as well as North American tons are heading to Europe. And so those trade flows are reflected in additional vessel time and costs of logistics as well as the cost of the products. 
And so when we're looking at the trade flows, our assumptions are, and we're receiving, as I said in my prepared remarks, requests and outright bids for product to be supplied in Q1, and we expect this dynamic to continue through 2023 and probably 2024,  and we are geared up for that. We have changed some of our flows to accommodate that, always mindful, though, of our North American customers and the ability to supply that. 
And so that's why we did the fill program early in July to take care of our North American customers and meet their needs or what they're willing to commit to and then be more aggressive in the export market."

And you're right, the river issue with -- it's not just the Mississippi, but it's the Arkansas, the Ohio, the Illinois that are limiting shipments and water levels are at 30-year lows. So barges are not only being light loaded, they're taking double the amount of time and then to merge on those barges. 
So the cost of moving a ton from NOLA to  Midwest by barge went from, let's say, $15 to $70. So that's why when we say the value of internal tons like our Port Neal or our Canadian tons or Inland tons in North America are going to be valued and needed, and we're working with our customers to move those tons as we speak."

So  the value of our in-market production, distribution assets is really spotlighted during periods of logistics, discontinuities, and we're seeing that today, both in terms of river but also just normal rail service rates even if there's not a strike. 
So as Bert said, we're very pleased with where we've got product position, what our production looks like in market. And with Donaldsonville, where it is, we certainly have the options to be able to continue to export and access the European market, which is really short nitrogen. And so we're happy to be able to satisfy some of those requirements and needs over there. 
Relative to, I would just say, the differences in margin opportunities, Bert does a great job of optimizing product mix in order to maximize margin opportunity. So right now, as you look at the value of ammonia versus where urea is or UAN, he twist the dials and we move toward the products with better margins per unit of nitrogen. And in a lot of cases, then that leads to opportunities for export and  really to set us up for a great end of the year and a good year next year."

Our in-market plants because they're already in market, a lot of them have access to just do truck delivery and don't require significant rail outbound loadings. 
And so we're in a really good position relative to not only capturing that in-market spread because of the high cost of bringing imported product into the corn belt, but also given our logistics and distribution network and our storage capacity, we're relatively unaffected by a rail strike, but that would have dire consequences for the rest of the industry and anyone who's counting on bringing imported tons in is real trouble in the event of both the combination of low river levels along with the potential rail strike."

I mean I think what we're seeing right now is there clearly is some level of demand destruction. And I would say, most prominently on the industrial side in Europe, where you've got very high energy costs and it's well publicized that BASF and others are running facilities at greatly reduced rates. And so -- and that really has to happen in this environment because you don't have enough nitrogen to go around. So price tends to be a good arbiter of where the value sits and what things don't get it. And so that's necessary. 
But as you point out, we don't expect high operating rates in Europe based on where the forward gas curve is and at least where current product pricing is. So that's further going to constrain supply going forward. And that really calls into question or highlights potential food and security issues and some of the most vulnerable parts of the world. So that's a real challenge as we look at high energy costs and relatively lower operating rates. 
And we're conscious of that and trying to navigate that. But from our standpoint, given where the strategic location of Donaldsonville is, we do have the option of exporting it. And we'll sell those tons domestically if the price is attractive relative to other options. And if Europe is a more attractive option for us and are paying higher prices, then I think price is the best arbiter of who values the tons the most, and they ought to
So we're aware of it. But I think that's one of the reasons why we're fairly bullish as we look forward. The outlook of high energy costs in Europe and Asia means lower operating rates. They still need the product given where grain markets are and grain stocks to use are. So we expect very strong agricultural-led demand and a tight supply/demand balance on nitrogen, and that's why we're so bullish about the go forward."

It's been very interesting to watch their various governmental policies over the last several years from massive expansions and capacity to ramping that production down and becoming a basic domestic supplier, especially of urea, going from 13 million tons a few years ago to 5 and now down to 1.5. So a dramatic change that has tightened up the global S&D. But ammonium sulfate has been a surprise. That's come out in multiple millions of tons. And ammonium sulfate is a good fertilizer because you're combining nitrogen and sulfur to sulfur deficient areas. 
So it's been -- a lot of those tons have moved to South America as well as to Europe and have replaced some of the urea and ammonium nitrate tons in Europe. So we expect that to continue. Those haven't been sanctioned by the government and they have come out, and that's probably reflect -- some of that production is a reflection of caprolactam. Other is a reflection of pollution control equipment to make that product. And so it's been a surprise, yes, and we expect it to continue."

And then also just kind of on the expansion project side, like they had a few listed there the next 2 to 3 years.

The one difference is probably a little lower on the ammonia side because a lot of that ammonia used to go via pipeline down to Odessa or usually and then come out to the Black Sea and that route is not really available right now. So there is some reduction in ammonia exports. 
But as you point out, the other forms of nitrogen are pretty flat year-on-year. And our expectation is that their operating rate at least for the next year or so is going to be fairly consistent. I think it's really dependent upon how long the conflict goes on and how long you see various sanctions in place. At the moment, we're not counting on there being a big fall off of Russian ton availability due to maintenance problems. 
On the new plant build, our expectation is those plants once they've begun will eventually start up, but they will likely be delayed for a significant amount of time. And so I think it's fair to push start up on a lot of those plants back at least 18 months, if not 2 years. But again, our expectation is that they start up. And also, the world really is in a deficit situation right now with respect to the normal demand growth in nitrogen year-on-year and the amount of production capacity coming online. 
So ultimately, the world really does need those plants to  show up, particularly when we start seeing alternative uses of low-carbon ammonia, whether it's as a marine fuel or as co-combustion for electricity generation with coal. Historically, those demand areas have not required ammonia. And if we see those things develop and start pulling away available ammonia, we really do need those new plants to start up. So our expectation is that Russia is, for the most part, status quo with a little bit of delay on the new stuff."

Maybe Bert, what would you think if the Togliatti pipeline comes back online? What would that do for ammonia in the world? Number two, Martin always like to yell about Q3 politely though, but Q3 ammonia netbacks tend to be weaker because of the heavy industrial mix. You had some quite weak urea and UAN prices relative to so benchmarks. Can you talk about -- was that just the export dynamic there? 
And number three, the $3 billion buyback over 3 years, it's a good number. Can you talk about, Tony, why is that the right number? What the Board was thinking about all the different commitments and how you got to $3 billion for over 3 years?"

We know that there have been some efforts to rail those tons to northern ports. That's a very difficult situation to take on, one, you need additional railcars, then move additional miles that had to go through different facilities. And it's an intricate bringing together of many different components.  
Will the pipeline come back up? That is a big question. It's a very long pipeline. It's an old pipeline, and you're in the middle of a war zone. So all those positive factors would say that's going to be a pretty difficult enterprise to bring back up to its former operating rate. So those 2 million tons that have moved pretty consistently over the years, I think should be questioned. Is it 1 million tons? Is it just a pigging of the line? We have to wait and see. 
And when you look at the Q3 netbacks, you're right. When you look at the -- let's just take each of the 3. On ammonia, it is an industrial quarter. And so when you look at the volume of tons and the commitments we have to Mosaic and other industrial users that are many gas based, I think our number is extraordinary because on the percentage that is at cost plus against the percentage that is at market price, we averaged very well. 
And when you're looking at urea, as the next question you had,  the low of urea for Q3 was $485 entering Q3. And so as you know, for urea, you're asking our customers to sit on those tons for up to 8 months. And so there is a working capital issue and expense issue that goes to buying those tons, and they do get discounted and the interior, they get discounted as well. And that's just something we work through with our customers over time. 
And so when you look at our average price, again, starting at a very low level and probably hitting a peak, the peak of pricing was late in September. And so that will be reflected in Q4. So I like our Q3, both ammonia and urea numbers. I think UAN was fantastic at the numbers we had there when we started ammonia filled at $400 and average $448 has a good team effort there."

And I would just tag on with that one. Joel, back to Martin's point that he's spot on. Q3 is our lowest quarter from an ag demand perspective because the Northern Hemisphere is not applying and everything for the most part is going into inventory. And so really, it's also proportionally our largest industrial quarter. And as he points out, right, we saw whether it's the Mosaic contract or other industrial contracts that we have, those don't trade typically at the same level as ag demand does, particularly ag demand in season. 
And so you got to make sure when you're thinking about third quarter, you take those factors into consideration. But I'm with Bert, I'm really pleased with our price realization, our volume. I mean, $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA is the strongest third quarter we've ever had by a long shot. And that really lead us into the second part of your question, which is $3 billion, why is that the right number. 
And I would just say, over the last 12 months, we've done $1.6 billion of share repo. And we're nearing the -- closing out the existing repurchase authorization that we have. And so we want to make sure that we got another authorization in place so we didn't have any dead period in there. And this is one of those things that it's going to be a rinse and repeat, not this is the end of it, right? 
So if things develop the way we expect them to and how we're seeing the first half develop, we could easily finish that well faster than the 3-year time horizon that it's on, and then we'd go back and layer on another one on top of it. But  the good news here is based on energy differentials and based on where stocks to use are, we see a prolonged period of very significant cash flow generation for the business without huge CapEx requirements. 
And so it really gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of how we think about deploying capital and returning capital to shareholders. And I'm just excited about what that means for the future."

The other issue is in some parts of the world, less so in North America and Europe, but there's also a big working capital commitment at the current levels of nitrogen pricing out there in order to build a position for next year. 
So I think people tend to live a little bit more hand to mouth on that. But there's still plenty of demand, as you say, based on where grain prices are, we think ag demand is going to be very strong as we head into next year. And we're very optimistic about where that goes."

And even though we're heading into a recession, the products that are demanded from us, the ammonia, nitric acid for synthetic fibers or explosives for mining are all very positive. And so for end demand, I look at the forward and that goes back to the cost curve. There are regions that are going to be cost constrained. 
And so then you lay in the demand that's expected, that still keeps the market tight, and that's why we're operating in this level of pricing of $1,000 for ammonia when a year ago, we were at $600.

And this was not the view that was public. But as we followed the trade case, we kept inventories in anticipation of spring demand that didn't show up. So we were long UAN. And so through Q3, we worked that down to a very good level. Yes, we did export, but we also shipped to the interior. We've also prepared for fall application of ammonia, which is now taking place and positioned ourselves very well to meet our customers' expectations into December.  
Urea, I think that's probably maybe on the lighter side of inventory. And I think that's where the river and for UAN, the river issues are having an impact of an inability to move NOLA tons up or the cost to move them up. And that's something we're watching. And that's why we're acquiring additional railcars, so we can move Dville tons by rail if needed, as well as Port Neal and Medicine Hat, Alberta. 
But transitioning to the rest of the world, there are areas where inventory is high. But the reason that they're high in Europe is Europe was not set up to be a very large importer. And so you're structurally trying to do something very quickly that the system was not built to do. And so those import facilities, they are a little bit plugged. They also had low river issues and an inability to fully load barges, but they also don't have a rail system like ours set up to quickly move tons into the interior. 
So structural issues are limiting the movement of product. And I think that's going to be an issue for them. There are a lot of North African tons that were moved into Europe. So I would actually say they were plugged for a while. UAN is a little bit different. We're moving some UAN over there, and that's been moving fairly efficiently. Brazil is another issue. There were as well as Santos and they were all inundated with imports, and there's been some trucker issues, some trucker strikes, and they're not set up for rail on a grand scale like we are in the United States. 
And so vessels have been lining up and waiting record numbers of days, and that's going to cost money. I do think they'll make it though. However, Brazil is constantly working through their issues and very creative in their -- how they solve those issues.  But they need 600,000 to 700,000 tons a month and into February to meet the requirements. I think they'll do that, but it will be probably more expensive."

And so as I just with the last caller talked about there are areas of the world that are high demand areas that are plugged and have an inability to receive new tons. So what has happened, that has happened into NOLA. 
And with the difficulties of the river system, a lot of traders and buyers have wanted to get out of their positions and they just sold them down to a level that we believe is artificially low. And guess what happened? This week, we saw a $50 rebound because those tons now may be going to India because India did a surprise tender announcement today. And so this is a dynamic market, and this is what the beauty of the CF system of our ability to pivot very quickly, participate in all these different markets have the spread of the distribution terminals and the flexibility. 
You have to remember, we have 5 different modes to ship, pipe, barge, rail, truck and vessel. That gives a lot of flexibility. So that's why we believe our pricing structure is consistently at or better than the market. So our expectations are still the same. You have a product constrained market, a little bit of the demand deferral and demand destruction, but a need for the world to be fed and cloth. And that will only happen with nitrogen fertilizer being readily available, and that's the question we're heading into 2023 is how and when that will normalize. 
So the structured price, we would say where we are today and probably trending higher into 2023, and it's going to be a positive market next year."

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, our adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion and our free cash flow was a whopping $3.7 billion. Our industry-leading EBITDA to free cash flow conversion efficiency is an incredible 63%. These results reflect continued outstanding execution by the CF Industries team.
Our plants are running well, and we continue to leverage our distribution and logistics capabilities to navigate rapidly changing global environment. Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. At the end of the quarter, our 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.29 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, well below industry averages.
Our team's remarkable performance took place against the backdrop of a very tight global nitrogen supply-demand balance. As Bert will explain in a moment, we believe the dynamics underpinning this environment will remain in place for an extended period, namely strong agricultural-led demand and high energy prices in Europe and Asia.
Based on this outlook, we expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders. We remain focused on our clean energy growth initiatives, highlighted by the development of our blue ammonia capacity.
Most recently, we reached a landmark carbon capture and sequestration agreement with ExxonMobil for our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex. We have also moved our joint venture blue ammonia project with Mitsui into the FEED study phase. We believe that our focus on disciplined investments and partnerships with global leaders will keep us at the forefront of the developing market for low-carbon ammonia.
We also remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the end of the third quarter, we have brought our outstanding share count below 200 million for the first time on a stock-split adjusted basis. Given the confidence we have for our continued high level of free cash generation going forward, along with the fact that our shares have an LTM free cash flow yield of over 19%, as shown on Slide 6 of our materials, we have established a new $3 billion share repurchase program to follow on after we complete our existing authorization.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market in more detail. Bert?"

The operating environment for CF Industries remains positive as we near the end of 2022. Agricultural-led demand continues to be robust due to the need to replenish global grain stocks.

Agricultural-led demand continues to be robust due to the need to replenish global grain stocks. At the same time, energy prices in Europe and Asia have remained high, causing an unprecedented level of ammonia curtailments in Europe during the third quarter.
Trade flows have adjusted rapidly with the rate of nitrogen imports into Europe over the last 3 months approaching those of the 2 largest import regions, India and Brazil. Foreign energy curve suggests that producers in Europe and Asia will face high energy costs into at least 2025. This will likely continue to challenge producer economics in those regions and lower global nitrogen supply availability.
Producers in Europe with the option to import ammonia have been able to run upgrades profitably. But for those who cannot, the European winter is likely to be very difficult. Global supply also remains limited by government actions. Since October of 2021, Chinese government policy has materially restricted urea exports. Ammonia exports from Russia are also well below prior years. In contrast, the supply of upgraded fertilizer products from Russia has returned to near normal levels as trade flows have adjusted over the last 2 quarters.
Looking ahead, we expect demand for nitrogen to remain resilient as the agriculture sector focuses on maximizing food production in the face of increasing food and security. Global harvests are not projected to make meaningful progress in 2022 towards rebuilding global grain stocks, as key producing regions suffered from poor weather during the growing season. This includes the U.S. where crops were negatively affected by extended heat and drought this summer, leading to yields that are expected to be significantly below trend.
As a result, crop futures prices for corn remained strong relative to the last decade, which should incentivize farmers to apply nitrogen fertilizer to maximize yields in 2023. As we have seen so far this year, margin opportunities can shift rapidly between regions where product is needed most.
Typical seasonal demand from India and Brazil and higher-than-usual demand from Europe continue to drive today's market. This has enabled CF to build our largest export book ever, and we are receiving strong interest for first quarter export shipments as well. Further out, we expect high corn and wheat planted acres in North America in 2023 due to strong crop futures prices and healthy farm economics.
In line with this outlook, we have a strong order book for the fall ammonia application season which has begun. Low water levels on the Mississippi River have challenged the industry's ability to move product northward late in the year and will have an impact into 2023. This is likely to increase the importance and value of product manufactured in and close to the corn belt as we enter 2023.
As you can see on Slide 11, we expect these broad industry supply and demand dynamics to continue to support a steep global nitrogen cost curve during 2023 and, in our view, well beyond. The wide estimated cost range suggests continued volatility in global nitrogen prices. With our manufacturing network firmly rooted at the low end of the cost curve, we are well positioned for a strong margin opportunities even as prices fluctuate.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the third quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $438 million or $2.18 per diluted share.

For the third quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $438 million or $2.18 per diluted share. EBITDA was $826 million and adjusted EBITDA was $983 million. For the first 9 months of the year, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $2.5 billion or $12.04 per diluted share. EBITDA was $4.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 billion.
As we look ahead, we believe we are well positioned across our business and strategic initiatives. Based on remaining planned maintenance activities, we expect capital expenditures for 2022 to be around $500 million, at the low end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year. This total encompasses expenditures related to our clean energy initiatives, including acquiring the land in Louisiana for the proposed blue ammonia plant with Mitsui.
We have initiated a FEED study for the project with ThyssenKrupp and we expect a final investment decision in the second half of 2023. We also took a substantial step forward with our carbon capture project at the Donaldsonville Complex partnering with ExxonMobil and gaining the benefit of their unparalleled expertise in subsurface geology. Once operational, up to 2 million tons of carbon dioxide annually will be transported from Donaldsonville and sequestered rather than emitted, putting us well on track to meet our 2030 emissions intensity reduction goal.
We expect sequestration to begin in early 2025, in line with the anticipated completion of the $200 million carbon dioxide dehydration and compression unit we are constructing. Given our installed assets in place and the enhanced 45Q tax credit and the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect to earn returns well above our cost of capital. We believe our agreement with ExxonMobil represents critical progress in the development of the market for low-carbon ammonia.
In a little over 2 years, we expect to have completed the carbon dioxide infrastructure necessary to produce blue ammonia. This should give industries interested in using low-carbon blue ammonia for clean energy greater certainty that substantial volumes will soon be available. Our clean energy initiatives continue to have a very attractive return profile with projected expenditures representing only a modest outlay of capital compared to our free cash generation outlook.
This will enable us to pursue additional growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria as well as continue to return capital to shareholders. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have repurchased more than 20 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion through both ratable and opportunistic repurchases. This is almost 10% of CF Industries share count from 1 year ago.
On Slide 6, you can see our free cash flow yield and free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion rate. Based on these metrics, we see our shares as undervalued and expect to maintain a robust share repurchase program. We anticipate completing the remainder of the current repurchase authorization in the near future. At that point, we'll begin the new $3 billion share repurchase program.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

And so what used to come out of Russia, let's say, 2-plus million tons of ammonia or different places is needing to be replaced on top of the lack of production coming out of Europe, at least in Q3, with gas prices remaining above $50. So we've had a substantial amount of supply taken off the market and CF as well as others have had to step in and replace those tons. But it's also reflected in urea and UAN as Russian tons head more towards South America and Middle Eastern and North African tons as well as North American tons are heading to Europe. And so those trade flows are reflected in additional vessel time and costs of logistics as well as the cost of the products.
And so when we're looking at the trade flows, our assumptions are, and we're receiving, as I said in my prepared remarks, requests and outright bids for product to be supplied in Q1, and we expect this dynamic to continue through 2023 and probably 2024,  and we are geared up for that. We have changed some of our flows to accommodate that, always mindful, though, of our North American customers and the ability to supply that.

So the value of our in-market production, distribution assets is really spotlighted during periods of logistics discontinuities, and we're seeing that today, both in terms of river but also just normal rail service rates even if there's not a strike.
So as Bert said, we're very pleased with where we've got product position, what our production looks like in market. And with Donaldsonville, where it is, we certainly have the options to be able to continue to export and access the European market, which is really short nitrogen. And so we're happy to be able to satisfy some of those requirements and needs over there.
Relative to, I would just say, differences in margin opportunities, Bert does a great job of optimizing product mix in order to maximize margin opportunity. So right now, as you look at the value of ammonia versus where urea is or UAN, he twist the dials and we move toward the products with better margins per unit of nitrogen. And in a lot of cases, then that leads to opportunities for export and really to set us up for a great end of the year and a good year next year."

And so we're in a really good position relative to not only capturing that in-market spread because of the high cost of bringing imported product into the corn belt, but also given our logistics and distribution network and our storage capacity, we're relatively unaffected by a rail strike, but that would have dire consequences for the rest of the industry and anyone who's counting on bringing imported tons is in real trouble in the event of both the combination of low river levels along with the potential rail strike."

I mean I think what we're seeing right now is, there, clearly, is some level of demand destruction. And I would say, most prominently on the industrial side in Europe, where you've got very high energy costs and it's well publicized that BASF and others are running facilities at greatly reduced rates. And so -- and that really has to happen in this environment because you don't have enough nitrogen to go around. So price tends to be a good arbiter of where the value sits and what things don't get it. And so that's necessary.
But as you point out, we don't expect high operating rates in Europe based on where the forward gas curve is and at least where current product pricing is. So that's further going to constrain supply going forward. And that really calls into question or highlights potential food and security issues in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world. So that's a real challenge as we look at high energy costs and relatively lower operating rates.
And we're conscious of that and trying to navigate that. But from our standpoint, given where the strategic location of Donaldsonville is, we do have the option of exporting it. And we'll sell those tons domestically if the price is attractive relative to other options. And if Europe is a more attractive option for us and are paying higher prices, then I think price is the best arbiter of who values the tons the most, and they ought to get them.
So we're aware of it. But I think that's one of the reasons why we're fairly bullish as we look forward. The outlook of high energy costs in Europe and Asia means lower operating rates. They still need the product given where grain markets are and grain stocks to use are. So we expect very strong agricultural-led demand and a tight supply/demand balance on nitrogen, and that's why we're so bullish about the go forward."

It's been very interesting to watch their various governmental policies over the last several years from massive expansions and capacity to ramping that production down and becoming a basic domestic supplier, especially of urea, going from 13 million tons a few years ago to 5 million tons and now down to 1.5 million tons. So a dramatic change that has tightened up the global S&D. But ammonium sulfate has been a surprise. That's come out in multiple millions of tons. And ammonium sulfate is a good fertilizer because you're combining nitrogen and sulfur to sulfur deficient areas.
So it's been -- a lot of those tons have moved to South America as well as to Europe and have replaced some of the urea and ammonium nitrate tons in Europe. So we expect that to continue. Those haven't been sanctioned by the government and they have come out, and that's probably reflect -- some of that production is a reflection of caprolactam. Other is a reflection of pollution control equipment to make that product. And so it's been a surprise, yes, and we expect it to continue."

The one difference is probably a little lower on the ammonia side because a lot of that ammonia used to go via pipeline down to Odessa or usually and then come out to the Black Sea and that route is not really available right now. So there is some reduction in ammonia exports.
But as you point out, the other forms of nitrogen are pretty flat year-on-year. And our expectation is that their operating rate at least for the next year or so is going to be fairly consistent. I think it's really dependent upon how long the conflict goes on and how long you see various sanctions in place. At the moment, we're not counting on there being a big fall off of Russian ton availability due to maintenance problems.
On the new plant build, our expectation is those plants once they've begun will eventually start up, but they will likely be delayed for a significant amount of time. And so I think it's fair to push start up on a lot of those plants back at least 18 months, if not 2 years. But again, our expectation is that they start up. And also, the world really is in a deficit situation right now with respect to the normal demand growth in nitrogen year-on-year and the amount of production capacity coming online.
So ultimately, the world really does need those plants to show up, particularly when we start seeing alternative uses of low-carbon ammonia, whether it's as a marine fuel or as co-combustion for electricity generation with coal. Historically, those demand areas have not required ammonia. And if we see those things develop and start pulling away available ammonia, we really do need those new plants to start up. So our expectation is that Russia is, for the most part, status quo with a little bit of delay on the new stuff."

Maybe Bert, what would you think if the Togliatti pipeline comes back online? What would that do for ammonia in the world? Number two, Martin always like to yell about Q3 politely though, but Q3 ammonia netbacks tend to be weaker because of the heavy industrial mix. You had some quite weak urea and UAN prices relative to so benchmarks. Can you talk about -- was that just the export dynamic there?
And number three, the $3 billion buyback over 3 years, it's a good number. Can you talk about, Tony, why is that the right number? What the Board was thinking about all the different commitments and how you got to $3 billion for over 3 years?"

We know that there have been some efforts to rail those tons to northern ports. That's a very difficult situation to take on, one, you need additional railcars, then move additional miles that had to go through different facilities. And it's an intricate bringing together of many different components.
Will the pipeline come back up? That is a big question. It's a very long pipeline. It's an old pipeline, and you're in the middle of a war zone. So all those positive factors would say that's going to be a pretty difficult enterprise to bring back up to its former operating rate. So those 2 million tons that have moved pretty consistently over the years, I think should be questioned. Is it 1 million tons? Is it just a pigging of the line? We have to wait and see.
And when you look at the Q3 netbacks, you're right. When you look at the -- let's just take each of the 3. On ammonia, it is an industrial quarter. And so when you look at the volume of tons and the commitments we have to Mosaic and other industrial users that are many gas based, I think our number is extraordinary because on the percentage that is at cost plus against the percentage that is at market price, we averaged very well.
And when you're looking at urea, as the next question you had,  the low of urea for Q3 was $485 entering Q3. And so as you know, for urea, you're asking our customers to sit on those tons for up to 8 months. And so there is a working capital issue and an expense issue that goes to buying those tons, and they do get discounted and the interior, they get discounted as well. And that's just something we work through with our customers over time.
And so when you look at our average price, again, starting at a very low level and probably hitting a peak, the peak of pricing was late in September. And so that will be reflected in Q4. So I like our Q3, both ammonia and urea numbers. I think UAN was fantastic at the numbers we had there when we started ammonia filled at $400 and average $448 that's a good team effort there."

And I would just tag on with that one. Joel, back to Martin's point that he's spot on. Q3 is our lowest quarter from an ag demand perspective because the Northern Hemisphere is not applying and everything for the most part is going into inventory. And so really, it's also proportionally our largest industrial quarter. And as he points out, rightly so, whether it's the Mosaic contract or other industrial contracts that we have, those don't trade typically at the same level as ag demand does, particularly ag demand in season.
And so you got to make sure when you're thinking about third quarter, you take those factors into consideration. But I'm with Bert, I'm really pleased with our price realization, our volume. I mean, $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA is the strongest third quarter we've ever had by a long shot. And that really leads us into the second part of your question, which is $3 billion, why is that the right number.
And I would just say, over the last 12 months, we've done $1.6 billion of share repo. And we're nearing the -- closing out the existing repurchase authorization that we have. And so we want to make sure that we got another authorization in place so we didn't have any dead period in there. And this is one of those things that it's going to be a rinse and repeat, not this is the end of it, right?
So if things develop the way we expect them to and how we're seeing the first half develop, we could easily finish that well faster than the 3-year time horizon that it's on, and then we'd go back and layer on another one on top of it. But the good news here is based on energy differentials and based on where stocks to use are, we see a prolonged period of very significant cash flow generation for the business without huge CapEx requirements. And so it really gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of how we think about deploying capital and returning capital to shareholders. And I'm just excited about what that means for the future."

I think what we're seeing is that that's a tough situation or potentially a tough situation given where energy prices are in the rest of the world. The other issue is in some parts of the world, less so in North America and Europe, but there's also a big working capital commitment at the current levels of nitrogen pricing out there in order to build a position for next year.
So I think people tend to live a little bit more hand to mouth on that. But there's still plenty of demand, as you say, based on where grain prices are, we think ag demand is going to be very strong as we head into next year. And we're very optimistic about where that goes."

And even though we're heading into a recession, the products that are demanded from us, the ammonia, nitric acid for synthetic fibers or explosives for mining are all very positive. And so for end demand, I look at the forward and that goes back to the cost curve. There are regions that are going to be cost constrained.
And so then you lay in the demand that's expected, that still keeps the market tight, and that's why we're operating in this level of pricing of $1,000 for ammonia when a year ago, we were at $600.

We've talked about at length the Mosaic contract and others. And honestly, having $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter is absolutely fantastic. We launched fill at the highest price we've ever launched at and realized prices well above that. We had a fairly muted fill program because we saw the demand for that product internationally. And I'd tell you $1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter is absolutely outstanding. There's nothing I'm disappointed or apologetic about it all."

And I'm sure you have visibility into your wholesale and retail customers. How would you assess their inventory levels right now versus normal so that would be the U.S. comment or question? There's some comments out there that Europe has full inventory levels of urea. I'm not sure that's logical, but would to hear your view on that one?

And this was not the view that was public. But as we followed the trade case, we kept inventories in anticipation of spring demand that didn't show up. So we were long UAN. And so through Q3, we worked that down to a very good level. Yes, we did export, but we also shipped to the interior. We've also prepared for fall application of ammonia, which is now taking place and positioned ourselves very well to meet our customers' expectations into December.
Urea, I think that's probably maybe on the lighter side of inventory. And I think that's where the river, and for UAN, the river issues are having an impact of an inability to move NOLA tons up or the cost to move them up. And that's something we're watching. And that's why we're acquiring additional railcars, so we can move Dville tons by rail if needed, as well as Port Neal and Medicine Hat, Alberta.
But transitioning to the rest of the world, there are areas where inventory is high. But the reason that they're high in Europe is Europe was not set up to be a very large importer. And so you're structurally trying to do something very quickly that the system was not built to do. And so those import facilities, they are a little bit plugged. They also had low river issues and an inability to fully load barges, but they also don't have a rail system like ours set up to quickly move tons into the interior.
So structural issues are limiting the movement of product. And I think that's going to be an issue for them. There are a lot of North African tons that were moved into Europe. So I would actually say they were plugged for a while. UAN is a little bit different. We're moving some UAN over there, and that's been moving fairly efficiently. Brazil is another issue. There were Paranaguá as well as Santos and Rio Grande. They were all inundated with imports, and there's been some trucker issues, some trucker strikes, and they're not set up for rail on a grand scale like we are in the United States.
And so vessels have been lining up and waiting record numbers of days, and that's going to cost money. I do think they'll make it though. However, Brazil is constantly working through their issues and very creative in their -- how they solve those issues.  But they need 600,000 to 700,000 tons a month, Nov, Dec, Jan and into February to meet the safrina requirements. I think they'll do that, but it will be probably more expensive."

So given now everything you've talked about in terms of the logistical constraints, be it the rivers, be it the potential rail strike and so on, plus what's over up Russia, et cetera, how do you think about the structure price going forward? And how do you think the structure price and the realized price is going to align over time?
And also, if you could explain maybe a little bit why the current price, at least NOLA seems to be below the levels of last year, but it seems like there's much more friction in the system this year versus a year ago? So just to understand a little bit the actual pricing environment versus some of the commentary you made around the structure price."

We're in a commodity business. In a commodity business, that's not board traded. That is determined at different pricing points, whether that would be NOLA, Paranaguá or in the Middle East are dependent on different things. And so as I just with the last caller talked about there are areas of the world that are high demand areas that are plugged and have an inability to receive new tons. So what has happened, that has happened into NOLA.
And with the difficulties of the river system, a lot of traders and buyers have wanted to get out of their positions and they just sold them down to a level that we believe is artificially low. And guess what happened? This week, we saw a $50 rebound because those tons now may be going to India because India did a surprise tender announcement today. And so this is a dynamic market, and this is what the beauty of the CF system of our ability to pivot very quickly, participate in all these different markets, have the spread of the distribution terminals and the flexibility.
You have to remember, we have 5 different modes to ship, pipe, barge, rail, truck and vessel. That gives a lot of flexibility. So that's why we believe our pricing structure is consistently at or better than the market. So our expectations are still the same. You have a product constrained market, a little bit of the demand deferral and demand destruction, but a need for the world to be fed and clothed. And that will only happen with nitrogen fertilizer being readily available, and that's the question mark heading into 2023 is how and when that will normalize. So the structured price, we would say where we are today and probably trending higher into 2023, and it's going to be a positive market next year."
