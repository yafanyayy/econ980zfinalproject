You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done",1042,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done with COVID in 2021, the recent Omicron surge is a reminder that we aren't quite at the end yet, although I sure hope we're close. 
So our business grew 25% in revenue despite the waves of Delta and more recently, Omicron. And this latest Omicron surge has impacted peak season behaviors and dating sentiment in parts of the world. And because these surges have had glaring effects on our business, I thought I would start by sort of level-setting where our business is in the context of the pandemic. 
So if you recall, back in 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, our business took a hit during the global lockdowns, and it then stabilized by late spring. And at that time, both user activity and propensity to pay slowly recovered. And as we've dealt with different waves of COVID since, usually, the mobility restrictions are generally impacted dating activity. And now fast forward 2 years, while much of the Western markets, including the U.S., are seeing less and less impact to activity and propensity to pay with these ongoing surges, several markets, particularly in Asia, are still disproportionately impacted. 
Japan, for instance, has now dealt with 3 periods of state of emergency last year, all of which had, had a meaningful impact to mobility and general dating sentiment. And there seems to be a glimmer of hope after that last one was lifted. But again, Omicron has them back in a quasi state of emergency at least until February 20. And all of this has led to a level of anxiety and fatigue, particularly in these winter months, and we're seeing the effects of this in Japan and parts of Asia. 
Now beyond these geographic differences, as we've said before a few times, while active online daters and propensity to metrics have largely recovered in Western markets, there is still a hesitancy among new users who have never tried dating apps before to break into the category. Now these are usually largely driven by word of mouth, and that, of course, depends on normal levels of socializing, which hasn't yet happened. And if you've resisted online dating until now, the pandemic hardly seems the right time to start. So this past year, we have seen periodic uptakes in new entrants when COVID is not dominating the new cycle. But by and large, that has not fully recovered in a sustained way. 
So unlike categories like, say, online groceries, for instance, where pandemic pulled forward new users, for us, nonusers breaking into the category, even at a normal cadence, is still to come. And we feel optimistic that if Omicron truly is what causes the shift from a pandemic to endemic, and if things do indeed return to more normal in spring and summer, we are well positioned to be able to capitalize on it. We've made a significant progress in building out our portfolio of products that appeal to different demographics and intent. We've innovated on many pain points, everything from trust and safety to more authentic discovery and getting to know each other experiences. We've been disciplined and measured in our marketing efforts given the macro climate, but we're ready with several creative and optimistic campaigns to reenergize dating sentiment as soon as we are in a new post-pandemic normal. Romance and love maybe just the thing that shakes us out of this collective malaise. 
Now Tinder, beyond a 22% revenue growth, in 2021, Tinder released its biggest update since the invention of the Swipe feature, and this was the launch of Tinder Explore. Explore provides Tinder with additional flexibility to expand use cases to more dimensions of discovery and social live experiences. Explore enhances responsiveness, offers surface and opportunity for regionally tailored experiences; has exciting media, video dating hybrids such as Swipe Night, wedding dates, concert festival mode; and it's clearly had a productive start with almost 70% of users adopting this experience. The 2022 road map has many more enhancements planned, along with new monetization opportunities later in the year. 
Hinge. Hinge has had an impressive year where they've more than doubled revenue. They're also seeing a strong start to 2022 in markets they've been around at, like the U.K. and Australia. And the voice prompts feature they launched late last year has really resonated with users, not to mention the social virality this have seen. Turns out people's life goals, dating styles and their best dad jokes are both entertaining and insightful. Our 2022 plan for Hinge, to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets, remains intact. 
We're also making progress at Hyperconnect and stabilizing the core business, and we plan to return them to growth later this year. They have recently launched a Azar lounge, their live streaming feature, and Hakuna [ city ], their interactive and immersive new discovery experience. And they continue to experiment with metaverse elements, both in dating and social discovery context. 
We've also successfully integrated Hyperconnect's live video and audio tech on a couple of our platforms. And the teams are making progress, enabling our other brands to leverage their technology more broadly to build new immersive discovery and live experiences. While much remains to be done at Hyperconnect, we're actually very confident it is on the right track, and it is pushing us forward in a number of areas that are critical to our long-term growth. 
As I reflect on last year, what jumps out to me has been ability to find opportunities in the face of uncertainty. And despite this latest Omicron surge and all the uncertainty it may create over the next couple of months, I am hopeful about 2022, how we're going to use technology and innovate product experiences; tell our story with ever more creative marketing; and most importantly, profoundly change many more lives around the world. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some color on the quarter and the full year."

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year.

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened meaningfully against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $12 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, total revenue would have been $818 million, up 26% year-over-year. We did not anticipate about $9 million of FX headwind when we provided our outlook in early November. 
Our direct revenue grew 24% year-over-year. It grew 21% in the Americas, an acceleration from last quarter; 16% in Europe; and 46% in APAC and Other. We did feel some COVID impacts on our business, particularly from the emergence of the Omicron variant, which severely reduced mobility in a number of markets starting in December. COVID continues to be a meaningful overhang on our Japanese business and in certain other markets. 
Total payers were 16.2 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 10% year-over-year in both the Americas and Europe, and 36% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. 
RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.16 in Q4. RPP was up a solid 10% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 7% in APAC and Other. Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $444 million, up 23% year-over-year, an acceleration over Q3's rate. Tinder had payers' growth of 18% year-over-year, adding 1.6 million payers to 10.6 million, an RPP growth of 4% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Tinder Platinum subscribers comprised approximately 13% of total Tinder subscribers, exceeding 1 million in aggregate. Tinder active user growth continues to be strong, with the brand achieving a record number of active users on its platform globally in 2021. Engagement on the platform also continues to be robust with several KPIs such as daily swipes and messages at or near all-time highs in Q4. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 26% year-over-year in Q4, driven by 16% RPP growth and 9% payers' growth. Hinge was the standout among this group, growing direct revenue approximately 90% year-over-year, driven by RPP growth of 60% to nearly $24 and reaching about 850,000 payers. BLK [ see spun upward ] in aggregate grew direct revenue over 70% year-over-year in Q4. 
Hyperconnect contributed about $50 million of total revenue in the quarter. The business saw improved performance in December compared to preceding months. It was also significantly impacted in the quarter by FX, especially against the Turkish lira as Turkey is a large market for Hyperconnect. 
Indirect revenue reached $18 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. This was off a very strong Q4 2020. Q4 operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $232 million for margins of 29%. And adjusted operating income, which we formally called adjusted EBITDA, grew 18% year-over-year to $290 million for margins of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins would have been 2.5 points higher, excluding Hyperconnect. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, with slightly less than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 21% year-over-year, primarily due to higher IAP fees and represented 28% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $12 million as we pulled back marketing spend across our portfolio to maintain our ROI discipline in a crowded holiday marketing environment. That did have some impact on payers, especially in our marketing-heavy brands like Match. 
Sales and marketing spend was down 5 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%. G&A expense excluding Hyperconnect, rose 38% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in legal fees. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 2 points or $28 million year-over-year. G&A was less than we had anticipated as the former Tinder employee litigation came to a conclusion on December 1. 
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 31% year-over-year and were 8% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, primarily Tinder. Our gross leverage declined to 3.7x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.9x at the end of Q4, achieving the target of below 3x that we set at the time of our separation. We ended the quarter with $827 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We have agreed to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations. We expect to pay this amount from cash on hand in Q1 2022. 
For full year 2022, we expect the company to deliver 15% to 20% year-over-year growth, driven by another strong year for both Tinder, where we expect high-teens year-over-year growth and Hinge. Our outlook includes approximately $85 million of negative year-over-year FX impacts on total revenue. That's approximately $60 million worse than what we expected at the time of our last earnings call in early November, which is about 2 points of growth. 
In addition to the FX impact, our revenue growth outlook is more conservative than what we shared in early November due to continued COVID impact, especially in Asia and particularly the rise of the Omicron variant, which is impacting us in the early goings of 2022. Keep in mind that we have a global business. And while we may be getting ready to move past Omicron in the U.S. and Europe, Asia still has to get through that period. So we expect our performance will continue to be somewhat impacted likely until sometime in Q2. 
In aggregate, our '22 revenue outlook has been reduced by about 3 points of growth since November due to the FX and COVID impacts. Our revenue outlook for 2022 also assumes momentum builds in the second half of the year. There remains much uncertainty about what happens next with the pandemic, but we have increased confidence that while the first part of 2022 may be tougher than we initially anticipated, the second half could be stronger. We're hopeful that once we get past the effects of Omicron, we could even have that summer of love that we had expected back in 2021 after the vaccines were introduced. 
We expect overall company margins to be roughly flat, inclusive of Hyperconnect, which we expect to be better than breakeven in 2022. For the full year, we expect 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement, excluding Hyperconnect, as we incur lower year-over-year legal expenses and lower fees on Google subscriptions, which we plan to partially reinvest in safety and CSR initiatives as well as higher employee costs given the ongoing war for talent. 
Note that despite Google's recent fee cut, which covered only subscription revenue, we actually expect to pay a greater percentage of our revenue to the app stores in 2022 than in 2021 as more of our users come in via app. For instance, on our fast-growing Hinge app, most payers use iOS, and we pay a full 30% on that revenue. 
Our margin outlook reflects current app store policies. Our outlook includes over $650 million of App Store fees in 2022, primarily to Apple. Our outlook does not include implementation of Google's previously announced requirement of mandatory use of its payment system starting in April 2022. Were that to happen, we incur approximately $50 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. Even though we're unable to forecast further change in App Store policies at this time, we remain optimistic that more changes to the App Store ecosystem are likely, and we will continue to update you. 
For full year 2022, we expect SBC expense of $175 million to $185 million, reflecting additional hiring and the continued competitive market for talent. CapEx of approximately $70 million, about $10 million lower than in 2021 and adjusted operating income to free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, excluding the $441 million legal settlement. We do not expect to be a material U.S. federal cash taxpayer in 2022. 
We have an initiative underway in countries where Tinder still offers age-based discounts to eliminate these discounts. These changes, which have begun in earnest in Q1, will impact Tinder payers beginning in Q1, but we expect these changes to be revenue neutral. For Q1, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by year-over-year payers growth in the low to mid-teens and year-over-year RPP growth in the mid-single digits, as is typical for us. However, the effects from Omicron could shift these metrics somewhat. We anticipate about $25 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q1, meaning that growth would be more than 4 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. 
We expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to be in the high teens in Q1 and that Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver direct revenue growth over 70% year-over-year in Q1. We anticipate that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q1 at similar levels to Q4 '21. 
We expect adjusted operating income of $260 million to $265 million in Q1, representing margins in the low-30s percent range, typical for a first quarter for us despite about 2.5 points of pressure from adding Hyperconnect. 
Our company has all the ingredients to continue to deliver on our mission of helping people make meaningful connections through our technology. Tinder has an exciting product road map and a growing global user base to continue to convert. Hinge's product continues to gain traction and the business has meaningful opportunities ahead, including in many international markets. There is so much we can do with Hyperconnect, not only deploy their video and audio tech capabilities across our apps, but have them help us build exciting new Metaverse dating apps and immersive user experiences, which we can potentially make use of across our portfolio. Our financial performance is strong with room to grow already best-in-class margins and potential App Store reform benefits. We strongly believe that the next phase of our business is going to be very exciting. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

First of all, as I said, our outlook for margins for this year, inclusive of Hyperconnect, is that they'd be relatively flat, which we actually think is a strong performance, especially in this environment. And Hyperconnect contributes over 1 point of margin headwind for the year. 
If you look through the puts and takes, we probably have a bit over 2 points, I would say, of margin improvement from legal expense savings and Google's reduction from 30% to 15% on subscriptions. But we're currently forecasting that we could reinvest more than half of that savings into hiring new people and in retaining our existing talent, especially in the very competitive market that we're operating in for talent right now. 
We also plan to reinvest some of the -- for some of the savings, a smaller portion into important initiatives for us, including around CSR and user safety, where we're putting incremental resources. And on top of that, as I said in my remarks, we're also spending a larger and larger portion of our revenue on App Store fees given that more of our payers are coming in through the App Stores. That probably creates about 1 point or so of margin headwind for us, but we're offsetting that by being -- by operating leverage on the sales and marketing side. So I'd say those probably wash out and are relatively neutral. 
And then the last kind of put and take that I would point you to is what I mentioned about Google's previously announced requirement to use their in-app payment system, which they're supposed to put into effect at the end of March. Frankly, it's really difficult for me to fathom Google making that policy change, given all the legal and regulatory pressures that they're facing. And recall that they delayed this policy once before. They've made exceptions for it in certain markets. So we'll see how that plays out, but that's kind of my thinking around that at this point in time. So hopefully, that's helpful on the margin side. I'm sorry, what was the second question around Japan and other markets?"

We're not back to normal, as Shar said. We're not seeing the strength in new users yet. And so that is affecting the business everywhere.

So it's a meaningful number when you aggregate the effect on our 2021 in Japan versus what we were thinking. And that's going to carry through into 2022 because, as Shar said, that market has nowhere near gone back to normal. 
Aside from Japan, there's a couple of other markets in Asia. Korea is also very strictly enforcing restrictions around the pandemic. And so that's another market which has clearly not gone back to normal. And there's other ones in Asia as well that are smaller for us. Even India hasn't fully bounced back. As an example, it's better than it was at the depths, but it's improved meaningful, but it's still down significantly from pre-pandemic. So there's a number of markets, especially across Asia, where there are some lingering effect, but Japan is really the most meaningful one for us."

And the goal now is to have new and personalized experiences that are fun, interactive, useful in helping spark connections. And we've already got 70% of our users adopting the experience, and we're seeing high levels of engagement and likes, messages and conversations. So looking ahead, our plan is to continuously launch and feature a variety of novel and engaging experiences here. 
We talked about the music mode launch in the letter. Soon to come, for example, is going to be an experience that's a fun rip on the classic blind date experience. Explore also allows us to have geographically tailored programming. So in Brazil, we're about to launch Carnival mode on Valentine's Day. It's going to be an Explore experience that allows members to opt in to match with others that are celebrating carnival in their major cities like Rio, Sao Paulo, Salvador, et cetera. And people can share their favorite parties, where they're traveling to. Carnival is the most important cultural moment in Brazil, and it's a moment that connects people. And it's a great example of how Explore enables a fluid virtual to -- in real life experience. 
So additionally, as you can imagine, this new surface area with these Explore tiles also provides us opportunities for integrations with third parties to drive sort of new experiences in the app and offline. And it gives people a reason to keep coming back and check out these new experiences. 
And then as this -- the adoption and engagement on the service area increases, it does provide new opportunities to us to merchandise revenue features, both existing and new revenue features. So that's why we're so excited about this whole new surface area that we've created."

First of all, I would just point out that as a general matter, it's not unusual for us to see kind of limited sequential growth in payers Q4 over Q3. So overall, the trend is not atypical for us. And th",507,"Sure. Happy to do that, and good to hear your voice. First of all, I would just point out that as a general matter, it's not unusual for us to see kind of limited sequential growth in payers Q4 over Q3. So overall, the trend is not atypical for us. And then I would point out to a number of factors to think about as you look at the Q4 payers' numbers and results. 
The first, what you rightly point out, is Omicron, right? We saw a spike kind of in that early part of December, especially in some of the Western markets, and it did affect our payer numbers starting in December. So there was a change in trend after Omicron burst onto the scene. And so that's a big part of what happened in the end of Q4. We've called out many times kind of the lingering COVID impacts we see in some markets that haven't returned back to normal, Asia, particularly Japan. That's another factor around payers and the performance in Q4. 
And then I also mentioned that we had reduced marketing spend because we just couldn't hit our ROI hurdles, especially with some of our marketing heavy brands. Match, as an example, and others of the established brands were impacted in Q4 as we pulled back on marketing spend to protect our return expectation. So those things, I think, together are the key trends that we saw. 
Looking at Q1, we're not expecting a massive shift in some of those things. We still have Omicron lingering. We feel like we're getting closer to the end. But it continues to be an issue in a number of markets. And as we said in the earlier remarks, it hasn't even really worked its way through the Asia markets, Korea, Japan. They've got the hatches battened down to prepare for it, and that's going to affect deal's behavior in those markets. So while we're moving through it in the West, you still got to go through it in some of the Asian markets. And so that's going to be an effect here in early 2022. And then hopefully, we'll get through this and we'll have an inflection point in the pandemic and in the impact on people's social lives and dating. 
The only other thing which I just want to add is that -- and we say this all the time, we don't manage our results for specific payer growth or RPP growth or whatever. We're managing it for revenue growth. And so we are making trade-offs all the time in terms of price optimizations and so forth. And so that does move the payers' numbers around? I called out one in my remarks around discounting at Tinder that we're adjusting policies there. So you're going to continue to see us make those decisions. That could have effects on payer numbers, but ultimately, we think are the right thing to do for the business and certainly to grow revenue the way we want to grow revenue."

And that sort of reflects in how rich the profile is, the way you consume them, the way you communicate on the platform. And the team has kept innovating and pulling ahead of competition every year. The way they implemented audio, which basic audio, for instance, but they did it in the form of voice prompts, and how that became such a resonant in socially viral feature is an example of how they approach product development. And this particular product, I think, has a pretty big resonance among a large segment of audience. It is differentiated in the market. And that's what gives us confidence about the international rollout. 
On monetization specifically, Hinge has made real progress on RPP, as you know, this past year. And we certainly don't think it's near its feeling. But our expectation this year in 2022 is for Hinge to do over $300 million in revenue. And it's going to be driven by both strong payer growth as well as continued growth in RPP."

So look, I would say that our outlook for right now is assuming that we gradually come out of the Omicron impacts by geography, first, in the West, Europe and the U.S. and then ultimately, in Asia. And I think that's going to take some time into the second quarter. A little hard to tell if maybe Asia handles things differently once they've seen what people have done over here. But right now, that's our assumption. 
And as we come out of the Omicron impact, what we're assuming is that activity behavior goes back to pre-Omicron levels, but not back to pre-pandemic levels. So kind of the fog of Omicron lifts, and we go back to where we thought we were in October of last year as opposed to where we were in 2019, as an example. Now that could be a wrong assumption because I don't know how people are going to behave depending on how confident they feel, how much of an end we reached to all of this, let's say, sometime in the spring. And so that is a swing factor in our outlook, but we're not assuming a huge summer of love right now in our outlook that would clearly provide upside or at least the ability to reach the higher ends of the outlook, if that happened. I think it's entirely possible. I know a lot of people feel like as soon as we get to those warm summer months, there's going to be a real big wave, but we're not forecasting that at the moment until we see some evidence that really this is over, and that is how people are going to behave, but we'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're more sober on our forecast because we've been head-faked a few times, and it's been going on for a long time, and no one's had a great ability to predict kind of what the pandemic brings and what the effects are. 
So that's how we're forecasting, but we remain very optimistic that people are going to want to go out and date and socialize in big numbers once they feel the risk is down and they're ready to do that. And we clearly have not gotten to that yet. We're hoping it happens kind of in the summer months, spring and summer months, but remains to be seen. 
I would also just say on our forecast that we don't have a significant amount included for kind of key new initiatives that Tinder -- the Tinder virtual goods as an example. We don't have a lot included for Hinge International because those are really more '23 items in our minds than 2022. But to the extent we're able to accelerate some of those or we see bigger impact early on than we are currently anticipating, that could also be a swing factor on our second half on our overall 2022. So those are some of the puts and takes there. 
We're trying to quantify how much Japan has cost us. As I said, we've got the #1, #2 apps. Our Pairs app has felt a significant amount of impact. Tinder has felt some. I don't have a great estimate, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's $35 million, $40 million of impact on our 2021 that we would have seen that revenue had Japan been operating more normally. So it is a big market for us. It's a big contributor, and the impact is pretty meaningful. And I don't think we're going to get that recovery really in the first half of this year. We'll see if we get it in the second half."

But Obviously, we're going to look at how to deploy any changes they make. We have the ability to return some of that to customers in the form of discounting to them. We also will have higher return on our marketing spend because we'll be paying less to the Stores. And so we'll be able to spend more into marketing, which should enhance our growth. So there's a number of things that we can do with any savings that we achieve from the App Stores over time. And like we said, we remain optimistic at some of that's coming, but this is a slow process on the regulatory front. And so right now, we have not made any further assumptions around that in our numbers for 2022."

I think you had questions about sort of what are the key legislations around the world. So there has been a lot of momentum on this issue. Mandatory iApp is now deemed illegal in South Korea and more recently, in Netherlands under both Dutch and more importantly, EU law. It has been surprising to see Apple's response of noncompliance in these countries despite the EUR 5 million per week fine they are now subject to in Netherlands. 
More consequentially, here in the U.S., just end of last week, 35 state attorney generals and the DOJ filed an Amicus Brief supporting Epic's position and opined that, that decision was wrongly decided. Also this week, the Open App Markets Act that addresses app store policies, including IAP, which seems to have bipartisan support in the Senate, is expected to move out of committee, hopefully, this week. So there's little that both sides agree to these days. The fact that this has such bipartisan support shows how unfair and inequitable some of these policies are deemed to be. 
So as Gary said, the timing of all of this regulation and legislative changes are hard to predict. It is the single -- the App Store fees are the single biggest expense line for us at the moment. They exceeded 550 million last year. They're going to increase meaningfully this year. And we remain optimistic that change is coming. And obviously, there's a lot of good we can do with that in addition to margin expansion, reinvestment, et cetera."

So we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of months. But that's how I sort of handicap just given where the trends are blowing, which are very, very clear, as Shar said.

First of all, we continue to make great, great progress working with Hyperconnect. We have a lot of confidence in the team and their innovation. Our teams are collaborating really well globally. We're learning from them. They're learning from us. So it's really going well from that standpoint. And we think they are very quick on product. They're innovative. They move fast. So that's all great from our perspective. 
In terms of investment, we continue to look at that. We are investing and adding people to help them build some of the things that we want to plug in across our apps. And all of that is kind of baked into our numbers for the year. And I said Hyperconnect is going to be better than breakeven even with all of that investment included. So we'll continue to hopefully see margins improve from there as we get the operating leverage on the investment and on their capabilities. 
In terms of kind of what's happened so far, just to give you some concrete examples, we rolled audio and video rooms and one-to-one video chat using their technology on to 2 of our apps, Match and Meetic, thus far. If you use the European business, Meetic, as the example, what we call the live cafe with audio and video has been really well received by their user base. Usage of the features continues to grow. People are returning to engage with the product. The feedback is very positive. And so we're very excited about how that's all going. And in fact, we're planning a major live event at Meetic on the technology for Valentine's Day. So that's another good example of an event that's coming up that uses the technology and to be current. So that's an example of kind of engagement and how that's going, and Meetic and Hyperconnect are continuing to build out capabilities and features and working hand in glove. And so it's great not only for the user base, but also going well from a collaborative standpoint. 
At Match, if you want to use that as an example, we did replace a third-party vendor's technology on the video side with Hyperconnect. And so not only did that lead to some cost savings for us, but also it means we have much more responsiveness to changes we want to make and things we want to try. We think the product overall is much better using Hyperconnect. And so having that in-house has led to not only cost savings, which you asked about, but also benefits in terms of the overall quality that we're excited about. 
So when you look at both what's happened at Match and Meetic with Hyperconnect technology, thus far, we're extremely encouraged. And what that's doing is it's leading us to have more confidence to roll that out on more of our apps. And so we're planning to bring that out into our Pairs app and a part of it into our Plenty of Fish app over the coming time. And so we'll continue to roll it out across the portfolio. 
And as you alluded to, we are thinking about what we might do at Tinder. And so more to come on that topic. But obviously, there's great potential there if we can find some things to leverage from Hyperconnect into the Tinder platform, and we are looking at that. We think Explore provides a great place to try some of those features and technologies. So much, much more to come, but I think from a collaborative standpoint, from a using-their-technology standpoint across our apps, things are tracking according to plan, if not maybe ahead of it, and it's really going as well as we could have expected."

Right now, we're focused on the metaverse as it relates to the experience on the smartphone and not any other hardware-enabled experiences. So that's to clarify. 
Now the technology that is relevant to our world is the one that allows us to create experiences online where people can meet each other, discover each other more serendipitously and real time through shared experiences in a way that is more akin to how they would do in real life versus the profile-sorting experience that exists today. And so that sort of what Metaverse allows us to do and why we think that's relevant in our world. 
Imagine sort of a virtual club in the app where your digital self can walk around, check out live, different rooms. They meet others listening to the same music. You can strike up a conversation with someone. You can tap and check out their full profile. You can like them, message them later. And so that's sort of the -- how we envision the Metaverse experience leading to the dating context and the dating experience in our app. 
Now in terms of the types of underlying technology that's needed to enable these experiences, this is what the Hyperconnect team has been innovating on, right? Beyond just the real-time live, low-latency video, audio technology that they have, there are additional technology elements, everything from what's -- the pieces of the virtual human technology, the virtual fraud technology, also like audio and video connection based on location -- connections that are based on locations on a map, for instance, and so on.

We're helping them in a few fronts, and that seems to be starting to pay off, both on the marketing side as well as on the product side. And we've had teams focused on this now for a little while. And so we're seeing improvement. And they've innovated with some new product features. That seem to be working. So that's giving us some optimism going into 2022, more work to do.

You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done",1042,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done with COVID in 2021, the recent Omicron surge is a reminder that we aren't quite at the end yet, although I sure hope we're close. 
So our business grew 25% in revenue despite the waves of Delta and more recently, Omicron. And this latest Omicron surge has impacted peak season behaviors and dating sentiment in parts of the world. And because these surges have had glaring effects on our business, I thought I would start by sort of level-setting where our business is in the context of the pandemic. 
So if you recall, back in 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, our business took a hit during the global lockdowns, and it then stabilized by late spring. And at that time, both user activity and propensity to pay slowly recovered. And as we've dealt with different waves of COVID since, usually, the mobility restrictions are generally impacted dating activity. And now fast forward 2 years, while much of the Western markets, including the U.S., are seeing less and less impact to activity and propensity to pay with these ongoing surges, several markets, particularly in Asia, are still disproportionately impacted. 
Japan, for instance, has now dealt with 3 periods of state of emergency last year, all of which had, had a meaningful impact to mobility and general dating sentiment. And there seems to be a glimmer of hope after that last one was lifted. But again, Omicron has them back in a quasi state of emergency at least until February 20. And all of this has led to a level of anxiety and fatigue, particularly in these winter months, and we're seeing the effects of this in Japan and parts of Asia. 
Now beyond these geographic differences, as we've said before a few times, while active online daters and propensity to metrics have largely recovered in Western markets, there is still a hesitancy among new users who have never tried dating apps before to break into the category. Now these are usually largely driven by word of mouth, and that, of course, depends on normal levels of socializing, which hasn't yet happened. And if you've resisted online dating until now, the pandemic hardly seems the right time to start. So this past year, we have seen periodic uptakes in new entrants when COVID is not dominating the new cycle. But by and large, that has not fully recovered in a sustained way. 
So unlike categories like, say, online groceries, for instance, where pandemic pulled forward new users, for us, nonusers breaking into the category, even at a normal cadence, is still to come. And we feel optimistic that if Omicron truly is what causes the shift from a pandemic to endemic, and if things do indeed return to more normal in spring and summer, we are well positioned to be able to capitalize on it. We've made a significant progress in building out our portfolio of products that appeal to different demographics and intent. We've innovated on many pain points, everything from trust and safety to more authentic discovery and getting to know each other experiences. We've been disciplined and measured in our marketing efforts given the macro climate, but we're ready with several creative and optimistic campaigns to reenergize dating sentiment as soon as we are in a new post-pandemic normal. Romance and love maybe just the thing that shakes us out of this collective malaise. 
Now Tinder, beyond a 22% revenue growth, in 2021, Tinder released its biggest update since the invention of the Swipe feature, and this was the launch of Tinder Explore. Explore provides Tinder with additional flexibility to expand use cases to more dimensions of discovery and social live experiences. Explore enhances responsiveness, offers surface and opportunity for regionally tailored experiences; has exciting media, video dating hybrids such as Swipe Night, wedding dates, concert festival mode; and it's clearly had a productive start with almost 70% of users adopting this experience. The 2022 road map has many more enhancements planned, along with new monetization opportunities later in the year. 
Hinge. Hinge has had an impressive year where they've more than doubled revenue. They're also seeing a strong start to 2022 in markets they've been around at, like the U.K. and Australia. And the voice prompts feature they launched late last year has really resonated with users, not to mention the social virality this have seen. Turns out people's life goals, dating styles and their best dad jokes are both entertaining and insightful. Our 2022 plan for Hinge, to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets, remains intact. 
We're also making progress at Hyperconnect and stabilizing the core business, and we plan to return them to growth later this year. They have recently launched a Azar lounge, their live streaming feature, and Hakuna [ city ], their interactive and immersive new discovery experience. And they continue to experiment with metaverse elements, both in dating and social discovery context. 
We've also successfully integrated Hyperconnect's live video and audio tech on a couple of our platforms. And the teams are making progress, enabling our other brands to leverage their technology more broadly to build new immersive discovery and live experiences. While much remains to be done at Hyperconnect, we're actually very confident it is on the right track, and it is pushing us forward in a number of areas that are critical to our long-term growth. 
As I reflect on last year, what jumps out to me has been ability to find opportunities in the face of uncertainty. And despite this latest Omicron surge and all the uncertainty it may create over the next couple of months, I am hopeful about 2022, how we're going to use technology and innovate product experiences; tell our story with ever more creative marketing; and most importantly, profoundly change many more lives around the world. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some color on the quarter and the full year."

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year.

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened meaningfully against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $12 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, total revenue would have been $818 million, up 26% year-over-year. We did not anticipate about $9 million of FX headwind when we provided our outlook in early November. 
Our direct revenue grew 24% year-over-year. It grew 21% in the Americas, an acceleration from last quarter; 16% in Europe; and 46% in APAC and Other. We did feel some COVID impacts on our business, particularly from the emergence of the Omicron variant, which severely reduced mobility in a number of markets starting in December. COVID continues to be a meaningful overhang on our Japanese business and in certain other markets. 
Total payers were 16.2 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 10% year-over-year in both the Americas and Europe, and 36% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. 
RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.16 in Q4. RPP was up a solid 10% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 7% in APAC and Other. Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $444 million, up 23% year-over-year, an acceleration over Q3's rate. Tinder had payers' growth of 18% year-over-year, adding 1.6 million payers to 10.6 million, an RPP growth of 4% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Tinder Platinum subscribers comprised approximately 13% of total Tinder subscribers, exceeding 1 million in aggregate. Tinder active user growth continues to be strong, with the brand achieving a record number of active users on its platform globally in 2021. Engagement on the platform also continues to be robust with several KPIs such as daily swipes and messages at or near all-time highs in Q4. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 26% year-over-year in Q4, driven by 16% RPP growth and 9% payers' growth. Hinge was the standout among this group, growing direct revenue approximately 90% year-over-year, driven by RPP growth of 60% to nearly $24 and reaching about 850,000 payers. BLK [ see spun upward ] in aggregate grew direct revenue over 70% year-over-year in Q4. 
Hyperconnect contributed about $50 million of total revenue in the quarter. The business saw improved performance in December compared to preceding months. It was also significantly impacted in the quarter by FX, especially against the Turkish lira as Turkey is a large market for Hyperconnect. 
Indirect revenue reached $18 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. This was off a very strong Q4 2020. Q4 operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $232 million for margins of 29%. And adjusted operating income, which we formally called adjusted EBITDA, grew 18% year-over-year to $290 million for margins of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins would have been 2.5 points higher, excluding Hyperconnect. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, with slightly less than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 21% year-over-year, primarily due to higher IAP fees and represented 28% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $12 million as we pulled back marketing spend across our portfolio to maintain our ROI discipline in a crowded holiday marketing environment. That did have some impact on payers, especially in our marketing-heavy brands like Match. 
Sales and marketing spend was down 5 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%. G&A expense excluding Hyperconnect, rose 38% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in legal fees. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 2 points or $28 million year-over-year. G&A was less than we had anticipated as the former Tinder employee litigation came to a conclusion on December 1. 
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 31% year-over-year and were 8% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, primarily Tinder. Our gross leverage declined to 3.7x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.9x at the end of Q4, achieving the target of below 3x that we set at the time of our separation. We ended the quarter with $827 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We have agreed to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations. We expect to pay this amount from cash on hand in Q1 2022. 
For full year 2022, we expect the company to deliver 15% to 20% year-over-year growth, driven by another strong year for both Tinder, where we expect high-teens year-over-year growth and Hinge. Our outlook includes approximately $85 million of negative year-over-year FX impacts on total revenue. That's approximately $60 million worse than what we expected at the time of our last earnings call in early November, which is about 2 points of growth. 
In addition to the FX impact, our revenue growth outlook is more conservative than what we shared in early November due to continued COVID impact, especially in Asia and particularly the rise of the Omicron variant, which is impacting us in the early goings of 2022. Keep in mind that we have a global business. And while we may be getting ready to move past Omicron in the U.S. and Europe, Asia still has to get through that period. So we expect our performance will continue to be somewhat impacted likely until sometime in Q2. 
In aggregate, our '22 revenue outlook has been reduced by about 3 points of growth since November due to the FX and COVID impacts. Our revenue outlook for 2022 also assumes momentum builds in the second half of the year. There remains much uncertainty about what happens next with the pandemic, but we have increased confidence that while the first part of 2022 may be tougher than we initially anticipated, the second half could be stronger. We're hopeful that once we get past the effects of Omicron, we could even have that summer of love that we had expected back in 2021 after the vaccines were introduced. 
We expect overall company margins to be roughly flat, inclusive of Hyperconnect, which we expect to be better than breakeven in 2022. For the full year, we expect 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement, excluding Hyperconnect, as we incur lower year-over-year legal expenses and lower fees on Google subscriptions, which we plan to partially reinvest in safety and CSR initiatives as well as higher employee costs given the ongoing war for talent. 
Note that despite Google's recent fee cut, which covered only subscription revenue, we actually expect to pay a greater percentage of our revenue to the app stores in 2022 than in 2021 as more of our users come in via app. For instance, on our fast-growing Hinge app, most payers use iOS, and we pay a full 30% on that revenue. 
Our margin outlook reflects current app store policies. Our outlook includes over $650 million of App Store fees in 2022, primarily to Apple. Our outlook does not include implementation of Google's previously announced requirement of mandatory use of its payment system starting in April 2022. Were that to happen, we incur approximately $50 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. Even though we're unable to forecast further change in App Store policies at this time, we remain optimistic that more changes to the App Store ecosystem are likely, and we will continue to update you. 
For full year 2022, we expect SBC expense of $175 million to $185 million, reflecting additional hiring and the continued competitive market for talent. CapEx of approximately $70 million, about $10 million lower than in 2021 and adjusted operating income to free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, excluding the $441 million legal settlement. We do not expect to be a material U.S. federal cash taxpayer in 2022. 
We have an initiative underway in countries where Tinder still offers age-based discounts to eliminate these discounts. These changes, which have begun in earnest in Q1, will impact Tinder payers beginning in Q1, but we expect these changes to be revenue neutral. For Q1, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by year-over-year payers growth in the low to mid-teens and year-over-year RPP growth in the mid-single digits, as is typical for us. However, the effects from Omicron could shift these metrics somewhat. We anticipate about $25 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q1, meaning that growth would be more than 4 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. 
We expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to be in the high teens in Q1 and that Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver direct revenue growth over 70% year-over-year in Q1. We anticipate that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q1 at similar levels to Q4 '21. 
We expect adjusted operating income of $260 million to $265 million in Q1, representing margins in the low-30s percent range, typical for a first quarter for us despite about 2.5 points of pressure from adding Hyperconnect. 
Our company has all the ingredients to continue to deliver on our mission of helping people make meaningful connections through our technology. Tinder has an exciting product road map and a growing global user base to continue to convert. Hinge's product continues to gain traction and the business has meaningful opportunities ahead, including in many international markets. There is so much we can do with Hyperconnect, not only deploy their video and audio tech capabilities across our apps, but have them help us build exciting new Metaverse dating apps and immersive user experiences, which we can potentially make use of across our portfolio. Our financial performance is strong with room to grow already best-in-class margins and potential App Store reform benefits. We strongly believe that the next phase of our business is going to be very exciting. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

First of all, as I said, our outlook for margins for this year, inclusive of Hyperconnect, is that they'd be relatively flat, which we actually think is a strong performance, especially in this environment. And Hyperconnect contributes over 1 point of margin headwind for the year. 
If you look through the puts and takes, we probably have a bit over 2 points, I would say, of margin improvement from legal expense savings and Google's reduction from 30% to 15% on subscriptions. But we're currently forecasting that we could reinvest more than half of that savings into hiring new people and in retaining our existing talent, especially in the very competitive market that we're operating in for talent right now. 
We also plan to reinvest some of the -- for some of the savings, a smaller portion into important initiatives for us, including around CSR and user safety, where we're putting incremental resources. And on top of that, as I said in my remarks, we're also spending a larger and larger portion of our revenue on App Store fees given that more of our payers are coming in through the App Stores. That probably creates about 1 point or so of margin headwind for us, but we're offsetting that by being -- by operating leverage on the sales and marketing side. So I'd say those probably wash out and are relatively neutral. 
And then the last kind of put and take that I would point you to is what I mentioned about Google's previously announced requirement to use their in-app payment system, which they're supposed to put into effect at the end of March. Frankly, it's really difficult for me to fathom Google making that policy change, given all the legal and regulatory pressures that they're facing. And recall that they delayed this policy once before. They've made exceptions for it in certain markets. So we'll see how that plays out, but that's kind of my thinking around that at this point in time. So hopefully, that's helpful on the margin side. I'm sorry, what was the second question around Japan and other markets?"

We're not back to normal, as Shar said. We're not seeing the strength in new users yet. And so that is affecting the business everywhere.

So it's a meaningful number when you aggregate the effect on our 2021 in Japan versus what we were thinking. And that's going to carry through into 2022 because, as Shar said, that market has nowhere near gone back to normal. 
Aside from Japan, there's a couple of other markets in Asia. Korea is also very strictly enforcing restrictions around the pandemic. And so that's another market which has clearly not gone back to normal. And there's other ones in Asia as well that are smaller for us. Even India hasn't fully bounced back. As an example, it's better than it was at the depths, but it's improved meaningful, but it's still down significantly from pre-pandemic. So there's a number of markets, especially across Asia, where there are some lingering effect, but Japan is really the most meaningful one for us."

And the goal now is to have new and personalized experiences that are fun, interactive, useful in helping spark connections. And we've already got 70% of our users adopting the experience, and we're seeing high levels of engagement and likes, messages and conversations. So looking ahead, our plan is to continuously launch and feature a variety of novel and engaging experiences here. 
We talked about the music mode launch in the letter. Soon to come, for example, is going to be an experience that's a fun rip on the classic blind date experience. Explore also allows us to have geographically tailored programming. So in Brazil, we're about to launch Carnival mode on Valentine's Day. It's going to be an Explore experience that allows members to opt in to match with others that are celebrating carnival in their major cities like Rio, Sao Paulo, Salvador, et cetera. And people can share their favorite parties, where they're traveling to. Carnival is the most important cultural moment in Brazil, and it's a moment that connects people. And it's a great example of how Explore enables a fluid virtual to -- in real life experience. 
So additionally, as you can imagine, this new surface area with these Explore tiles also provides us opportunities for integrations with third parties to drive sort of new experiences in the app and offline. And it gives people a reason to keep coming back and check out these new experiences. 
And then as this -- the adoption and engagement on the service area increases, it does provide new opportunities to us to merchandise revenue features, both existing and new revenue features. So that's why we're so excited about this whole new surface area that we've created."

And th",507,"Sure. Happy to do that, and good to hear your voice. First of all, I would just point out that as a general matter, it's not unusual for us to see kind of limited sequential growth in payers Q4 over Q3. So overall, the trend is not atypical for us. And then I would point out to a number of factors to think about as you look at the Q4 payers' numbers and results. 
The first, what you rightly point out, is Omicron, right? We saw a spike kind of in that early part of December, especially in some of the Western markets, and it did affect our payer numbers starting in December. So there was a change in trend after Omicron burst onto the scene. And so that's a big part of what happened in the end of Q4. We've called out many times kind of the lingering COVID impacts we see in some markets that haven't returned back to normal, Asia, particularly Japan. That's another factor around payers and the performance in Q4. 
And then I also mentioned that we had reduced marketing spend because we just couldn't hit our ROI hurdles, especially with some of our marketing heavy brands. Match, as an example, and others of the established brands were impacted in Q4 as we pulled back on marketing spend to protect our return expectation. So those things, I think, together are the key trends that we saw. 
Looking at Q1, we're not expecting a massive shift in some of those things. We still have Omicron lingering. We feel like we're getting closer to the end. But it continues to be an issue in a number of markets. And as we said in the earlier remarks, it hasn't even really worked its way through the Asia markets, Korea, Japan. They've got the hatches battened down to prepare for it, and that's going to affect deal's behavior in those markets. So while we're moving through it in the West, you still got to go through it in some of the Asian markets. And so that's going to be an effect here in early 2022. And then hopefully, we'll get through this and we'll have an inflection point in the pandemic and in the impact on people's social lives and dating. 
The only other thing which I just want to add is that -- and we say this all the time, we don't manage our results for specific payer growth or RPP growth or whatever. We're managing it for revenue growth. And so we are making trade-offs all the time in terms of price optimizations and so forth. And so that does move the payers' numbers around? I called out one in my remarks around discounting at Tinder that we're adjusting policies there. So you're going to continue to see us make those decisions. That could have effects on payer numbers, but ultimately, we think are the right thing to do for the business and certainly to grow revenue the way we want to grow revenue."

And that sort of reflects in how rich the profile is, the way you consume them, the way you communicate on the platform. And the team has kept innovating and pulling ahead of competition every year. The way they implemented audio, which basic audio, for instance, but they did it in the form of voice prompts, and how that became such a resonant in socially viral feature is an example of how they approach product development. And this particular product, I think, has a pretty big resonance among a large segment of audience. It is differentiated in the market. And that's what gives us confidence about the international rollout. 
On monetization specifically, Hinge has made real progress on RPP, as you know, this past year. And we certainly don't think it's near its feeling. But our expectation this year in 2022 is for Hinge to do over $300 million in revenue. And it's going to be driven by both strong payer growth as well as continued growth in RPP."

So look, I would say that our outlook for right now is assuming that we gradually come out of the Omicron impacts by geography, first, in the West, Europe and the U.S. and then ultimately, in Asia. And I think that's going to take some time into the second quarter. A little hard to tell if maybe Asia handles things differently once they've seen what people have done over here. But right now, that's our assumption. 
And as we come out of the Omicron impact, what we're assuming is that activity behavior goes back to pre-Omicron levels, but not back to pre-pandemic levels. So kind of the fog of Omicron lifts, and we go back to where we thought we were in October of last year as opposed to where we were in 2019, as an example. Now that could be a wrong assumption because I don't know how people are going to behave depending on how confident they feel, how much of an end we reached to all of this, let's say, sometime in the spring. And so that is a swing factor in our outlook, but we're not assuming a huge summer of love right now in our outlook that would clearly provide upside or at least the ability to reach the higher ends of the outlook, if that happened. I think it's entirely possible. I know a lot of people feel like as soon as we get to those warm summer months, there's going to be a real big wave, but we're not forecasting that at the moment until we see some evidence that really this is over, and that is how people are going to behave, but we'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're more sober on our forecast because we've been head-faked a few times, and it's been going on for a long time, and no one's had a great ability to predict kind of what the pandemic brings and what the effects are. 
So that's how we're forecasting, but we remain very optimistic that people are going to want to go out and date and socialize in big numbers once they feel the risk is down and they're ready to do that. And we clearly have not gotten to that yet. We're hoping it happens kind of in the summer months, spring and summer months, but remains to be seen. 
I would also just say on our forecast that we don't have a significant amount included for kind of key new initiatives that Tinder -- the Tinder virtual goods as an example. We don't have a lot included for Hinge International because those are really more '23 items in our minds than 2022. But to the extent we're able to accelerate some of those or we see bigger impact early on than we are currently anticipating, that could also be a swing factor on our second half on our overall 2022. So those are some of the puts and takes there. 
We're trying to quantify how much Japan has cost us. As I said, we've got the #1, #2 apps. Our Pairs app has felt a significant amount of impact. Tinder has felt some. I don't have a great estimate, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's $35 million, $40 million of impact on our 2021 that we would have seen that revenue had Japan been operating more normally. So it is a big market for us. It's a big contributor, and the impact is pretty meaningful. And I don't think we're going to get that recovery really in the first half of this year. We'll see if we get it in the second half."

We also will have higher return on our marketing spend because we'll be paying less to the Stores. And so we'll be able to spend more into marketing, which should enhance our growth. So there's a number of things that we can do with any savings that we achieve from the App Stores over time. And like we said, we remain optimistic at some of that's coming, but this is a slow process on the regulatory front. And so right now, we have not made any further assumptions around that in our numbers for 2022."

I think you had questions about sort of what are the key legislations around the world. So there has been a lot of momentum on this issue. Mandatory iApp is now deemed illegal in South Korea and more recently, in Netherlands under both Dutch and more importantly, EU law. It has been surprising to see Apple's response of noncompliance in these countries despite the EUR 5 million per week fine they are now subject to in Netherlands. 
More consequentially, here in the U.S., just end of last week, 35 state attorney generals and the DOJ filed an Amicus Brief supporting Epic's position and opined that, that decision was wrongly decided. Also this week, the Open App Markets Act that addresses app store policies, including IAP, which seems to have bipartisan support in the Senate, is expected to move out of committee, hopefully, this week. So there's little that both sides agree to these days. The fact that this has such bipartisan support shows how unfair and inequitable some of these policies are deemed to be. 
So as Gary said, the timing of all of this regulation and legislative changes are hard to predict. It is the single -- the App Store fees are the single biggest expense line for us at the moment. They exceeded 550 million last year. They're going to increase meaningfully this year. And we remain optimistic that change is coming. And obviously, there's a lot of good we can do with that in addition to margin expansion, reinvestment, et cetera."

So we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of months. But that's how I sort of handicap just given where the trends are blowing, which are very, very clear, as Shar said.

First of all, we continue to make great, great progress working with Hyperconnect. We have a lot of confidence in the team and their innovation. Our teams are collaborating really well globally. We're learning from them. They're learning from us. So it's really going well from that standpoint. And we think they are very quick on product. They're innovative. They move fast. So that's all great from our perspective. 
In terms of investment, we continue to look at that. We are investing and adding people to help them build some of the things that we want to plug in across our apps. And all of that is kind of baked into our numbers for the year. And I said Hyperconnect is going to be better than breakeven even with all of that investment included. So we'll continue to hopefully see margins improve from there as we get the operating leverage on the investment and on their capabilities. 
In terms of kind of what's happened so far, just to give you some concrete examples, we rolled audio and video rooms and one-to-one video chat using their technology on to 2 of our apps, Match and Meetic, thus far. If you use the European business, Meetic, as the example, what we call the live cafe with audio and video has been really well received by their user base. Usage of the features continues to grow. People are returning to engage with the product. The feedback is very positive. And so we're very excited about how that's all going. And in fact, we're planning a major live event at Meetic on the technology for Valentine's Day. So that's another good example of an event that's coming up that uses the technology and to be current. So that's an example of kind of engagement and how that's going, and Meetic and Hyperconnect are continuing to build out capabilities and features and working hand in glove. And so it's great not only for the user base, but also going well from a collaborative standpoint. 
At Match, if you want to use that as an example, we did replace a third-party vendor's technology on the video side with Hyperconnect. And so not only did that lead to some cost savings for us, but also it means we have much more responsiveness to changes we want to make and things we want to try. We think the product overall is much better using Hyperconnect. And so having that in-house has led to not only cost savings, which you asked about, but also benefits in terms of the overall quality that we're excited about. 
So when you look at both what's happened at Match and Meetic with Hyperconnect technology, thus far, we're extremely encouraged. And what that's doing is it's leading us to have more confidence to roll that out on more of our apps. And so we're planning to bring that out into our Pairs app and a part of it into our Plenty of Fish app over the coming time. And so we'll continue to roll it out across the portfolio. 
And as you alluded to, we are thinking about what we might do at Tinder. And so more to come on that topic. But obviously, there's great potential there if we can find some things to leverage from Hyperconnect into the Tinder platform, and we are looking at that. We think Explore provides a great place to try some of those features and technologies. So much, much more to come, but I think from a collaborative standpoint, from a using-their-technology standpoint across our apps, things are tracking according to plan, if not maybe ahead of it, and it's really going as well as we could have expected."

Now the technology that is relevant to our world is the one that allows us to create experiences online where people can meet each other, discover each other more serendipitously and real time through shared experiences in a way that is more akin to how they would do in real life versus the profile-sorting experience that exists today. And so that sort of what Metaverse allows us to do and why we think that's relevant in our world. 
Imagine sort of a virtual club in the app where your digital self can walk around, check out live, different rooms. They meet others listening to the same music. You can strike up a conversation with someone. You can tap and check out their full profile. You can like them, message them later. And so that's sort of the -- how we envision the Metaverse experience leading to the dating context and the dating experience in our app. 
Now in terms of the types of underlying technology that's needed to enable these experiences, this is what the Hyperconnect team has been innovating on, right? Beyond just the real-time live, low-latency video, audio technology that they have, there are additional technology elements, everything from what's -- the pieces of the virtual human technology, the virtual fraud technology, also like audio and video connection based on location -- connections that are based on locations on a map, for instance, and so on.

And that, of course, doesn't include all the great stuff they're doing for us across the portfolio, which is meaningful as well. So we feel great about how Hyperconnect's scaling. And we know there's more work to do, and we're very focused on it at this point. I think that that's it, given that we're getting close to the bottom of the hour. So really appreciate everybody joining for this call. I hope everyone stays well and safe out there. And we look forward to talking to you in the warm spring months in May, where we'll be looking forward to a great summer. Thanks very much."

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining the call today. 
You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done with COVID in 2021, the recent Omicron surge is a reminder that we aren't quite at the end yet, although I sure hope we're close.  
So our business grew 25% (sic) [ 24% ] in revenue despite the waves of Delta and more recently, Omicron. And this latest Omicron surge has impacted peak season behaviors and dating sentiment in parts of the world. And because these surges have had varying effects on our business, I thought I would start by sort of level-setting where our business is in the context of the pandemic.  
So if you recall, back in 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, our business took a hit during the global lockdowns, and it then stabilized by late spring. And at that time, both user activity and propensity to pay slowly recovered. And as we've dealt with different waves of COVID since, usually, the mobility restrictions are generally impacted dating activity. And now fast forward 2 years, while much of the Western markets, including the U.S., are seeing less and less impact to activity and propensity to pay with these ongoing surges, several markets, particularly in Asia, are still disproportionately impacted.  
Japan, for instance, has now dealt with 3 periods of state of emergency last year, all of which have had a meaningful impact to mobility and general dating sentiment. And there seems to be a glimmer of hope after that last one was lifted. But again, Omicron has them back in a quasi state of emergency at least until February 20.  
And all of this has led to a level of anxiety and fatigue, particularly in these winter months, and we're seeing the effects of this in Japan and parts of Asia.  
Now beyond these geographic differences, as we've said before a few times, while active online daters and propensity to metrics have largely recovered in Western markets, there is still a hesitancy among new users who have never tried dating apps before to break into the category. Now these are usually largely driven by word of mouth, and that, of course, depends on normal levels of socializing, which hasn't yet happened. And if you've resisted online dating until now, the pandemic hardly seems the right time to start. So this past year, we have seen periodic uptakes in new entrants when COVID is not dominating the news cycle. But by and large, that has not fully recovered in a sustained way.  
So unlike categories like, say, online groceries, for instance, where pandemic pulled forward new users, for us, nonusers breaking into the category, even at a normal cadence, is still to come. And we feel optimistic that if Omicron truly is what causes the shift from a pandemic to endemic, and if things do indeed return to more normal in spring and summer, we are well positioned to be able to capitalize on it. 
We've made a significant progress in building out our portfolio of products that appeal to different demographics and intent. We've innovated on many pain points, everything from trust and safety to more authentic discovery and getting to know each other experiences. We've been disciplined and measured in our marketing efforts given the macro climate, but we're ready with several creative and optimistic campaigns to reenergize dating sentiment as soon as we are in a new post-pandemic normal.  
Romance and love maybe just the thing that shakes us out of this collective malaise.  
Now Tinder, beyond a 22% (sic) [ 23% ] revenue growth, in 2021, Tinder released its biggest update since the invention of the Swipe feature, and this was the launch of Tinder Explore. Explore provides Tinder with additional flexibility to expand use cases to more dimensions of discovery and social live experiences. Explore enhances responsiveness, offers surface and opportunity for regionally tailored experiences; has exciting media, video dating hybrids such as Swipe Night, wedding dates, concert Festival Mode; and it's clearly had a productive start with almost 70% of users adopting this experience.  
The 2022 road map has many more enhancements planned, along with new monetization opportunities later in the year.  
Hinge. Hinge has had an impressive year where they more than doubled revenue. They're also seeing a strong start to 2022 in markets they've been around at, like the U.K. and Australia. And the Voice Prompts feature they launched late last year has really resonated with users, not to mention the social virality this have seen. Turns out people's life goals, dating styles and their best dad jokes are both entertaining and insightful. Our 2022 plan for Hinge, to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets, remains intact.  
We're also making progress at Hyperconnect and stabilizing the core business, and we plan to return them to growth later this year. They have recently launched a Azar lounge, their live streaming feature, and Hakuna city, their interactive and immersive new discovery experience. And they continue to experiment with metaverse elements, both in dating and social discovery context.  
We've also successfully integrated Hyperconnect's live video and audio tech on a couple of our platforms. And the teams are making progress, enabling our other brands to leverage their technology more broadly to build new immersive discovery and live experiences. 
While much remains to be done at Hyperconnect, we're actually very confident it is on the right track, and it is pushing us forward in a number of areas that are critical to our long-term growth.  
As I reflect on last year, what jumps out to me has been ability to find opportunities in the face of uncertainty. And despite this latest Omicron surge and all the uncertainty it may create over the next couple of months, I am hopeful about 2022, how we're going to use technology and innovate product experiences; tell our story with ever more creative marketing; and most importantly, profoundly change many more lives around the world.  
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some color on the quarter and the full year."

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year.

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened meaningfully against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $12 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, total revenue would have been $818 million, up 26% year-over-year. We did not anticipate about $9 million of FX headwind when we provided our outlook in early November.  
Our direct revenue grew 24% year-over-year. It grew 21% in the Americas, an acceleration from last quarter; 16% in Europe; and 46% in APAC and Other. We did feel some COVID impacts on our business, particularly from the emergence of the Omicron variant, which severely reduced mobility in a number of markets starting in December. COVID continues to be a meaningful overhang on our Japanese business and in certain other markets.  
Total payers were 16.2 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 10% year-over-year in both the Americas and Europe, and 36% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect.  
RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.16 in Q4. RPP was up a solid 10% in the Americas, 6% in Europe, and 7% in APAC and Other. 
Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $444 million, up 23% year-over-year, an acceleration over Q3's rate. Tinder had payers growth of 18% year-over-year, adding 1.6 million payers to 10.6 million, and RPP growth of 4% year-over-year in the quarter.  
Tinder Platinum subscribers comprised approximately 13% of total Tinder subscribers, exceeding 1 million in aggregate. 
Tinder active user growth continues to be strong, with the brand achieving a record number of active users on its platform globally in 2021. Engagement on the platform also continues to be robust with several KPIs such as daily swipes and messages at or near all-time highs in Q4.  
All other brands grew direct revenue 26% year-over-year in Q4, driven by 16% RPP growth and 9% payers growth. Hinge was the standout among this group, growing direct revenue approximately 90% year-over-year, driven by RPP growth of 60% to nearly $24 and reaching about 850,000 payers. BLK, Chispa and Upward in aggregate grew direct revenue over 70% year-over-year in Q4.  
Hyperconnect contributed about $50 million of total revenue in the quarter. The business saw improved performance in December compared to preceding months. It was also significantly impacted in the quarter by FX, especially against the Turkish lira as Turkey is a large market for Hyperconnect.  
Indirect revenue reached $18 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. This was off a very strong Q4 2020. 
Q4 operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $232 million for margins of 29%, and adjusted operating income, which we formally called adjusted EBITDA, grew 18% year-over-year to $290 million for margins of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins would have been 2.5 points higher, excluding Hyperconnect.  
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, with slightly less than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 21% year-over-year, primarily due to higher IAP fees and represented 28% of total revenue.  
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $12 million as we pulled back marketing spend across our portfolio to maintain our ROI discipline in a crowded holiday marketing environment. That did have some impact on payers, especially in our marketing-heavy brands like Match. Sales and marketing spend was down 5 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%. 
G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose 38% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in legal fees. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 2 points or $28 million year-over-year. G&A was less than we had anticipated as the former Tinder employee litigation came to a conclusion on December 1.  
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 31% year-over-year and were 8% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, primarily Tinder. 
Our gross leverage declined to 3.7x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.9x at the end of Q4, achieving the target of below 3x that we set at the time of our separation. 
We ended the quarter with $827 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We have agreed to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations. We expect to pay this amount from cash on hand in Q1 2022.  
For full year 2022, we expect the company to deliver 15% to 20% year-over-year growth, driven by another strong year for both Tinder, where we expect high-teens year-over-year growth, and Hinge. Our outlook includes approximately $85 million of negative year-over-year FX impacts on total revenue. That's approximately $60 million worse than what we expected at the time of our last earnings call in early November, which is about 2 points of growth.  
In addition to the FX impact, our revenue growth outlook is more conservative than what we shared in early November due to continued COVID impact, especially in Asia and particularly the rise of the Omicron variant, which is impacting us in the early goings of 2022. Keep in mind that we have a global business. And while we may be getting ready to move past Omicron in the U.S. and Europe, Asia still has to get through that period. So we expect our performance will continue to be somewhat impacted likely until sometime in Q2.  
In aggregate, our '22 revenue outlook has been reduced by about 3 points of growth since November due to the FX and COVID impacts. Our revenue outlook for 2022 also assumes momentum builds in the second half of the year. There remains much uncertainty about what happens next with the pandemic, but we have increased confidence that while the first part of 2022 may be tougher than we initially anticipated, the second half could be stronger. We're hopeful that once we get past the effects of Omicron, we could even have that summer of love that we had expected back in 2021 after the vaccines were introduced.  
We expect overall company margins to be roughly flat, inclusive of Hyperconnect, which we expect to be better than breakeven in 2022. For the full year, we expect 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement, excluding Hyperconnect, as we incur lower year-over-year legal expenses and lower fees on Google subscriptions, which we plan to partially reinvest in safety and CSR initiatives as well as higher employee costs given the ongoing war for talent.  
Note that despite Google's recent fee cut, which covered only subscription revenue, we actually expect to pay a greater percentage of our revenue to the App Stores in 2022 than in 2021 as more of our users come in via app. For instance, on our fast-growing Hinge app, most payers use iOS, and we pay a full 30% on that revenue.  
Our margin outlook reflects current App Store policies. Our outlook includes over $650 million of App Store fees in 2022, primarily to Apple. Our outlook does not include implementation of Google's previously announced requirement of mandatory use of its payment system starting in April 2022. Were that to happen, we'd incur approximately $50 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. 
Even though we're unable to forecast further change in App Store policies at this time, we remain optimistic that more changes to the App Store ecosystem are likely, and we will continue to update you.  
For full year 2022, we expect SBC expense of $175 million to $185 million, reflecting additional hiring and the continued competitive market for talent. CapEx of approximately $70 million, about $10 million lower than in 2021, and adjusted operating income to free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, excluding the $441 million legal settlement. We do not expect to be a material U.S. federal cash taxpayer in 2022.  
We have an initiative underway in countries where Tinder still offers age-based discounts to eliminate these discounts. These changes, which have begun in earnest in Q1, will impact Tinder payers beginning in Q1, but we expect these changes to be revenue neutral. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by year-over-year payers growth in the low to mid-teens and year-over-year RPP growth in the mid-single digits, as is typical for us. However, the effects from Omicron could shift these metrics somewhat. We anticipate about $25 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q1, meaning that growth would be more than 4 points higher on an FX-neutral basis.  
We expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to be in the high teens in Q1, and that Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver direct revenue growth over 70% year-over-year in Q1. We anticipate that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q1 at similar levels to Q4 '21.  
We expect adjusted operating income of $260 million to $265 million in Q1, representing margins in the low-30s percent range, typical for a first quarter for us despite about 2.5 points of pressure from adding Hyperconnect.  
Our company has all the ingredients to continue to deliver on our mission of helping people make meaningful connections through our technology. Tinder has an exciting product road map and a growing global user base to continue to convert. Hinge's product continues to gain traction and the business has meaningful opportunities ahead, including in many international markets. There is so much we can do with Hyperconnect, not only deploy their video and audio tech capabilities across our apps, but have them help us build exciting new metaverse dating apps and immersive user experiences, which we can potentially make use of across our portfolio. 
Our financial performance is strong with room to grow already best-in-class margins and potential App Store reform benefits. We strongly believe that the next phase of our business is going to be very exciting.  
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

First of all, as I said, our outlook for margins for this year, inclusive of Hyperconnect, is that they'd be relatively flat, which we actually think is a strong performance, especially in this environment. And Hyperconnect contributes over 1 point of margin headwind for the year. 
If you look through the puts and takes, we probably have a bit over 2 points, I would say, of margin improvement from legal expense savings and Google's reduction from 30% to 15% on subscriptions. But we're currently forecasting that we could reinvest more than half of that savings into hiring new people and in retaining our existing talent, especially in the very competitive market that we're operating in for talent right now. 
We also plan to reinvest some of the -- for some of the savings, a smaller portion into important initiatives for us, including around CSR and user safety, where we're putting incremental resources. 
And on top of that, as I said in my remarks, we're also spending a larger and larger portion of our revenue on App Store fees given that more of our payers are coming in through the App Stores. That probably creates about 1 point or so of margin headwind for us, but we're offsetting that by being -- by operating leverage on the sales and marketing side. So I'd say those probably wash out and are relatively neutral. 
And then the last kind of put and take that I would point you to is what I mentioned about Google's previously announced requirement to use their in-app payment system, which they're supposed to put into effect at the end of March. Frankly, it's really difficult for me to fathom Google making that policy change, given all the legal and regulatory pressures that they're facing. And recall that they delayed this policy once before. They've made exceptions for it in certain markets. So we'll see how that plays out, but that's kind of my thinking around that at this point in time. 
So hopefully, that's helpful on the margin side. I'm sorry, what was the second question, around Japan and other markets?"

So it's a meaningful number when you aggregate the effect on our 2021 in Japan versus what we were thinking. And that's going to carry through into 2022 because, as Shar said, that market has nowhere near gone back to normal. 
Aside from Japan, there's a couple of other markets in Asia. Korea is also very strictly enforcing restrictions around the pandemic. And so that's another market which has clearly not gone back to normal. And there's other ones in Asia as well that are smaller for us. Even India hasn't fully bounced back. As an example, it's better than it was at the depths, but it's improved meaningful, but it's still down significantly from pre-pandemic. So there's a number of markets, especially across Asia, where there are some lingering effect, but Japan is really the most meaningful one for us."

And the goal now is to have new and personalized experiences that are fun, interactive, useful in helping spark connections. And we've already got 70% of our users adopting the experience, and we're seeing high levels of engagement and likes, messages and conversations. So looking ahead, our plan is to continuously launch and feature a variety of novel and engaging experiences here. 
We talked about the music mode launch in the letter. Soon to come, for example, is going to be an experience that's a fun rip on the classic blind date experience. Explore also allows us to have geographically tailored programming. So in Brazil, we're about to launch Carnival mode on Valentine's Day. It's going to be an Explore experience that allows members to opt in to match with others that are celebrating Carnival in their major cities like Rio, Sao Paulo, Salvador, et cetera. And people can share their favorite parties, where they're traveling to. Carnival is the most important cultural moment in Brazil, and it's a moment that connects people. And it's a great example of how Explore enables a fluid virtual to -- in real life experience. 
So additionally, as you can imagine, this new surface area with these Explore tiles also provides us opportunities for integrations with third parties to drive sort of new experiences in the app and offline. And it gives people a reason to keep coming back and check out these new experiences. 
And then as this -- the adoption and engagement on the surface area increases, it does provide new opportunities to us to merchandise revenue features, both existing and new revenue features. So that's why we're so excited about this whole new surface area that we've created."

First of all, I would just point out that as a general matter, it's not unusual for us to see kind of limited sequential growth in payers Q4 over Q3. So overall, the trend is not atypical for us. And then I would point out to a number of factors to think about as you look at the Q4 payers numbers and results. 
The first, what you rightly point out, is Omicron, right? We saw a spike kind of in that early part of December, especially in some of the Western markets, and it did affect our payer numbers starting in December. So there was a change in trend after Omicron burst onto the scene. And so that's a big part of what happened in the end of Q4. 
We've called out many times kind of the lingering COVID impacts we see in some markets that haven't returned back to normal, Asia, particularly Japan. That's another factor around payers and the performance in Q4. 
And then I also mentioned that we had reduced marketing spend because we just couldn't hit our ROI hurdles, especially in some of our marketing heavy brands. Match, as an example, and others of the established brands were impacted in Q4 as we pulled back on marketing spend to protect our return expectation. So those things, I think, together are the key trends that we saw. 
Looking at Q1, we're not expecting a massive shift in some of those things. We still have Omicron lingering. We feel like we're getting closer to the end. But it continues to be an issue in a number of markets. And as we said in the earlier remarks, it hasn't even really worked its way through the Asia markets, Korea, Japan. They've got the hatches battened down to prepare for it, and that's going to affect people's behavior in those markets. So while we're moving through it in the West, you still got to go through it in some of the Asian markets. And so that's going to be an effect here in early 2022. And then hopefully, we'll get through this and we'll have an inflection point in the pandemic and in the impact on people's social lives and dating. 
The only other thing which I just want to add is that -- and we say this all the time, we don't manage our results for specific payer growth or RPP growth or whatever. We're managing it for revenue growth. And so we are making trade-offs all the time in terms of price optimizations and so forth. And so that does move the payers numbers around. I called out one in my remarks around discounting at Tinder, that we're adjusting policies there. So you're going to continue to see us make those decisions. That could have effects on payer numbers, but ultimately, we think are the right thing to do for the business and certainly to grow revenue the way we want to grow revenue."

And that sort of reflects in how rich the profile is, the way you consume them, the way you communicate on the platform. And the team has kept innovating and pulling ahead of competition every year. The way they implemented audio, which basic audio, for instance, but they did it in the form of Voice Prompts, and how that became such a resonant in socially viral feature is an example of how they approach product development. And this particular product, I think, has a pretty big resonance among a large segment of audience. It is differentiated in the market. And that's what gives us confidence about the international rollout. 
On monetization specifically, Hinge has made real progress on RPP, as you know, this past year. And we certainly don't think it's near its ceiling. But our expectation this year in 2022 is for Hinge to do over $300 million in revenue. And it's going to be driven by both strong payer growth as well as continued growth in RPP, I think."

So look, I would say that our outlook for right now is assuming that we gradually come out of the Omicron impacts by geography, first, in the West, Europe and the U.S. and then ultimately, in Asia. And I think that's going to take some time into the second quarter. A little hard to tell if maybe Asia handles things differently once they've seen what people have done over here. But right now, that's our assumption. 
And as we come out of the Omicron impact, what we're assuming is that activity behavior goes back to pre-Omicron levels, but not back to pre-pandemic levels. So kind of the fog of Omicron lifts, and we go back to where we thought we were in October of last year as opposed to where we were in 2019, as an example. 
Now that could be a wrong assumption because I don't know how people are going to behave depending on how confident they feel, how much of an end we reached evolve this, let's say, sometime in the spring. And so that is a swing factor in our outlook, but we're not assuming a huge summer of love right now in our outlook. That would clearly provide upside or at least the ability to reach the higher ends of the outlook, if that happened. 
I think it's entirely possible. I know a lot of people feel like as soon as we get to those warm summer months, there's going to be a real big wave, but we're not forecasting that at the moment until we see some evidence that really this is over, and that is how people are going to behave, but we'll have to wait and see. 
Right now, we're more sober on our forecast because we've been head-faked a few times, and this has been going on for a long time, and no one's had a great ability to predict kind of what the pandemic brings and what the effects are. 
So that's how we're forecasting, but we remain very optimistic that people are going to want to go out and date and socialize in big numbers once they feel the risk is down and they're ready to do that. And we clearly have not gotten to that yet. We're hoping it happens kind of in the summer months, spring and summer months, but remains to be seen. 
I would also just say on our forecast that we don't have a significant amount included for kind of key new initiatives that Tinder -- the Tinder virtual goods as an example. We don't have a lot included for Hinge International because those are really more '23 items in our minds than 2022. But to the extent we're able to accelerate some of those or we see bigger impact early on than we are currently anticipating, that could also be a swing factor on our second half, on our overall 2022. So those are some of the puts and takes there. 
We're trying to quantify how much Japan has cost us. As I said, we've got the #1 and #2 apps. Our Pairs app has felt a significant amount of impact. Tinder has felt some. I don't have a great estimate, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's $35 million, $40 million of impact on our 2021 that we would have seen that revenue had Japan been operating more normally. So it is a big market for us. It's a big contributor, and the impact is pretty meaningful. And I don't think we're going to get that recovery really in the first half of this year. We'll see if we get it in the second half."

But obviously, we're going to look at how to deploy any changes they make. We have the ability to return some of that to customers in the form of discounting to them. We also will have higher return on our marketing spend because we'll be paying less to the Stores. And so we'll be able to spend more into marketing, which should enhance our growth. So there's a number of things that we can do with any savings that we achieve from the App Stores over time. 
And like we said, we remain optimistic that some of that's coming, but this is a slow process on the regulatory front. And so right now, we have not made any further assumptions around that in our numbers for 2022."

I think you had questions about sort of what are the key legislations around the world. So there has been a lot of momentum on this issue. Mandatory IAP is now deemed illegal in South Korea and more recently, in Netherlands under both Dutch and more importantly, EU law. It has been surprising to see Apple's response of noncompliance in these countries despite the EUR 5 million per week fine they are now subject to in Netherlands. 
More consequentially, here in the U.S., just end of last week, 35 state attorney generals and the DOJ filed an amicus brief supporting Epic's position and opined that, that decision was wrongly decided. 
Also this week, the Open App Markets Act, that addresses App Store policies, including IAP, which seems to have bipartisan support in the Senate, is expected to move out of committee, hopefully, this week. So there's little that both sides agree to these days. The fact that this has such bipartisan support shows how unfair and inequitable some of these policies are deemed to be. 
So as Gary said, the timing of all of this regulation and legislative changes are hard to predict. It is the single -- the App Store fees are the single biggest expense line for us at the moment. They exceeded $550 million last year. They're going to increase meaningfully this year. And we remain optimistic that change is coming. And obviously, there's a lot of good we can do with that in addition to margin expansion, reinvestment, et cetera."

So we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of months. But that's how I sort of handicap just given where the trends are blowing, which are very, very clear, as Shar said.

First of all, we continue to make great, great progress working with Hyperconnect. We have a lot of confidence in the team and their innovation. Our teams are collaborating really well globally. We're learning from them. They're learning from us. So it's really going well from that standpoint. And we think they are very quick on product. They're innovative. They move fast. So that's all great from our perspective. 
In terms of investment, we continue to look at that. We are investing and adding people to help them build some of the things that we want to plug in across our apps. And all of that is kind of baked into our numbers for the year. And as I said, Hyperconnect is going to be better than breakeven even with all of that investment included. So we'll continue to hopefully see margins improve from there as we get the operating leverage on the investment and on their capabilities. 
In terms of kind of what's happened so far, just to give you some concrete examples, we rolled audio and video rooms and one-to-one video chat using their technology on to 2 of our apps, Match and Meetic, thus far. If you use the European business, Meetic, as the example, what we call the live cafe with audio and video, has been really well received by their user base. Usage of the features continues to grow. People are returning to engage with the product. The feedback is very positive. And so we're very excited about how that's all going. And in fact, we're planning a major live event at Meetic on the technology for Valentine's Day. So that's another good example of an event that's coming up that uses the technology and to be current. 
So that's an example of kind of engagement and how that's going, and Meetic and Hyperconnect are continuing to build out capabilities and features and working hand in glove. And so it's great not only for the user base, but also going well from a collaborative standpoint. 
At Match, if you want to use that as an example, we did replace a third-party vendor's technology on the video side with Hyperconnect. And so not only did that lead to some cost savings for us, but also, it means we have much more responsiveness to changes we want to make and things we want to try. We think the product overall is much better using Hyperconnect. And so having that in-house has led to not only cost savings, which you asked about, but also benefits in terms of the overall quality that we're excited about. 
So when you look at both what's happened at Match and Meetic with Hyperconnect technology, thus far, we're extremely encouraged. And what that's doing is it's leading us to have more confidence to roll that out on more of our apps. And so we're planning to bring that out into our Pairs app and a part of it into our Plenty of Fish app over the coming time. And so we'll continue to roll it out across the portfolio. 
And as you alluded to, we are thinking about what we might do at Tinder. And so more to come on that topic. But obviously, there's great potential there if we can find some things to leverage from Hyperconnect into the Tinder platform, and we are looking at that. We think Explore provides a great place to try some of those features and technologies. 
So much, much more to come, but I think from a collaborative standpoint, from a using-their-technology standpoint across our apps, things are tracking according to plan, if not maybe ahead of it, and it's really going as well as we could have expected. Hopefully that answers your question."

And so that sort of what metaverse allows us to do and why we think that's relevant in our world. 
Imagine sort of a virtual club in the app where your digital self can walk around, check out live, different rooms. They meet others listening to the same music. You can strike up a conversation with someone. You can tap and check out their full profile. You can like them, message them later. And so that's sort of the -- how we envision the metaverse experience leading to the dating context and the dating experience in our app. 
Now in terms of the types of underlying technology that's needed to enable these experiences, this is what the Hyperconnect team has been innovating on, right? Beyond just the real-time live, low-latency video, audio technology that they have, there are additional technology elements, everything from what's -- the pieces of the virtual human technology, the virtual world technology, also live audio and video connection based on location -- connections that are based on locations on a map, for instance, and so on.

And as I've said, we're focusing more on some of the Asian markets where we're seeing better performance. Despite COVID, I think the Asian markets, Korea, Japan, have been better for Hyperconnect than some of the Middle Eastern markets. So we're adjusting focus. We're helping them in a few fronts, and that seems to be starting to pay off, both on the marketing side as well as on the product side. And we've had teams focused on this now for a little while. And so we're seeing improvement. And they've innovated with some new product features that seem to be working. So that's giving us some optimism going into 2022, more work to do. 
Right now, where -- our outlook is still is for a relatively flat performance in Q1 and Q2 on the Hyperconnect side. And we think as these initiatives and more to come start to bear fruit, we'll start to see a reacceleration of growth into Q3 and Q4 in the back half of the year. And that, of course, doesn't include all the great stuff they're doing for us across the portfolio, which is meaningful as well. 
So we feel great about how Hyperconnect's going. And we know there's more work to do, and we're very focused on it at this point. 
I think that that's it, given that we're getting close to the bottom of the hour. So really appreciate everybody joining for this call. I hope everyone stays well and safe out there. And we look forward to talking to you in the warm spring months in May, where we'll be looking forward to a great summer. Thanks very much."

You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be do",1053,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. 
You know, this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And as much as we'd hope to be done with COVID in 2021, the recent Omicron surge is a reminder that we aren't quite at the end yet, although I sure hope we're close.  
So our business grew 25% (sic) [ 24% ] in revenue despite the waves of Delta and more recently, Omicron. And this latest Omicron surge has impacted peak season behaviors and dating sentiment in parts of the world. And because these surges have had varying effects on our business, I thought I would start by sort of level-setting where our business is in the context of the pandemic.  
So if you recall, back in 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, our business took a hit during the global lockdowns, and it then stabilized by late spring. And at that time, both user activity and propensity to pay slowly recovered. And as we've dealt with different waves of COVID since, usually, the mobility restrictions are generally impacted dating activity. And now fast forward 2 years, while much of the Western markets, including the U.S., are seeing less and less impact to activity and propensity to pay with these ongoing surges, several markets, particularly in Asia, are still disproportionately impacted.  
Japan, for instance, has now dealt with 3 periods of state of emergency last year, all of which have had a meaningful impact to mobility and general dating sentiment. And there seems to be a glimmer of hope after that last one was lifted. But again, Omicron has them back in a quasi state of emergency at least until February 20. And all of this has led to a level of anxiety and fatigue, particularly in these winter months, and we're seeing the effects of this in Japan and parts of Asia.  
Now beyond these geographic differences, as we've said before a few times, while active online daters and propensity to metrics have largely recovered in Western markets, there is still a hesitancy among new users who have never tried dating apps before to break into the category. Now these are usually largely driven by word of mouth, and that, of course, depends on normal levels of socializing, which hasn't yet happened. And if you've resisted online dating until now, the pandemic hardly seems the right time to start. So this past year, we have seen periodic uptakes in new entrants when COVID is not dominating the news cycle. But by and large, that has not fully recovered in a sustained way.  
So unlike categories like, say, online groceries, for instance, where pandemic pulled forward new users, for us, nonusers breaking into the category, even at a normal cadence, is still to come. And we feel optimistic that if Omicron truly is what causes the shift from a pandemic to endemic, and if things do indeed return to more normal in spring and summer, we are well positioned to be able to capitalize on it. 
We've made a significant progress in building out our portfolio of products that appeal to different demographics and intent. We've innovated on many pain points, everything from trust and safety to more authentic discovery and getting to know each other experiences. We've been disciplined and measured in our marketing efforts given the macro climate, but we're ready with several creative and optimistic campaigns to reenergize dating sentiment as soon as we are in a new post-pandemic normal. You know romance and love may be just the thing that shakes us out of this collective malaise.  
Now Tinder, beyond a 22% (sic) [ 23% ] revenue growth, in 2021, Tinder released its biggest update since the invention of the Swipe feature, and this was the launch of Tinder Explore. Explore provides Tinder with additional flexibility to expand use cases to more dimensions of discovery and social live experiences. Explore enhances responsiveness, offers surface and opportunity for regionally tailored experiences; has exciting media, video dating hybrids such as Swipe Night, Wedding Dates, concert Festival Mode; and it's clearly had a productive start with almost 70% of users adopting this experience.  
The 2022 road map has many more enhancements planned, along with new monetization opportunities later in the year.  
Hinge. Hinge has had an impressive year where they more than doubled revenue. They're also seeing a strong start to 2022 in markets they've been around at, like the U.K. and Australia. And the Voice Prompts feature they launched late last year has really resonated with users, not to mention the social virality this has seen. It turns out people's life goals, dating styles and their best dad jokes are both entertaining and insightful. Our 2022 plan for Hinge, to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets, remains intact.  
We're also making progress at Hyperconnect and stabilizing the core business, and we plan to return them to growth later this year. They have recently launched a Azar lounge, their live streaming feature, and Hakuna city, their interactive and immersive new discovery experience. And they continue to experiment with metaverse elements, both in dating and social discovery context.  
We've also successfully integrated Hyperconnect's live video and audio tech on a couple of our platforms. And the teams are making progress, enabling our other brands to leverage their technology more broadly to build new immersive discovery and live experiences. While much remains to be done at Hyperconnect, we're actually very confident it is on the right track, and it is pushing us forward in a number of areas that are critical to our long-term growth.  
As I reflect on last year, what jumps out to me has been our ability to find opportunities in the face of uncertainty. And despite this latest Omicron surge and all the uncertainty it may create over the next couple of months, I am hopeful about 2022 how we're going to use technology and innovate product experiences; tell our story with ever more creative marketing; and most importantly, profoundly change many more lives around the world.  
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some color on the quarter and the full year."

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year.

We had a strong Q4 with total revenue of $806 million, up 24% year-over-year. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened meaningfully against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $12 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, total revenue would have been $818 million, up 26% year-over-year. We did not anticipate about $9 million of FX headwind when we provided our outlook in early November.  
Our direct revenue grew 24% year-over-year. It grew 21% in the Americas, an acceleration from last quarter; 16% in Europe; and 46% in APAC and Other. We did feel some COVID impacts on our business, particularly from the emergence of the Omicron variant, which severely reduced mobility in a number of markets starting in December. COVID continues to be a meaningful overhang on our Japanese business and in certain other markets.  
Total payers were 16.2 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 10% year-over-year in both the Americas and Europe, and 36% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect.  
RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.16 in Q4. RPP was up a solid 10% in the Americas, 6% in Europe, and 7% in APAC and Other. 
Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $444 million, up 23% year-over-year, an acceleration over Q3's rate. Tinder had payers growth of 18% year-over-year, adding 1.6 million payers to 10.6 million, and RPP growth of 4% year-over-year in the quarter.  
Tinder Platinum subscribers comprised approximately 13% of total Tinder subscribers, exceeding 1 million in aggregate. 
Tinder active user growth continues to be strong, with the brand achieving a record number of active users on its platform globally in 2021. Engagement on the platform also continues to be robust with several KPIs such as daily swipes and messages at or near all-time highs in Q4.  
All other brands grew direct revenue 26% year-over-year in Q4, driven by 16% RPP growth and 9% payers growth. Hinge was the standout among this group, growing direct revenue approximately 90% year-over-year, driven by RPP growth of 60% to nearly $24 and reaching about 850,000 payers. BLK, Chispa and Upward in aggregate grew direct revenue over 70% year-over-year in Q4.  
Hyperconnect contributed about $50 million of total revenue in the quarter. The business saw improved performance in December compared to preceding months. It was also significantly impacted in the quarter by FX, especially against the Turkish lira as Turkey is a large market for Hyperconnect.  
Indirect revenue reached $18 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. This was off a very strong Q4 2020. 
Q4 operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $232 million for margins of 29%, and adjusted operating income, which we formally called adjusted EBITDA, grew 18% year-over-year to $290 million for margins of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins would have been 2.5 points higher, excluding Hyperconnect.  
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, with slightly less than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 21% year-over-year, primarily due to higher IAP fees and represented 28% of total revenue.  
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $12 million as we pulled back marketing spend across our portfolio to maintain our ROI discipline in a crowded holiday marketing environment. That did have some impact on payers, especially in our marketing-heavy brands like Match. Sales and marketing spend was down 5 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%. 
G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose 38% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in legal fees. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 2 points or $28 million year-over-year. G&A was less than we had anticipated as the former Tinder employee litigation came to a conclusion on December 1. 
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 31% year-over-year and were 8% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, primarily Tinder. 
Our gross leverage declined to 3.7x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.9x at the end of Q4, achieving the target of below 3x that we set at the time of our separation. 
We ended the quarter with $827 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We have agreed to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations. We expect to pay this amount from cash on hand in Q1 2022.  
For full year 2022, we expect the company to deliver 15% to 20% year-over-year growth, driven by another strong year for both Tinder, where we expect high-teens year-over-year growth, and Hinge. Our outlook includes approximately $85 million of negative year-over-year FX impacts on total revenue. That's approximately $60 million worse than what we expected at the time of our last earnings call in early November, which is about 2 points of growth.  
In addition to the FX impact, our revenue growth outlook is more conservative than what we shared in early November due to continued COVID impact, especially in Asia and particularly the rise of the Omicron variant, which is impacting us in the early goings of 2022. Keep in mind that we have a global business. And while we may be getting ready to move past Omicron in the U.S. and Europe, Asia still has to get through that period. So we expect our performance will continue to be somewhat impacted likely until sometime in Q2.  
In aggregate, our '22 revenue outlook has been reduced by about 3 points of growth since November due to the FX and COVID impacts. Our revenue outlook for 2022 also assumes momentum builds in the second half of the year. There remains much uncertainty about what happens next with the pandemic, but we have increased confidence that while the first part of 2022 may be tougher than we initially anticipated, the second half could be stronger. We're hopeful that once we get past the effects of Omicron, we could even have that summer of love that we had expected back in 2021 after the vaccines were introduced.  
We expect overall company margins to be roughly flat, inclusive of Hyperconnect, which we expect to be better than breakeven in 2022. For the full year, we expect 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement, excluding Hyperconnect, as we incur lower year-over-year legal expenses and lower fees on Google subscriptions, which we plan to partially reinvest in safety and CSR initiatives as well as higher employee costs given the ongoing war for talent.  
Note that despite Google's recent fee cut, which covered only subscription revenue, we actually expect to pay a greater percentage of our revenue to the App Stores in 2022 than in 2021 as more of our users come in via app. For instance, on our fast-growing Hinge app, most payers use iOS, and we pay a full 30% on that revenue.  
Our margin outlook reflects current App Store policies. Our outlook includes over $650 million of App Store fees in 2022, primarily to Apple. Our outlook does not include implementation of Google's previously announced requirement of mandatory use of its payment system starting in April 2022. Were that to happen, we'd incur approximately $50 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. 
Even though we're unable to forecast further change in App Store policies at this time, we remain optimistic that more changes to the App Store ecosystem are likely, and we will continue to update you.  
For full year 2022, we expect SBC expense of $175 million to $185 million, reflecting additional hiring and the continued competitive market for talent; CapEx of approximately $70 million, about $10 million lower than in 2021; and adjusted operating income to free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, excluding the $441 million legal settlement. We do not expect to be a material U.S. federal cash taxpayer in 2022.  
We have an initiative underway in countries where Tinder still offers age-based discounts to eliminate these discounts. These changes, which have begun in earnest in Q1, will impact Tinder payers beginning in Q1, but we expect these changes to be revenue neutral. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by year-over-year payers growth in the low to mid-teens and year-over-year RPP growth in the mid-single digits, as is typical for us. However, the effects from Omicron could shift these metrics somewhat. We anticipate about $25 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q1, meaning that growth would be more than 4 points higher on an FX-neutral basis.  
We expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to be in the high teens in Q1, and that Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver direct revenue growth over 70% year-over-year in Q1. We anticipate that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q1 at similar levels to Q4 '21.  
We expect adjusted operating income of $260 million to $265 million in Q1, representing margins in the low-30s percent range, typical for a first quarter for us despite about 2.5 points of pressure from adding Hyperconnect.  
Our company has all the ingredients to continue to deliver on our mission of helping people make meaningful connections through our technology. Tinder has an exciting product road map and a growing global user base to continue to convert. Hinge's product continues to gain traction and the business has meaningful opportunities ahead, including in many international markets. There is so much we can do with Hyperconnect, not only deploy their video and audio tech capabilities across our apps, but have them help us build exciting new metaverse dating apps and immersive user experiences, which we can potentially make use of across our portfolio. 
Our financial performance is strong with room to grow already best-in-class margins and potential App Store reform benefits. We strongly believe that the next phase of our business is going to be very exciting.  
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

First of all, as I said, our outlook for margins for this year, inclusive of Hyperconnect, is that they'd be relatively flat, which we actually think is a strong performance, especially in this environment. And Hyperconnect contributes over 1 point of margin headwind for the year. 
If you look through the puts and takes, we probably have a bit over 2 points, I would say, of margin improvement from legal expense savings and Google's reduction from 30% to 15% on subscriptions. But we're currently forecasting that we could reinvest more than half of that savings into hiring new people and in retaining our existing talent, especially in the very competitive market that we're operating in for talent right now. 
We also plan to reinvest some of the -- for some of the savings, a smaller portion into important initiatives for us, including around CSR and user safety, where we're putting incremental resources. 
And on top of that, as I said in my remarks, we're also spending a larger and larger portion of our revenue on App Store fees given that more of our payers are coming in through the App Stores. That probably creates about 1 point or so of margin headwind for us, but we're offsetting that by being -- by operating leverage on the sales and marketing side. So I'd say those probably wash out and are relatively neutral. 
And then the last kind of put and take that I would point you to is what I mentioned about Google's previously announced requirement to use their in-app payment system, which they're supposed to put into effect at the end of March. Frankly, it's really difficult for me to fathom Google making that policy change, given all the legal and regulatory pressures that they're facing. And recall that they delayed this policy once before. They've made exceptions for it in certain markets. So we'll see how that plays out, but that's kind of my thinking around that at this point in time. 
So hopefully, that's helpful on the margin side. I'm sorry, what was the second question, around Japan and other markets?"

So it's a meaningful number when you aggregate the effect on our 2021 in Japan versus what we were thinking. And that's going to carry through into 2022 because, as Shar said, that market has nowhere near gone back to normal. 
Aside from Japan, there's a couple of other markets in Asia. Korea is also very strictly enforcing restrictions around the pandemic. And so that's another market which has clearly not gone back to normal. And there's other ones in Asia as well that are smaller for us. Even India hasn't fully bounced back. As an example, it's better than it was at the depths, but it's improved meaningful, but it's still down significantly from pre-pandemic. So there's a number of markets, especially across Asia, where there are some lingering effect, but Japan is really the most meaningful one for us."

And the goal now is to have new and personalized experiences that are fun, interactive, useful in helping spark connections. And we've already got 70% of our users adopting the experience, and we're seeing high levels of engagement and likes, messages and conversations. So looking ahead, our plan is to continuously launch and feature a variety of novel and engaging experiences here. 
We talked about the music mode launch in the letter. Soon to come, for example, is going to be an experience that's a fun rip on the classic blind date experience. Explore also allows us to have geographically tailored programming. So in Brazil, we're about to launch Carnival mode on Valentine's Day. It's going to be an Explore experience that allows members to opt in to match with others that are celebrating Carnival in their major cities like Rio, Sao Paulo, Salvador, et cetera. And people can share their favorite parties, where they're traveling to. Carnival is the most important cultural moment in Brazil, and it's a moment that connects people. And it's a great example of how Explore enables a fluid virtual to -- in real life experience. 
So additionally, as you can imagine, this new surface area with these Explore tiles also provides us opportunities for integrations with third parties to drive sort of new experiences in the app and offline. And it gives people a reason to keep coming back and check out these new experiences. 
And then as this -- the adoption and engagement on the surface area increases, it does provide new opportunities to us to merchandise revenue features, both existing and new revenue features. So that's why we're so excited about this whole new surface area that we've created."

First of all, I would just point out that as a general matter, it's not unusual for us to see kind of limited sequential growth in payers Q4 over Q3. So overall, the trend is not atypical for us. And then I would point out to a number of factors to think about as you look at the Q4 payers numbers and results. 
The first, what you rightly point out, is Omicron, right? We saw a spike kind of in that early part of December, especially in some of the Western markets, and it did affect our payer numbers starting in December. So there was a change in trend after Omicron burst onto the scene. And so that's a big part of what happened in the end of Q4. 
We've called out many times kind of the lingering COVID impacts we see in some markets that haven't returned back to normal, Asia, particularly Japan. That's another factor around payers and the performance in Q4. 
And then I also mentioned that we had reduced marketing spend because we just couldn't hit our ROI hurdles, especially in some of our marketing heavy brands. Match, as an example, and others of the established brands were impacted in Q4 as we pulled back on marketing spend to protect our return expectation. So those things, I think, together are the key trends that we saw. 
Looking at Q1, we're not expecting a massive shift in some of those things. We still have Omicron lingering. We feel like we're getting closer to the end. But it continues to be an issue in a number of markets. And as we said in the earlier remarks, it hasn't even really worked its way through the Asia markets, Korea, Japan. They've got the hatches battened down to prepare for it, and that's going to affect people's behavior in those markets. So while we're moving through it in the West, you still got to go through it in some of the Asian markets. And so that's going to be an effect here in early 2022. And then hopefully, we'll get through this and we'll have an inflection point in the pandemic and in the impact on people's social lives and dating. 
The only other thing which I just want to add is that -- and we say this all the time, we don't manage our results for specific payer growth or RPP growth or whatever. We're managing it for revenue growth. And so we are making trade-offs all the time in terms of price optimizations and so forth. And so that does move the payers numbers around. I called out one in my remarks around discounting at Tinder, that we're adjusting policies there. So you're going to continue to see us make those decisions. That could have effects on payer numbers, but ultimately, we think are the right thing to do for the business and certainly to grow revenue the way we want to grow revenue."

And that sort of reflects in how rich the profile is, the way you consume them, the way you communicate on the platform. And the team has kept innovating and pulling ahead of competition every year. The way they implemented audio, which basic audio, for instance, but they did it in the form of Voice Prompts, and how that became such a resonant in socially viral feature is an example of how they approach product development. And this particular product, I think, has a pretty big resonance among a large segment of audience. It is differentiated in the market. And that's what gives us confidence about the international rollout. 
On monetization specifically, Hinge has made real progress on RPP, as you know, this past year. And we certainly don't think it's near its ceiling. But our expectation this year in 2022 is for Hinge to do over $300 million in revenue. And it's going to be driven by both strong payer growth as well as continued growth in RPP, I think."

So look, I would say that our outlook for right now is assuming that we gradually come out of the Omicron impacts by geography, first, in the West, Europe and the U.S. and then ultimately, in Asia. And I think that's going to take some time into the second quarter. A little hard to tell if maybe Asia handles things differently once they've seen what people have done over here. But right now, that's our assumption. 
And as we come out of the Omicron impact, what we're assuming is that activity behavior goes back to pre-Omicron levels, but not back to pre-pandemic levels. So kind of the fog of Omicron lifts, and we go back to where we thought we were in October of last year as opposed to where we were in 2019, as an example. 
Now that could be a wrong assumption because I don't know how people are going to behave depending on how confident they feel, how much of an end we reached evolve this, let's say, sometime in the spring. And so that is a swing factor in our outlook, but we're not assuming a huge summer of love right now in our outlook. That would clearly provide upside or at least the ability to reach the higher ends of the outlook, if that happened. 
I think it's entirely possible. I know a lot of people feel like as soon as we get to those warm summer months, there's going to be a real big wave, but we're not forecasting that at the moment until we see some evidence that really this is over, and that is how people are going to behave, but we'll have to wait and see. 
Right now, we're more sober on our forecast because we've been head-faked a few times, and this has been going on for a long time, and no one's had a great ability to predict kind of what the pandemic brings and what the effects are. 
So that's how we're forecasting, but we remain very optimistic that people are going to want to go out and date and socialize in big numbers once they feel the risk is down and they're ready to do that. And we clearly have not gotten to that yet. We're hoping it happens kind of in the summer months, spring and summer months, but remains to be seen. 
I would also just say on our forecast that we don't have a significant amount included for kind of key new initiatives that Tinder -- the Tinder virtual goods as an example. We don't have a lot included for Hinge International because those are really more '23 items in our minds than 2022. But to the extent we're able to accelerate some of those or we see bigger impact early on than we are currently anticipating, that could also be a swing factor on our second half, on our overall 2022. So those are some of the puts and takes there. 
We're trying to quantify how much Japan has cost us. As I said, we've got the #1 and #2 apps. Our Pairs app has felt a significant amount of impact. Tinder has felt some. I don't have a great estimate, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's $35 million, $40 million of impact on our 2021 that we would have seen that revenue had Japan been operating more normally. So it is a big market for us. It's a big contributor, and the impact is pretty meaningful. And I don't think we're going to get that recovery really in the first half of this year. We'll see if we get it in the second half."

We also will have higher return on our marketing spend because we'll be paying less to the Stores. And so we'll be able to spend more into marketing, which should enhance our growth. So there's a number of things that we can do with any savings that we achieve from the App Stores over time. 
And like we said, we remain optimistic that some of that's coming, but this is a slow process on the regulatory front. And so right now, we have not made any further assumptions around that in our numbers for 2022."

I think you had questions about sort of what are the key legislations around the world. So there has been a lot of momentum on this issue. Mandatory IAP is now deemed illegal in South Korea and more recently, in Netherlands under both Dutch and more importantly, EU law. It has been surprising to see Apple's response of noncompliance in these countries despite the EUR 5 million per week fine they are now subject to in Netherlands. 
More consequentially, here in the U.S., just end of last week, 35 state attorney generals and the DOJ filed an amicus brief supporting Epic's position and opined that, that decision was wrongly decided. 
Also this week, the Open App Markets Act, that addresses App Store policies, including IAP, which seems to have bipartisan support in the Senate, is expected to move out of committee, hopefully, this week. So there's little that both sides agree to these days. The fact that this has such bipartisan support shows how unfair and inequitable some of these policies are deemed to be. 
So as Gary said, the timing of all of this regulation and legislative changes are hard to predict. It is the single -- the App Store fees are the single biggest expense line for us at the moment. They exceeded $550 million last year. They're going to increase meaningfully this year. And we remain optimistic that change is coming. And obviously, there's a lot of good we can do with that in addition to margin expansion, reinvestment, et cetera."

First of all, we continue to make great, great progress working with Hyperconnect. We have a lot of confidence in the team and their innovation. Our teams are collaborating really well globally. We're learning from them. They're learning from us. So it's really going well from that standpoint. And we think they are very quick on product. They're innovative. They move fast. So that's all great from our perspective. 
In terms of investment, we continue to look at that. We are investing and adding people to help them build some of the things that we want to plug in across our apps. And all of that is kind of baked into our numbers for the year. And as I said, Hyperconnect is going to be better than breakeven even with all of that investment included. So we'll continue to hopefully see margins improve from there as we get the operating leverage on the investment and on their capabilities. 
In terms of kind of what's happened so far, just to give you some concrete examples, we rolled audio and video rooms and one-to-one video chat using their technology on to 2 of our apps, Match and Meetic, thus far. If you use the European business, Meetic, as the example, what we call the live cafe with audio and video, has been really well received by their user base. Usage of the features continues to grow. People are returning to engage with the product. The feedback is very positive. And so we're very excited about how that's all going. And in fact, we're planning a major live event at Meetic on the technology for Valentine's Day. So that's another good example of an event that's coming up that uses the technology and to be current. 
So that's an example of kind of engagement and how that's going, and Meetic and Hyperconnect are continuing to build out capabilities and features and working hand in glove. And so it's great not only for the user base, but also going well from a collaborative standpoint. 
At Match, if you want to use that as an example, we did replace a third-party vendor's technology on the video side with Hyperconnect. And so not only did that lead to some cost savings for us, but also, it means we have much more responsiveness to changes we want to make and things we want to try. We think the product overall is much better using Hyperconnect. And so having that in-house has led to not only cost savings, which you asked about, but also benefits in terms of the overall quality that we're excited about. 
So when you look at both what's happened at Match and Meetic with Hyperconnect technology, thus far, we're extremely encouraged. And what that's doing is it's leading us to have more confidence to roll that out on more of our apps. And so we're planning to bring that out into our Pairs app and a part of it into our Plenty of Fish app over the coming time. And so we'll continue to roll it out across the portfolio. 
And as you alluded to, we are thinking about what we might do at Tinder. And so more to come on that topic. But obviously, there's great potential there if we can find some things to leverage from Hyperconnect into the Tinder platform, and we are looking at that. We think Explore provides a great place to try some of those features and technologies. 
So much, much more to come, but I think from a collaborative standpoint, from a using-their-technology standpoint across our apps, things are tracking according to plan, if not maybe ahead of it, and it's really going as well as we could have expected. Hopefully that answers your question."

And so that sort of what metaverse allows us to do and why we think that's relevant in our world. 
Imagine sort of a virtual club in the app where your digital self can walk around, check out live, different rooms. They meet others listening to the same music. You can strike up a conversation with someone. You can tap and check out their full profile. You can like them, message them later. And so that's sort of the -- how we envision the metaverse experience leading to the dating context and the dating experience in our app. 
Now in terms of the types of underlying technology that's needed to enable these experiences, this is what the Hyperconnect team has been innovating on, right? Beyond just the real-time live, low-latency video, audio technology that they have, there are additional technology elements, everything from what's -- the pieces of the virtual human technology, the virtual world technology, also live audio and video connection based on location -- connections that are based on locations on a map, for instance, and so on.

I mean, I think on their performance, like we said, it did get better in December, certainly an improvement versus October and November despite the fact that we saw some real FX headwinds there. So some of that was rolling out a few things that started to show some traction, live streaming on Azar being one. 
And as I've said, we're focusing more on some of the Asian markets where we're seeing better performance. Despite COVID, I think the Asian markets, Korea, Japan, have been better for Hyperconnect than some of the Middle Eastern markets. So we're adjusting focus. We're helping them in a few fronts, and that seems to be starting to pay off, both on the marketing side as well as on the product side. And we've had teams focused on this now for a little while. And so we're seeing improvement. And they've innovated with some new product features that seem to be working. So that's giving us some optimism going into 2022, more work to do. 
Right now, where -- our outlook is still is for a relatively flat performance in Q1 and Q2 on the Hyperconnect side. And we think as these initiatives and more to come start to bear fruit, we'll start to see a reacceleration of growth into Q3 and Q4 in the back half of the year. And that, of course, doesn't include all the great stuff they're doing for us across the portfolio, which is meaningful as well. 
So we feel great about how Hyperconnect's going. And we know there's more work to do, and we're very focused on it at this point. 
I think that that's it, given that we're getting close to the bottom of the hour. So really appreciate everybody joining for this call. I hope everyone stays well and safe out there. And we look forward to talking to you in the warm spring months in May, where we'll be looking forward to a great summer. Thanks very much."

On our last call in Feb, I made a comment that this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And coming out of this first quarter, the world is in a very different place than the beginning of the year. 
Our business is not immune to the macroeconomic headwinds such as the war in Ukraine, the strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies at levels we haven't seen in a while and lingering variants of COVID-19. And despite it all, our business grew 20% in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 with strong growth across the portfolio. 
It is this strength in our core business that reminds me what makes our position in the online dating category so unique and resilient. Online dating is not an overnight fad. It is a category and a business model that has built and grown steadily over time. This is not serving a fickle user need. 
I often say this. If you look at Maslow's hierarchy of human needs, right above food, shelter and security is love and relationship. The need for relationships and dating is not going to go away. 
The market opportunity for -- ahead for dating is massive. Over 700 million connected singles around the world are eligible to use our products. And only half of the eligible TAM in the Western markets of U.S. and Western Europe have ever tried a dating app. And that number is much lower across the rest of the world. 
And while we have grown users every year that we have been a public company, there is still so much more to go do. There's really no reason why people who are single shouldn't be using dating products. But people have broken into this category steadily but slowly. Once they try it, though, they not only use multiple apps at a time. That number is around 3.5 on an average in the U.S. today. They also keep coming back when their life circumstances change, and they need us again. So I remain incredibly bullish on the category as a whole and the opportunities still ahead. 
Now back to our current business. Even with all the macro uncertainty, it is our job to execute. And by and large, we are on schedule with what we plan to deliver in 2022. 
Tinder, beyond solid 18% revenue growth in Q1, the team continues to make progress on its product road map whether that is adding new experiences into Explore or innovating on new monetization features. 
Our 2022 plan for Hinge to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets remains intact. They will be launching in Germany and dark markets before the end of the second quarter and a few more markets before the end of the year. And Hyperconnect continues to build momentum, both with its current products and with the integrations its technology is bringing into our portfolio. 
Finally, we are encouraged to see more and more green shoots around the globe as COVID fears continue to ease. Seeing improvements in markets like Japan coming out of their most recent quasi state of emergency restrictions has us cautiously optimistic about several trends we are seeing. 
And before I hand it over to Gary to provide more color on the quarter, I want to address the other [indiscernible]. After 16 years of an incredible journey of building this category and this business, I feel privileged to be able to step down from day-to-day operational role and have the time and flexibility to focus on the next chapter of my life, which I'm hoping will be the give back chapter and allows me to do things I've wanted to do for a while but didn't have the time and headspace to. 
As I said earlier, the opportunity before the company is immense. The vast majority of single people around the world have yet to try dating apps. While Match has steadily grown users, payer penetration and revenue per payers, only a small mid-teens percent of our nearly 100 million active users are payers today. And they pay less than the cost of a cup of coffee a week. There is ample runway for our brands to continue to drive growth across all of these 3 metrics. 
And there remains a huge value to entry into the category, both in the terms -- both in terms of the amount of trust and safety investment needed, but also the unique characteristics of the network effects of a successful dating pool, where balance of gender, age, other demographics, geography and intent all matter in order to produce successful outcomes for users. 
And there is no 1 better positioned to continue to capture this important opportunity than us, which brings me to Bernard and why I think he is the right next leader of the company. Bernard has a proven track record as a business, product and people leader with 20 years of experience in mobile entertainment and gaming. Not only was he instrumental in Zynga's turnaround and expansion, he drove player engagement and monetization strategies into one of the best live services in mobile today and helped Zynga's -- grow Zynga's market cap by 4x. 
He has operated a business that's very similar to ours, multi-brand, multi-platform, global markets, different life cycle brands and has driven growth successfully, both organically as well as some very successful acquisitions. He has dealt with similar challenges as ours from regulations to App Store to talent recruitment. He has a phenomenal reputation, deeply cares about products, people and culture. 
For the last 6 years, he's been working on the mission of connecting people through games. Now he gets to build on our mission of connecting single people through more fun digital experiences in their quest for dates, love relationships and marriages. 
I feel very good about the future of this company. With Bernard's energy, fresh thinking and mobile consumer experience, combined with over 70 years of dating category and business experience among the Match Group leaders and brand CEOs we have, I'm ever so excited about the next phase of this company and the category at large. 
Also, I'm not going anywhere. I will stay on the Board, continue as an adviser to the company, especially to be able to focus on areas of the business I actually love, product, strategy, solving customer problems. 
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues at Match Group, Gary and the rest of the management team, the Board and you all for your support through this 16-year journey. I came to this country alone 30 years ago in search of opportunities and a richer set of experiences. This journey has far exceeded all my expectations. Thank you. 
With that, I will hand over to Gary."
355279,1778205616,2552244,"Match Group, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 04, 2022",2022-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shar. I'm disappointed this will be our last earnings call together, but look forward to having BK join the company in time for our next call in early August. Turning to the business. We had a strong Q1 with total revenue of $799 million, up 20%",1608,"Thanks, Shar. I'm disappointed this will be our last earnings call together, but look forward to having BK join the company in time for our next call in early August. 
Turning to the business. We had a strong Q1 with total revenue of $799 million, up 20% year-over-year following a 20%-plus year-over-year quarter in Q4 as well. In Q1, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $26 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, Q1 total revenue would have been $825 million, up 24% year-over-year. 
Our direct revenue grew 20% year-over-year. It grew 16% in the Americas, 14% in Europe and 38% in APAC and Other. We weathered the effects of the Omicron spike in the Americas and Europe fairly well. We did continue to feel the effects of rising COVID cases in Asia, especially Japan, although we've seen major improvement in that market recently following the lifting of restrictions. 
European performance was impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which reduced revenue in Russia, Ukraine and several other nearby countries. There was a modest impact on our performance from the war in Q1. We estimate a roughly $10 million negative impact per quarter on our revenue as a result of the invasion moving forward. 
Total payers were 16.3 million, an increase of 13% from the prior year quarter. Payers were up 7% year-over-year in the Americas, 11% in Europe and 34% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Tinder payer additions were strong, while some of our more established brands in the Americas detracted from our overall payer growth. 
RPP was up 6% year-over-year to $16 in Q1. RPP was up a solid 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 3% in APAC and Other. The effects of FX are visible in the Europe and APAC RPP numbers. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP would have been up 9% and 10%, respectively, in Europe and APAC and Other. 
Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $441 million, up 18% year-over-year. Tinder had payers growth of 17% year-over-year, adding 1.5 million payers to 10.7 million, an RPP growth of 1% year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 22% year-over-year in Q1 driven by 14% RPP growth and 7% payers growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa contributed to drive the growth, and Hyperconnect contributed as well. Some of our established brands in the Americas saw pressure on payers in the quarter, a portion of which was attributable to a challenge to find marketing opportunities that met our ROI thresholds. 
There were a couple of other specific trends as well. At Plenty of Fish, which tends to serve a lower-income demographic, users had benefited from COVID-related government stimulus in Q1 2021, but we saw some relative payer softness in the early goings of 2022. 
The Match brand saw some payer impacts as it tested a softer paywall model in Q1. This is a short-term headwind that should be long-term beneficial as we refine the new model. 
Hyperconnect contributed just over $50 million of total revenue in the quarter generally as we expected. The business demonstrated continued improved performance, consistent with the trends we saw at the tail end of last year despite some impact of the Ukraine war on its Turkish business. 
Hyperconnect's revenue also continued to be significantly impacted by FX, especially against the Turkish lira and the yen. Indirect revenue reached $15 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year as the advertising market remains strong. Our brands have become more appealing to advertisers in the current advertising landscape. 
Q1 operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $208 million for margins of 26%, and adjusted operating income grew 19% year-over-year to $273 million for margins of 34%. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 24% year-over-year in Q1, with about 60% of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 17% year-over-year primarily due to higher App Store fees and represented 28% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $8 million year-over-year as we continue to show spending discipline in a relatively frothy marketing environment. And we spent cautiously in markets that did not show sufficient post-COVID recovery momentum. 
Sales and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 18%. G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose 7% year-over-year. G&A comprised 13% of revenue, consistent with the prior year and was up $6 million year-over-year as we continue to spend on critical initiatives like user safety. Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 28% year-over-year and were 10% of revenue, up 1 point as we increased headcount at Tinder and Hinge. 
Our gross leverage declined to 3.6x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.7x at the end of Q1. We ended the quarter with $921 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We still expect to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations from cash on hand. 
Our Board has also authorized a $12.5 million share buyback plan. For Q2, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $800 million to $810 million, which would represent 13% to 14% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by double-digit year-over-year payers growth and year-over-year RPP growth in the single digits despite the continued FX headwinds. 
We anticipate approximately $35 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q2, meaning that total revenue growth would be more than 5 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This is more than an additional point of year-over-year FX impact than we had expected at our last earnings call. 
Additionally, the negative impacts of the war in Ukraine are shaving another point of revenue growth. Excluding the effects of FX and of the war, our year-over-year growth outlook would be 19% to 20%. 
We eliminated age-based pricing discounts at Tinder late in Q1, which will impact Tinder payer growth in Q2, but revenue should be relatively unaffected. Additionally, Tinder payers will be negatively impacted by the loss of payers in Russia and Ukraine. We anticipate about 200,000 fewer payers in Q2 as a result of the age-based pricing change and the war. 
We expect Q2 RPP growth will be impacted by the continued FX pressures. We expect Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver strong revenue growth again in Q2. Hinge is on pace to expand into Germany, its first non-English-speaking geography in Q2. 
We believe that performance at Hyperconnect is improving, but expect that Q2 revenue will be impacted by the Ramadan holiday, which typically impacts Q2 results in many of Hyperconnect's markets in the Middle East. FX headwinds also continue to impact Hyperconnect, especially in Turkey and Japan. 
We expect adjusted operating income of $285 million to $290 million in Q2, representing margins of about 36% at the midpoint of the ranges. Recall that Hyperconnect reduces our margins by over 2 points. 
Our Q2 outlook assumes that we implement Google's change in policy to require use of their payment system as of June 1. We estimate a negative impact of $6 million in Q2 though we need to see actual results of implementation of the policy change to be sure of the precise impacts. 
We are currently evaluating our legal and other options to avoid the significant disruptive effect their policy change will have on our consumers. Taking into account the challenging operating environment, including the FX impact and the war in Ukraine, we now expect to be closer to the bottom end of our previously stated 15% to 20% year-over-year revenue growth range for the full year 2022. We expect a 4-point year-over-year FX impact and a 1 point impact of the war in Ukraine, meaning that growth would be 5 points higher absent those 2 factors. 
But things have been changing very quickly. At the moment, for the full year, we are estimating approximately $40 million more in year-over-year FX effects than we had at the time of our last earnings call 3 months ago, given the recent record-setting lows of the euro and yen against the U.S. dollar. 
It is clear there is a lot of uncertainty, the macro negatives but also potential positives, particularly around post-COVID reopening around the globe. This makes forward visibility challenging. Variability has clearly increased, and the trends could change meaningfully again over the next 3 months. We'll update again in August once we see what kind of summer of love we get. 
Our business serves a fundamental need for human connection. The demand for our products is unwavering and presents ample opportunity for future growth. While the macro environment poses some temporary challenges, our longer-term prospects remain bright. 
Our growth will continue to be driven by our innovative and broad portfolio of products, which is best in class at providing technologies to enable these important social connections. Moreover, we share knowledge across our portfolio, which enhances our successes and limits mistakes. 
We're disciplined on costs and very nimble, able to adjust marketing budgets on short notice. As such, we have margins and cash flow that many, if not all our peers would envy. We've shown an ability to grow consistently and to show strong profitability and cash flow. We're ready for whatever comes next and expect to continue to deliver strong growth and profitability for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And when Mandy stepped down, the Board asked me to take the CEO role. It was a unique time for the company. We had just announced the separation from IAC and wanting to become an independent company. 
At the time, it made sense to me to step up, provide the continuity and help guide the company through that process. But I have told the Board then that I couldn't commit to being a long-term CEO because of where I was in my life and the things that I wanted to do. 
I want to be able to have a chapter in my life where -- there are things that I care about that I want to make a difference outside of my professional life. Even my CEO employment agreement reflected the fact that I could step down after 18 months. 
So of course, I took over, and then COVID hit, which none of us were ready for. I am glad I was there to help us navigate through it all. And once we were out of the thick of the COVID crisis, while the Board had hoped I would change my mind and stay longer, they were prepared to work through the succession. 
So they ran a robust process. They met a diverse set of candidates. And of course, after 16 years, I wasn't going to leave until I believe we found the right successor. And Bernard is that person. 
He very quickly separated from the pack, and he impressed everyone on the Board. I'm super excited to have him as our next leader. He has -- there are many things the CEO needs, obviously, business acumen, track record of growth, product and technology sense, but also very importantly, a people -- a true people leader. 
And he has the track record. He has the mobile product and consumer experience. He has very much a growth and value creation mindset. And he is a really strong people leader as became evidenced as we talked to people he had worked with and worked for. 
He also has a very strong instinct for spotting early technology and consumer trends. And he's already experimented with and dug in and studied a lot of the new shifting technologies that are going to be meaningful to our portfolio. 
Plus, he's operated a very similar business to us, right? It's a multi-brand, multi-platform global markets, including a big Asia presence, brands that are at different stages of growth. And he's dealt with very similar challenges to us. 
So this is going to be very familiar plus he can bring a lot of his knowledge around unique characteristics of engagement and monetization on the gaming set of products, which would be very valuable for our next vector of growth. 
And as I said, I'm not going far. I am staying on the Board. I will be able to spend time on parts of the business I love. And given my role as an adviser, we felt it made sense to have Bernard start as soon as he was able to. And so the transition, Bernard officially starts on May 31. And I'm here to help him and the company in any which way I can. So I don't think there is anything to worry about on this front."

In that context, could you maybe discuss the impact on Match EBITDA outlook if Google actually moves forward with the requirement of mandatory use of Google Play billings by June? 
It looks like you already included a $6 million headwind in Q2. And I think last quarter, you talked about an incremental $50 million impact for the full year. And then longer term, how do you see the App Store fee debate evolving, given the puts and takes that you've laid out in the letter and also in light of Google's recent announcement to launch a user choice billing later this year?"

Why don't I try to take a stab at it and provide a little context of what's going on with Google as well as some of the financial impacts? 
So it's important to understand that we've had user choice on our -- on many of our platforms and brands for a long time. We maintain direct relationships with our customers that way. And in fact, our customers choose to use our payment systems, sometimes at a 3:1 ratio over the Google Play billing system. 
And Google forcing a change now really serves their interest of capturing the relationships with the customer. And I think they see a very short window now as they see the wave of regulatory change happening for them to grab that relationship with the customer before the regulatory changes disable them from doing so. 
Now we absolutely do not want to see this change in policy. But unfortunately, we're takers of the policies that Google puts on its store. We don't at all think the change is justified. We've been talking to Google for months to encourage them to allow us to continue to provide user choice. 
And yet, despite all the rulings and regulatory actions seeking to outlaw mandatory use of their payment system, they're still deciding to go ahead and require us to eliminate user choice, which we've had for many, many years. In fact, they've chosen to allow an exception to their policy to only one company, Spotify, because it served their purposes with European regulators and enabled them to take a share of Spotify subscription fees, which they had not previously been able to do. 
But in our case, they've been steadfast in removing our ability to provide user choice. Last week, Epic Games, facing a similar situation, decided to file a lawsuit against Google. We view that as a last resort and not something we take lightly in doing. 
But at the same time, the clock is ticking towards the June 1 deadline, and we need to do our best to protect our consumers' choice as well as our business. Under no circumstances do we want to see ourselves removed from the Play Store or unable to distribute through the Play Store. 
In terms of the impact, as we've disclosed, we expect their policy change to lead to an incremental approximately $6 million a month cost to us. So for the 7 months starting June 1, the total would be about $42 million in aggregate this year on top of the approximately $100 million we already expect to pay Google. That $42 million for the 7 months compares to the $50 million for 9 months we had estimated previously if the policy change had started in April. 
So it's pretty much as we expected. Now we do think that the winds of change are blowing very, very rapidly. And we think sometime late this year or next year, some of the regulations around the world are going to force Google's hand and require them to change their policy. Most notably, the DMA in Europe, which affects the entire European Union and is going to outlaw mandatory IAP. 
So while Google is making this policy change now and requiring us to eliminate user choice, ultimately, we think this is going to be very short-lived. And as the regulations change across the globe to prohibit mandatory IAP, we'll be able to return back to an environment where we have alternatives to their payment system."

Right now, we're projecting to be close to the bottom end of our previous 15% to 20% revenue growth range. And that really reflects the additional FX and Russia headwinds that we didn't see back in February when we last provided our outlook. And that's going to affect Q2 and Q3 and 4 as well. 
In terms of your specific question around the second half comps, if you look back on 2021, we had a very strong Q3, and Tinder, in particular, performed very well in Q3. So it's going to be a tougher comp for us growth-wise in Q3 of this year. 
Q4, on the other hand, presents us an easier comp. And so we expect stronger year-over-year Q4 revenue growth in 2022. I think, though, as you sit here today, there are several puts and takes that will ultimately determine how the second half looks that are a little tougher to predict. 
For example, our forecast or outlook today assumes that we get back to pre-Omicron levels of activity. And I think right now, we think that, that's where we are. We're back to pre-Omicron levels. But what we don't really know yet is are we going to get back closer to pre-pandemic level of activities back to 2019 kind of levels? 
And clearly, we're starting to see some positive signs in that direction, including a market like Japan, a very important market for us, where we've really seen significant improvement in user growth since they lifted the restrictions. And so we're expecting that kind of improvement to gradually take hold around the globe. 
And the question is exactly what levels are we going to get back to. So that's going to affect our performance in the second half of the year. And right now, still a little bit hard to predict exactly where that recovery is going to get to and how quickly. 
In terms of also our product outlook, Tinder has a very healthy product road map for the rest of the year with a lot of exciting initiatives planned in the back half. And I think that will help offset some of the macro challenges as well. 
But if you followed us for a while, you know we typically make relatively modest assumptions around the success levels of those initiatives. And we wait to see how they take hold before we predict for their success. 
And so to the extent some of the initiatives at Tinder in particular or even elsewhere in the company performed better than what we've assumed in our outlook, that would provide additional upside to the growth rates in the back half of the year."

The business actually performed really well. And our general view is this is a very small expenditure for people and perhaps one of the latter things that people cut when things are off. 
Also looking back at the early days of COVID in 2020, while we did see a sudden decline when all the news was going around, the engagement first picked back up very quickly within a few weeks. And propensity to pay also started tracking back up within a few weeks long before other broader economic indicators were recovering.

Actually, we've been performing very well from a cost perspective. We're definitely on track to deliver the 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement ex Hyperconnect that we had included in our outlook for 2022 back in February with some of the marketing spend discipline and some other spend discipline. We actually might even do a little bit better than that. 
And I think if you look at it kind of ex Hyperconnect, ex Google, margins are probably in the 38% kind of plus territory. So we feel great about how we're doing on that front. 
Unfortunately, as I mentioned in the answer to the earlier question, the Google policy change if it goes into effect at June 1 is a reasonably significant headwind to us. $42 million is kind of our estimate for the year for the 7 months of impact. And that's, what, about 1.5 points of margin. 
So it's basically eating up and maybe even a little more all the good work we're doing on spend discipline and basically eating away at that. So as I look at it, net-net for the year, including everything that we see right now, including Hyperconnect, of course, including the effect of the Google change if it comes to pass and everything else that's in the mix, my estimate would be that the company for the year probably achieves margins somewhere right in that mid-30s percent range, of course, including that 2-plus percent effect of Hyperconnect. 
It will depend a little bit on what levels of marketing spend we choose to put out there given the pace of the COVID recovery. So that's probably the swing factor. And of course, generally, the advertising market because right now, the market remains fairly expensive. And so that's leading to some of our discipline. But depending on kind of overall macroeconomic conditions, that market may adjust as the year goes on. 
So we'll have to see how that all plays out, but marketing spend will be a significant factor in our margins. But I think we feel good about how we've been disciplined so far and remain very much on track with what we expect to deliver."

As I said, the -- our total addressable market ex China, as measured by connected singles ages 18 to 65, is now over 700 million. And the vast -- in the Western markets, only half of this market has ever tried a dating product. And obviously, that number is much lower in the rest of the world. 
So that's sort of one opportunity. And usually, the cadence of nonusers breaking into the category is steady and slow driven by new products and features, new marketing campaigns, new channels and of course, word-of-mouth marketing from other successful users. 
So what became clear during COVID is the importance and efficacy of dating apps for single people as it became really one of the few choices left for -- to meet people. So now -- for now, it is a matter of us convincing the nonusers around the world to break and adopt a dating app. 
And we know that once they break into the category, they use multiple of them. And they keep coming back as their life circumstances change. One of the examples of trying to tap into some of this category resistor, for example, is our recent new [indiscernible] Stir, which taps into that unique value proposition for the single parent segment, who find it very hard to navigate mass market products and all of the things they have to go through versus self-selecting into a pool where everybody is sort of dealing with the same issues. 
While on the topic of MAU, I do want to explain something about the relevance of MAU or not in our business. Because we are an episodic churn business and unlike in an ad-supported business, for us, all MAU does not have the same value in our ecosystem. Both for user outcomes as well as monetization, it is more correlated to the balance of liquidity by gender, age, intent, location, et cetera. 
And so the -- this is why -- and one of the big things is as people, they try it once, they have success or they take a break, and they come back when the circumstances change. So even a 25-year-old brand like Match continues to have a very healthy set of reactivations through the years, right? 
So that's a sort of phenomenon that's unique to our category, I think. And to your question about monetization, so on an average, the portfolio payer penetration is around mid-teens. But our hard paywall businesses are as high as 40%. And there's also a very large variance by geography. Even for soft paywall businesses in some markets, they are well north of 25%, close to 30%. 
And so there's a fair degree of runway for us to keep innovating on the payer penetration front. As for average revenue per payer, here's the thing that we have to keep in mind. The total lifetime value amount that a payer pays us is way cheaper than a cost of a single date. 
And for people who find success on it, this is a priceless, incredibly valuable [indiscernible]. And so I do think there is a tremendous amount of innovation opportunity for us to try different things here and increase that RPP. 
One of the things I'm excited about is we've referred to the virtual goods trading platform on Tinder and this idea of collectibles. So I think -- and Bernard has particular experience with some of those mechanics. I think that will be a pretty interesting vector for us to watch out for. 
So as I look back at the history, we've been able to improve all 3 of these metrics, TAM penetration, payer penetration, revenue per payer pretty much every year. And we still have a pretty long runway ahead and a large market opportunity of users to convince to use our products."

At the time of our separation, we set some clear leverage targets, and we eliminated the buyback that we had back then to ensure that we hit those targets by the end of 2021. 
We set a net leverage target of 3x. And so now that we've hit that and actually are below that level of net leverage, it clearly makes sense for us to once again have a buyback authorization. 
At that time, we also stated our capital allocation priorities, which really haven't changed. They are to invest, number one, in our business organically. Number two, to do opportunistic M&A to fill any gaps in our portfolio or to add technologies that we think would enhance the overall portfolio. 
And we've done those kinds of acquisitions successfully on a number of occasions. If we can't find those kinds of strategically compelling M&A opportunities, then we want to return capital back to shareholders. 
And so the buyback provides us with the mechanism to have the ability to return capital back to shareholders if that makes sense. And so we think it's a good tool for us to have, an appropriate tool for us to have to use to offset dilution from employee equity awards and to take advantage of opportunities to buy our stock back cheaply in periods of market dislocation, as you point out, which is what we're experiencing right now. 
And so I think it's fair to assume that as we kind of see what's happening with the stock and with the buyback authorization in place, we'll find opportunities to go in and buy back some shares. And so we'll disclose what we do as we proceed along on that basis. But I think you are thinking about this the same way we are."

Yes. I mean, I think you're thinking about it correctly. We're basically spending where we think it makes sense to spend given the kind of post-COVID recovery dynamics and also making sure that we spend where we can hit our ROI hurdles and maintaining that discipline tightly as we always do. 
So if you look at Japan as a good example, we are holding back marketing spend in Japan because the market was not receptive. With all the restrictions, it didn't make sense to turn the spigot on significantly in Japan. 
But now by contrast that we're seeing some real recovery there, we've been spending more and running some new creative campaigns on both our Pairs brand and the Tinder brand, as we mentioned and highlight in the letter. 
The other thing that's going on is that the market in terms of marketing spend is pretty frothy at the moment. If you look at the U.S., we think the market is expensive. It slowed down significantly at the beginning of COVID, and that was a real opportunity for us to spend aggressively, and we did, but the market has really become much more expensive since that initial COVID-led downturn. 
And so it's become harder for us to hit our ROI thresholds, particularly at our marketing-heavy spend businesses like Match and Meetic, where we really maintain that ROI discipline. So if we're not seeing opportunities there to hit our hurdles on marketing spend, we're not putting the spend out there. 
And I think between IDFA, which had some impact and then the environment being strong just more generally, it's just become very challenging to hit the hurdles. The thing to watch out for, I think, though, is what happens with the overall economic picture if people start to get more nervous about where the economy is headed, and we start to see other marketers, advertising budgets get cut back or get delayed, which we often see. 
And I think we're starting to even see a few signals of that. That could present us with opportunities to, again, hit our hurdles and spend more aggressively. And so as I mentioned in the answer to Brent, that will be a swing factor as we go through the year from a margin perspective. 
So I think we're starting to see a few signs of nervousness in the market, which could be a benefit to us because as Shar said, our business tends to be economically resilient, somewhat recession-proof. And so if we start to see more opportunities to spend in the market, more opportunity to hit our hurdles, we will absolutely be nimble and take advantage of that, just like we were at the beginning of the COVID period."

Good morning, and thank you for joining the call today. On our last call in Feb, I made a comment that this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. An",1153,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call today. On our last call in Feb, I made a comment that this past year has been remarkable for Match Group in many ways, even though the broader world has been a bit disorienting at times. And coming out of this first quarter, the world is in a very different place than the beginning of the year.  
Our business is not immune to the macroeconomic headwinds such as the war in Ukraine, the strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies at levels we haven't seen in a while and lingering variants of COVID-19. And despite it all, our business grew 20% in revenue in the first quarter of 2022, with strong growth across the portfolio.  
It is this strength in our core business that reminds me what makes our position in the online dating category so unique and resilient. Online dating is not an overnight fad. It is a category and a business model that has built and grown steadily over time. This is not serving a fickle user need.  
I often say this, if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of human needs, right above food, shelter and security is love and relationship. The need for relationships and dating is not going to go away.  
The market opportunity for -- ahead for dating is massive. Over 700 million connected singles around the world are eligible to use our products. And only half of the eligible TAM in the Western markets of U.S. and Western Europe have ever tried a dating app. And that number is much lower across the rest of the world.  
And while we have grown users every year that we have been a public company, there is still so much more to go do. There's really no reason why people who are single shouldn't be using dating products. But people have broken into this category steadily but slowly. 
Once they try it, though, they not only use multiple apps at a time, that number is around 3.5 on an average in the U.S. today, they also keep coming back when their life circumstances change and they need us again. So I remain incredibly bullish on the category as a whole and the opportunities still ahead.  
Now back to our current business. Even with all the macro uncertainty, it is our job to execute. And by and large, we are on schedule with what we planned to deliver in 2022.  
Tinder, beyond solid 18% revenue growth in Q1. The team continues to make progress on its product road map, whether that is adding new experiences into Explore or innovating on new monetization features.  
Our 2022 plan for Hinge to expand internationally beyond English-speaking markets remains intact. They will be launching in Germany and DACH markets before the end of the second quarter and a few more markets before the end of the year. And Hyperconnect continues to build momentum, both with its current products and with the integrations its technology is bringing into our portfolio.  
Finally, we are encouraged to see more and more green shoots around the globe as COVID fears continue to ease. Seeing improvements in markets like Japan coming out of their most recent quasi state of emergency restrictions has us cautiously optimistic about several trends we are seeing.  
And before I hand it over to Gary to provide more color on the quarter, I want to address the other news. After 16 years of an incredible journey of building this category and this business, I feel privileged to be able to step down from day-to-day operational role and have the time and flexibility to focus on the next chapter of my life, which I'm hoping will be the give back chapter, and allows me to do things I've wanted to do for a while but didn't have the time and headspace to.  
As I said earlier, the opportunity before the company is immense. The vast majority of single people around the world have yet to try dating apps. While Match has steadily grown users, payer penetration and revenue per payers, only a small mid-teens percent of our nearly 100 million active users are payers today. And they pay less than the cost of a cup of coffee a week. There is ample runway for our brands to continue to drive growth across all of these 3 metrics.  
And there remains a huge value to entry into the category, both in the terms -- both in terms of the amount of trust and safety investment needed, but also the unique characteristics of the network effects of a successful dating pool, where balance of gender, age, other demographics, geography and intent all matter in order to produce successful outcomes for users.  
And there is no one better positioned to continue to capture this important opportunity than us, which brings me to Bernard and why I think he is the right next leader of the company. Bernard has a proven track record as a business, product and people leader, with 20 years of experience in mobile entertainment and gaming. Not only was he instrumental in Zynga's turnaround and expansion, he drove player engagement and monetization strategies into one of the best live services in mobile today and helped Zynga's -- grow Zynga's market cap by 4x.  
He has operated a business that's very similar to ours: multi-brand, multi-platform, global markets, different life cycle brands and has driven growth successfully, both organically as well as some very successful acquisitions. He has dealt with similar challenges as ours, from regulations to App Store to talent recruitment. He has a phenomenal reputation, deeply cares about products, people and culture.  
For the last 6 years, he's been working on the mission of connecting people through games. Now he gets to build on our mission of connecting single people through more fun digital experiences in their quest for dates, love, relationships and marriages.  
I feel very good about the future of this company. With Bernard's energy, fresh thinking and mobile consumer experience, combined with over 70 years of dating category and business experience among the Match Group leaders and brand CEOs we have, I'm ever so excited about the next phase of this company and the category at large.  
Also, I'm not going anywhere. I will stay on the Board, continue as an adviser to the company, especially to be able to focus on areas of the business I actually love: product, strategy, solving customer problems.  
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues at Match Group, Gary and the rest of the management team, the Board, and you all for your support through this 16-year journey. I came to this country alone 30 years ago in search of opportunities and a richer set of experiences. This journey has far exceeded all my expectations. Thank you.  
With that, I will hand over to Gary."
355279,1778205616,2552359,"Match Group, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 04, 2022",2022-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shar. I'm disappointed this will be our last earnings call together, but look forward to having BK join the company, in time for our next call in early August.  Turning to the business. We had a strong Q1, with total revenue of $799 million up 2",1609,"Thanks, Shar. I'm disappointed this will be our last earnings call together, but look forward to having BK join the company, in time for our next call in early August.  
Turning to the business. We had a strong Q1, with total revenue of $799 million up 20% year-over-year, following a 20%-plus year-over-year quarter in Q4 as well. In Q1, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against a number of global currencies, including the euro and the yen, which led to $26 million of year-over-year FX headwinds, excluding Hyperconnect. On an FX-neutral basis, Q1 total revenue would have been $825 million, up 24% year-over-year.  
Our direct revenue grew 20% year-over-year. It grew 16% in the Americas, 14% in Europe and 38% in APAC and other. We weathered the effects of the Omicron spike in the Americas and Europe fairly well. We did continue to feel the effects of rising COVID cases in Asia, especially Japan, although we've seen major improvement in that market recently following the lifting of restrictions.  
European performance was impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which reduced revenue in Russia, Ukraine and several other nearby countries. There was a modest impact on our performance from the war in Q1. We estimate a roughly $10 million negative impact per quarter on our revenue as a result of the invasion moving forward.  
Total payers were 16.3 million, an increase of 13% from the prior year quarter. Payers were up 7% year-over-year in the Americas, 11% in Europe and 34% in APAC and Other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Tinder payer additions were strong, while some of our more established brands in the Americas detracted from our overall payer growth.  
RPP was up 6% year-over-year to $16 in Q1. RPP was up a solid 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 3% in APAC and Other. The effects of FX are visible in the Europe and APAC RPP numbers. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP would have been up 9% and 10%, respectively, in Europe and APAC and Other.  
Tinder performed strongly in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $441 million, up 18% year-over-year. Tinder had payers growth of 17% year-over-year, adding 1.5 million payers to 10.7 million, an RPP growth of 1% year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX.  
All other brands grew direct revenue 22% year-over-year in Q1, driven by 14% RPP growth and 7% payers growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa contributed to drive the growth, and Hyperconnect contributed as well. Some of our established brands in the Americas saw pressure on payers in the quarter, a portion of which was attributable to a challenge to find marketing opportunities that met our ROI thresholds.  
There were a couple of other specific trends as well. At Plenty of Fish, which tends to serve a lower-income demographic, users had benefited from COVID-related government stimulus in Q1 2021, but we saw some relative payer softness in the early goings of 2022.  
The Match brand saw some payer impacts as it tested a softer paywall model in Q1. This is a short-term headwind that should be long-term beneficial as we refine the new model.  
Hyperconnect contributed just over $50 million of total revenue in the quarter, generally as we expected. The business demonstrated continued improved performance, consistent with the trends we saw at the tail end of last year despite some impact of the Ukraine war on its Turkish business. Hyperconnect's revenue also continued to be significantly impacted by FX, especially against the Turkish lira and the yen. 
Indirect revenue reached $15 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year as the advertising market remains strong. Our brands have become more appealing to advertisers in the current advertising landscape. Q1 operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $208 million for margins of 26%, and adjusted operating income grew 19% year-over-year to $273 million for margins of 34%. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 24% year-over-year in Q1, with about 60% of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 17% year-over-year, primarily due to higher App Store fees, and represented 28% of total revenue.  
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $8 million year-over-year as we continue to show spending discipline in a relatively frothy marketing environment. And we spent cautiously in markets that did not show sufficient post-COVID recovery momentum. Sales and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 18%. 
G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose 7% year-over-year. G&A comprised 13% of revenue, consistent with the prior year, and was up $6 million year-over-year as we continue to spend on critical initiatives like user safety. Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 28% year-over-year and were 10% of revenue, up 1 point as we increased headcount at Tinder and Hinge.  
Our gross leverage declined to 3.6x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 2.7x at the end of Q1. We ended the quarter with $921 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We still expect to pay $441 million to settle the former Tinder employee litigation and all related claims and arbitrations from cash on hand. Our Board has also authorized a $12.5 million share buyback plan. 
For Q2, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $800 million to $810 million, which would represent 13% to 14% year-over-year growth. We expect this to be driven by double-digit year-over-year payers growth and year-over-year RPP growth in the single digits despite the continued FX headwinds.  
We anticipate approximately $35 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q2, meaning that total revenue growth would be more than 5 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This is more than an additional point of year-over-year FX impact than we had expected at our last earnings call. Additionally, the negative impacts of the war in Ukraine are shaving another point of revenue growth. Excluding the effects of FX and of the war, our year-over-year growth outlook would be 19% to 20%.  
We eliminated age-based pricing discounts at Tinder late in Q1, which will impact Tinder payer growth in Q2, but revenue should be relatively unaffected. Additionally, Tinder payers will be negatively impacted by the loss of payers in Russia and Ukraine. We anticipate about 200,000 fewer payers in Q2 as a result of the age-based pricing change and the war. We expect Q2 RPP growth will be impacted by the continued FX pressures. 
We expect Hinge will remain on its growth trajectory and deliver strong revenue growth again in Q2. Hinge is on pace to expand into Germany, its first non-English-speaking geography in Q2.  
We believe that performance at Hyperconnect is improving, but expect that Q2 revenue will be impacted by the Ramadan holiday, which typically impacts Q2 results in many of Hyperconnect's markets in the Middle East. FX headwinds also continue to impact Hyperconnect, especially in Turkey and Japan.  
We expect adjusted operating income of $285 million to $290 million in Q2, representing margins of about 36% at the midpoint of the ranges. Recall that Hyperconnect reduces our margins by over 2 points.  
Our Q2 outlook assumes that we implement Google's change in policy to require use of their payment system as of June 1. We estimate a negative impact of $6 million in Q2, though we need to see actual results of implementation of the policy change to be sure of the precise impacts. We are currently evaluating our legal and other options to avoid the significant disruptive effect their policy change will have on our consumers. 
Taking into account the challenging operating environment, including the FX impacts and the war in Ukraine, we now expect to be closer to the bottom end of our previously stated 15% to 20% year-over-year revenue growth range for the full year 2022. We expect a 4-point year-over-year FX impact and a 1 point impact of the war in Ukraine, meaning that growth would be 5 points higher absent those 2 factors.  
But things have been changing very quickly. At the moment, for the full year, we are estimating approximately $40 million more in year-over-year FX effects than we had at the time of our last earnings call 3 months ago, given the recent record-setting lows of the euro and yen against the U.S. dollar.  
It is clear there is a lot of uncertainty, the macro negatives but also potential positives, particularly around post-COVID reopening around the globe. This makes forward visibility challenging. Variability has clearly increased, and the trends could change meaningfully again over the next 3 months. We'll update again in August once we see what kind of summer of love we get.  
Our business serves a fundamental need for human connection. The demand for our products is unwavering and presents ample opportunity for future growth. While the macro environment poses some temporary challenges, our longer-term prospects remain bright.  
Our growth will continue to be driven by our innovative and broad portfolio of products, which is best in class at providing technologies to enable these important social connections. Moreover, we share knowledge across our portfolio, which enhances our successes and limits mistakes.  
We're disciplined on costs and very nimble, able to adjust marketing budgets on short notice. As such, we have margins and cash flow that many, if not all, of our peers would envy. We've shown an ability to grow consistently and to show strong profitability and cash flow. We're ready for whatever comes next and expect to continue to deliver strong growth and profitability for our shareholders.  
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And when Mandy stepped down, the Board asked me to take the CEO role. It was a unique time for the company. We had just announced the separation from IAC and wanting to become an independent company.  
At the time, it made sense for me to step up, provide the continuity and help guide the company through that process. But I have told the Board then that I couldn't commit to being a long-term CEO because of where I was in my life and the things that I wanted to do.  
I want to be able to have a chapter in my life where there are things that I care about that I want to make a difference outside of my professional life. Even my CEO employment agreement reflected the fact that I could step down after 18 months.  
So of course, I took over, and then COVID hit, which none of us were ready for. I am glad I was there to help us navigate through it all. And once we were out of the thick of the COVID crisis, while the Board had hoped I would change my mind and stay longer, they were prepared to work through the succession.  
So they ran a robust process. They met a diverse set of candidates. And of course, after 16 years, I wasn't going to leave until I believed we found the right successor. And Bernard is that person.  
He very quickly separated from the pack, and he impressed everyone on the Board. I'm super excited to have him as our next leader. He has -- there are many things that the CEO needs, obviously, business acumen, track record of growth, product and technology sense, but also, very importantly, a people -- a true people leader.  
And he has the track record. He has the mobile product and consumer experience. He has very much a growth and value creation mindset. And he is a really strong people leader as became evidenced as we talked to people he had worked with and worked for.  
He also has a very strong instinct for spotting early technology and consumer trends. And he's already experimented with and dug in and studied a lot of the new shifting technologies that are going to be meaningful to our portfolio.  
Plus, he's operated a very similar business to us, right? It's a multi-brand, multi-platform global markets, including a big Asia presence, brands that are at different stages of growth. And he's dealt with very similar challenges to us. So this is going to be very familiar, plus he can bring a lot of his knowledge around unique characteristics of engagement and monetization on the gaming set of products, which would be very valuable for our next vector of growth.  
And as I said, I'm not going far. I am staying on the Board. I will be able to spend time on parts of the business I love. And given my role as an adviser, we felt it made sense to have Bernard start as soon as he was able to. And so for transition, Bernard officially starts on May 31, and I'm here to help him and the company in any which way I can. So I don't think there is anything to worry about on this front."

In that context, could you maybe discuss the impact on Match EBITDA outlook if Google actually moves forward with the requirement of mandatory use of Google Play billings by June?  
It looks like you already included a $6 million headwind in Q2. And I think last quarter, you talked about an incremental $50 million impact for the full year. And then longer term, how do you see the App Store fee debate evolving, given the puts and takes that you've laid out in the letter and also in light of Google's recent announcement to launch a user choice billing later this year?"

Why don't I try to take a stab at it and provide a little context of what's going on with Google as well as some of the financial impacts?

Why don't I try to take a stab at it and provide a little context of what's going on with Google as well as some of the financial impacts?  
So it's important to understand that we've had user choice on our -- on many of our platforms and brands for a long time. We maintain direct relationships with our customers that way. And in fact, our customers choose to use our payment systems, sometimes at a 3:1 ratio over the Google Play billing system.  
And Google forcing a change now really serves their interest of capturing the relationships with the customer. And I think they see a very short window now as they see the wave of regulatory change happening for them to grab that relationship with the customer before the regulatory changes disable them from doing so.  
Now we absolutely do not want to see this change in policy. But unfortunately, we're takers of the policies that Google puts on its store. We don't at all think the change is justified. We've been talking to Google for months to encourage them to allow us to continue to provide user choice. And yet, despite all the rulings and regulatory actions seeking to outlaw mandatory use of their payment system, they're still deciding to go ahead and require us to eliminate user choice, which we've had for many, many years. 
In fact, they've chosen to allow an exception to their policy to only one company, Spotify, because it served their purposes with European regulators and enabled them to take a share of Spotify subscription fees, which they had not previously been able to do. But in our case, they've been steadfast in removing our ability to provide user choice. 
Last week, Epic Games, facing a similar situation, decided to file a lawsuit against Google. We view that as a last resort and not something we take lightly in doing. But at the same time, the clock is ticking towards the June 1 deadline, and we need to do our best to protect our consumers' choice as well as our business. Under no circumstances do we want to see ourselves removed from the Play Store or unable to distribute through the Play Store. 
In terms of the impact, as we've disclosed, we expect their policy change to lead to an incremental approximately $6 million a month cost to us. So for the 7 months starting June 1, the total would be about $42 million in aggregate this year on top of the approximately $100 million we already expect to pay Google. That $42 million for the 7 months compares to the $50 million for 9 months we had estimated previously if the policy change had started in April. So it's pretty much as we expected. 
Now we do think that the winds of change are blowing very, very rapidly. And we think sometime late this year or next year, some of the regulations around the world are going to force Google's hand and require them to change their policy. Most notably, the DMA in Europe, which affects the entire European Union and is going to outlaw mandatory IAP. 
So while Google is making this policy change now and requiring us to eliminate user choice, ultimately, we think this is going to be very short-lived. And as the regulations change across the globe to prohibit mandatory IAP, we'll be able to return back to an environment where we have alternatives to their payment system."

Right now, we're projecting to be close to the bottom end of our previous 15% to 20% revenue growth range. And that really reflects the additional FX and Russia headwinds that we didn't see back in February when we last provided our outlook. And that's going to affect Q2 and Q3 and 4 as well. 
In terms of your specific question around the second half comps, if you look back on 2021, we had a very strong Q3. And Tinder, in particular, performed very well in Q3. So it's going to be a tougher comp for us growth-wise in Q3 of this year. 
Q4, on the other hand, presents us an easier comp. And so we expect stronger year-over-year Q4 revenue growth in 2022. I think, though, as you sit here today, there are several puts and takes that will ultimately determine how the second half looks that are a little tougher to predict. 
For example, our forecast or outlook today assumes that we get back to pre-Omicron levels of activity. And I think right now, we think that, that's where we are. We're back to pre-Omicron levels. But what we don't really know yet is are we going to get back closer to pre-pandemic level of activities, back to 2019 kind of levels? 
And clearly, we're starting to see some positive signs in that direction, including a market like Japan, a very important market for us, where we've really seen significant improvement in user growth since they lifted their restrictions. And so we're expecting that kind of improvement to gradually take hold around the globe. 
And the question is exactly what levels are we going to get back to? So that's going to affect our performance in the second half of the year. And right now, still a little bit hard to predict exactly where that recovery is going to get to and how quickly. 
In terms of also our product outlook, Tinder has a very healthy product road map for the rest of the year, with a lot of exciting initiatives planned in the back half. And I think that will help offset some of the macro challenges as well. 
But if you followed us for a while, you know we typically make relatively modest assumptions around the success levels of those initiatives. And we wait to see how they take hold before we predict for their success. 
And so to the extent some of the initiatives at Tinder, in particular, or even elsewhere in the company performed better than what we've assumed in our outlook, that would provide additional upside to the growth rates in the back half of the year."

And if you look at propensity to pay, in 2008, we didn't really see much of anything. The business actually performed really well. And our general view is this is a very small expenditure for people and perhaps one of the latter things that people cut when things are off. 
Also, looking back at the early days of COVID in 2020, while we did see a sudden decline when all the news was going around, the engagement first picked back up very quickly within a few weeks. And propensity to pay also started tracking back up within a few weeks, long before other broader economic indicators were recovering. 
And so we're watching for signs even now. We're not really -- haven't seen anything yet and not seeing anything. We'll keep a close eye. Our expectation, though, is our business is generally resilient during economic downturns because it does service this very fundamental human need."

Actually, we've been performing very well from a cost perspective. We're definitely on track to deliver the 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement, ex Hyperconnect, that we had included in our outlook for 2022 back in February. With some of the marketing spend discipline and some other spend discipline, we actually might even do a little bit better than that. 
And I think if you look at it kind of ex Hyperconnect, ex Google, margins are probably in the 38% kind of plus territory. So we feel great about how we're doing on that front. Unfortunately, as I mentioned in the answer to the earlier question, the Google policy change, if it goes into effect at June 1, is a reasonably significant headwind to us. $42 million is kind of our estimate for the year for the 7 months of impact. And that's, what, about 1.5 points of margin. 
So it's basically eating up, and maybe even a little more, all the good work we're doing on spend discipline and basically eating away at that. So as I look at it, net-net for the year, including everything that we see right now, including Hyperconnect, of course, including the effect of the Google change, if it comes to pass, and everything else that's in the mix, my estimate would be that the company for the year probably achieves margins somewhere right in that mid-30s percent range, of course, including that 2-plus percent effect of Hyperconnect. 
It will depend a little bit on what levels of marketing spend we choose to put out there, given the pace of the COVID recovery. So that's probably the swing factor. And of course, generally, the advertising market, because right now, the market remains fairly expensive. And so that's leading to some of our discipline. But depending on kind of overall macroeconomic conditions, that market may adjust as the year goes on. 
So we'll have to see how that all plays out, but marketing spend will be a significant factor in our margins. But I think we feel good about how we've been disciplined so far and remain very much on track with what we expect to deliver."

As I said, the -- our total addressable market ex China, as measured by connected singles ages 18 to 65, is now over 700 million. And the vast -- in the Western markets, only half of this market has ever t",648,"Okay. That was a long question. First, about MAU. As I said, the -- our total addressable market ex China, as measured by connected singles ages 18 to 65, is now over 700 million. And the vast -- in the Western markets, only half of this market has ever tried a dating product. And obviously, that number is much lower in the rest of the world. 
So that's sort of one opportunity. And usually, the cadence of nonusers breaking into the category is steady and slow, driven by new products and features, new marketing campaigns, new channels and, of course, word-of-mouth marketing from other successful users. 
So what became clear during COVID is the importance and efficacy of dating apps for single people, as it became really one of the few choices left for -- to meet people. So now -- for now, it is a matter of us convincing the nonusers around the world to break and adopt a dating app. And we know that once they break into the category, they use multiple of them, and they keep coming back as their life circumstances change. 
One of the examples of trying to tap into some of this category resistor, for example, is our recent new bet, Stir, which taps into that unique value proposition for the single parent segment who find it very hard to navigate mass market products and all of the things they have to go through versus self-selecting into a pool where everybody is sort of dealing with the same issues. 
While on the topic of MAU, I do want to explain something about the relevance of MAU or not in our business. Because we are an episodic churn business and, unlike in an ad-supported business, for us, all MAU does not have the same value in our ecosystem. Both for user outcomes as well as monetization, it is more correlated to the balance of liquidity by gender, age, intent, location, et cetera. 
And so the -- this is why -- and one of the big things is, as people -- they try it once, they have success or they take a break, and they come back when the circumstances change, so even a 25-year-old brand like Match continues to have a very healthy set of reactivations through the years, right? So that's a sort of phenomenon that's unique to our category, I think. 
And to your question about monetization. So on an average, the portfolio payer penetration is around mid-teens. But our hard paywall businesses are as high as 40%. And there's also a very large variance by geography. Even for soft paywall businesses in some markets, they are well north of 25%, close to 30%. 
And so there's a fair degree of runway for us to keep innovating on the payer penetration front. As for average revenue per payer, here's the thing that we have to keep in mind. The total lifetime value amount that a payer pays us is way cheaper than a cost of a single date. And for people who find success on it, this is a priceless, incredibly valuable service. 
And so I do think there is a tremendous amount of innovation opportunity for us to try different things here and increase that RPP. One of the things I'm excited about is we've referred to the virtual goods trading platform on Tinder and this idea of collectibles. So I think -- and Bernard has particular experience with some of those mechanics. I think that will be a pretty interesting vector for us to watch out for. 
So as I look back at the history, we've been able to improve all 3 of these metrics: TAM penetration, payer penetration, revenue per payer pretty much every year. And we still have a pretty long runway ahead and a large market opportunity of users to convince to use our products."

At the time of our separation, we set some clear leverage targets, and we eliminated the buyback that we had back then to ensure that we hit those targets by the end of 2021. We set a net leverage target of 3x. And so now that we've hit that and actually are below that level of net leverage, it clearly makes sense for us to once again have a buyback authorization. 
At that time, we also stated our capital allocation priorities, which really haven't changed. They are to invest, number one, in our business organically. And number two, to do opportunistic M&A to fill any gaps in our portfolio or to add technologies that we think would enhance the overall portfolio. And we've done those kinds of acquisitions successfully on a number of occasions. 
If we can't find those kinds of strategically compelling M&A opportunities, then we want to return capital back to shareholders. And so the buyback provides us with the mechanism to have the ability to return capital back to shareholders if that makes sense. And so we think it's a good tool for us to have, an appropriate tool for us to have to use to offset dilution from employee equity awards and to take advantage of opportunities to buy our stock back cheaply in periods of market dislocation, as you point out, which is what we're experiencing right now. 
And so I think it's fair to assume that as we kind of see what's happening with the stock and with the buyback authorization in place, we'll find opportunities to go in and buy back some shares. And so we'll disclose what we do as we proceed along on that basis. But I think you are thinking about this the same way we are."

Yes. I mean, I think you're thinking about it correctly. We're basically spending where we think it makes sense to spend, given the kind of post-COVID recovery dynamics, and also making sure that we spend where we can hit our ROI hurdles and maintaining that discipline tightly as we always do. 
So if you look at Japan as a good example, we are holding back marketing spend in Japan because the market was not receptive. With all the restrictions, it didn't make sense to turn the spigot on significantly in Japan. 
But now, by contrast, that we're seeing some real recovery there, we've been spending more and running some new creative campaigns on both our Pairs brand and the Tinder brand, as we mentioned and highlight in the letter. 
The other thing that's going on is that the market, in terms of marketing spend, is pretty frothy at the moment. If you look at the U.S., we think the market is expensive. It slowed down significantly at the beginning of COVID, and that was a real opportunity for us to spend aggressively. And we did, but the market has really become much more expensive since that initial COVID-led downturn. 
And so it's become harder for us to hit our ROI thresholds, particularly at our marketing-heavy spend businesses like Match and Meetic, where we really maintain that ROI discipline. So if we're not seeing opportunities there to hit our hurdles on marketing spend, we're not putting the spend out there. 
And I think between IDFA, which had some impact and then the environment being strong just more generally, it's just become very challenging to hit the hurdles. The thing to watch out for, I think, though, is what happens with the overall economic picture. 
If people start to get more nervous about where the economy is headed, and we start to see other marketers' advertising budgets get cut back or get delayed, which we often see, and I think we're starting to even see a few signals of that, that could present us with opportunities to again hit our hurdles and spend more aggressively. And so as I mentioned in the answer to Brent, that will be a swing factor as we go through the year from a margin perspective. 
So I think we're starting to see a few signs of nervousness in the market, which could be a benefit to us because, as Shar said, our business tends to be economically resilient, somewhat recession-proof. And so if we start to see more opportunities to spend in the market, more opportunity to hit our hurdles, we will absolutely be nimble and take advantage of that, just like we were at the beginning of the COVID period."

This is my first earnings call as Match Group's CEO, and I want to start off by thanking everyone at the company for such a warm welcome. I truly believe that love, connections and relationships are the pillars to a happy and fulfilling life. I'm elated to work with the team that's responsible for creating joy through connecting millions of people around the world. I've been on the job for 2 months, and I've been fortunate enough to travel to many of our global offices with Gary and the rest of the management team. 
At each stop, I've conducted all hands, asked-me-anything meetings, to convey what I will bring to the table and what I expect from the team in return. As I told my colleagues, I'm passionate about people, culture and product. I promised the teams that I will always be authentic, honest and act with integrity. And I expect our employees to bring those same values to work every day. I've been learning as much as possible about our business, assessing what's working and what's not and beginning to build our strategy. I'm very impressed by the team's experience and their growth mindset as well as strong financial discipline. This balance will serve us well as we forge ahead. 
I also want to thank Gary, who's been a great partner during my onboarding. As COO and CFO, he's made key strategic recommendations that we see eye to eye on, and we've been able to move quickly and decisively to unlock value across the portfolio and set up the next phase of growth. There's no doubt that there are challenging macroeconomic factors at play. Over the past 2.5 years, people have been forced to isolate, then adjust to society reopening. And I don't believe the behavioral impacts of COVID are fully understood yet. But what I do know is that human, real-world connections are imperative. And our apps are the best way to create those connections. It's our responsibility to innovate and provide the best experiences, and that creates the real opportunity for our business. 
In our shareholder letter, I was able to share my initial observations about the business, market opportunity and our portfolio of products. I also touched upon my management style, noting that we have to be decisive and set up the right teams with long-term growth in mind. In 2 months, we've made immediate steps to unlock and maximize Tinder's true long-term potential. 
Tinder is the go-to app in the industry, available in 190 countries in over 40 languages. It is a global phenomenon that has transformed dating culture in Western markets over the past 10 years, and it's still early in its journey in non-Western markets. I believe that innovating Tinder will only enhance its ability to continue to transform the dating experience for the next generation of singles around the world. 
With the current Tinder CEO stepping down, I've put a new leadership team in place who will report directly to me, while I lead the recruiting efforts for a new CEO. This team has a great working dynamic that's already apparent and brings proven expertise to Tinder's next phase of growth. They're passionate, strategic leaders who are also able to get into the trenches, experiment, lead by example and get things done. I'm confident that this new team will work well together to build product and enhancements and innovation. 
But I do want to acknowledge that there have been some misfires and turnover on the team that have led to delays in product and execution in the first half of the year. I believe that our new team can right that ship, but it will take some time to execute and build momentum. 
I've been impressed by the diversified dating experiences throughout the portfolio. As part of Match Group, Hinge has been a breakout star. The team has executed on building a strong brand, including their Designed to be Deleted campaign that resonates with our user base. They have elegant, differentiated product that I believe will be just as successful in international markets as they have been in English speaking ones. 
While our other brands continue to face their own challenges, I'm working closely with the teams to ensure that we're organized to tackle them and set up the brands for long-term success. 
While the Hyperconnect acquisition has not gone to plan in our first year, we finalized the acquisition during lockdowns. My trip to Korea last month was the first time the teams were able to sit down together since we completed the deal. Their core products have struggled with increased competition and adjusting to the elimination of IDFA. But the team is strong, and I've been impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation. 
The Hyperconnect team has built technologies that have been introduced in our products around the world. This collaboration is something that I expect to see more of across our teams. 
We continue to increase adoption and acceptance of our products in markets like Japan. We have a team on the ground ensuring our 2 products, Tinder and Pairs, have marketing messages that are resonating with our users. 
In our other established brands, we are ensuring rightsizing marketing spend to ensure long-term profitability. And when we think about new opportunities and demographics to serve, we found a great business in the league. Their founder and CEO, Amanda Bradford, has built a brand that people love and continue to return to. We've been impressed by the league's user base as they are willing to pay significant premiums for this service. 
From my experience, product innovation always drives user adoption and engagement. We have great products. But I want to speed up product delivery, bring new dynamic features to life and set big audacious goals. At Tinder, we need some time to regain product momentum. I'm committed to product innovation that will give our users more reasons to come back more often and for new singles to sign up and start dating. 
This is only my 63rd day on the job. But over the next few months, I'll be building out more plans as Gary and I continue to work with the teams. And on future calls, I will share more details about our developing strategy. The team's understanding and execution on building subscription models is unparalleled. I bring expertise on the a la carte side of the business, which will be a great complement to our products. We will push our teams to innovate, collaborate and drive more growth on our platforms in the future. 
I bet on people and feel great about the team's ability to transform the way people connect with others around the world. Together, I expect we will drive long-term shareholder value, be decisive and always strive to win. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."

I'm excited for my and BK's first call together. There is a lot to cover this quarter, so I'm going to get right into it. We had a solid Q2 with total revenue of $795 million, up 12% year-over-year. The Q2 FX headwinds w",2030,"Thanks, BK, and hello, everyone. I'm excited for my and BK's first call together. There is a lot to cover this quarter, so I'm going to get right into it. 
We had a solid Q2 with total revenue of $795 million, up 12% year-over-year. The Q2 FX headwinds were severe, as our revenue would have been $842 million, up 19% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact in Q2 was $13 million worse than what we expected when we provided our Q2 outlook on our May earnings call. 
Our direct revenue grew 12% year-over-year. It grew 9% year-over-year in the Americas, with strength at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa, coupled with declines at the established brands. It grew 6% year-over-year in Europe but 19% on an FX-neutral basis. 
Europe continues to be impacted by the war in Ukraine as well. Direct revenue grew 32% in APAC and other, 49% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by Hyperconnect. Total payers were 16.4 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter. Payers were up 4% year-over-year in the Americas, 5% in Europe and 32% in APAC and other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Tinder payer additions came in stronger than we had expected, while our established brands, including Match and Match Affinity brands, Meetic, OkCupid and PlentyOfFish, saw year-over-year payer declines of over 10% in aggregate. 
RPP was up 3% year-over-year to $15.86 in Q2. RPP was up 5% in the Americas, reflecting higher average rates for subscriptions and increased average a la carte purchases at Tinder and Hinge. RPP was up 1% in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were partially offset by the strength of the dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was flat in APAC and other, where contributions from Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide and 13% in both Europe and APAC and other. 
Tinder performed well in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $449 million, up 13% year-over-year, 20% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 14% year-over-year, adding 1.3 million payers to 10.9 million, and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX. Tinder RPP was up 5% on an FX-neutral basis. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 12% year-over-year in Q2, driven by 10% RPP growth and 2% payers growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continued to drive the growth. 
Some of the pressure on our established brands, payers and direct revenue in the quarter was attributable to difficulties finding marketing opportunities that met our ROI thresholds. There were a couple of other specific trends as well. At PlentyOfFish, which tends to serve a lower income demographic, users had benefited from COVID-related government stimulus in Q2 '21, but we saw weaker payer in RPP trends in Q2 2022 as the benefits of the stimulus abated. 
The Match brands has some lingering impacts from its new business model, and Meetic saw some conversion softness. 
In Asia, Hyperconnect contributed as we expected in Q2, but its revenue was heavily impacted by FX, especially against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen, as well as by typical Ramadan-related seasonality. Pairs in Japan saw a burst of new user strength after COVID restrictions were lifted, but only a modest sustained improvement in revenue and other trends in Q2. 
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year, as we continue to see strong demand for ads in our products and rates increased year-over-year. We had a $10 million operating loss in Q2 as the intangibles primarily related to the Azar and Hakuna trade names were impaired by $217 million or roughly half the intangibles that were attributed to them at the time of the acquisition. The impairment stems from a lower financial outlook for the 2 apps, including FX impacts in certain of Hyperconnect's key markets as well as the use of higher discount rates in the DCF calculations given rising interest rates generally. 
Adjusted operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $286 million, representing a margin of 36%. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 62% year-over-year in Q2, but were only up 9%, excluding Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 14% year-over-year, primarily due to higher app store fees, including the initial $5 million amount placed into escrow related to the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 29% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $13 million or 10% year-over-year, the second straight quarter where we saw a year-over-year reduction, as we continue to reduce marketing spend in our more established brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Sales and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 15%. For the first half of the year, sales and marketing spend ex Hyperconnect declined $21 million year-over-year. 
G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose $3 million or 3% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, unchanged from the prior year. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees and an increase in travel expenses as we continued to return to a more normal cadence of business travel. 
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 51% year-over-year and were 10% of revenue, as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge, in a highly competitive labor market. Our gross leverage declined to 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3x at the end of Q2. These leverage levels reflect the payment of $441 million related to the settlement of the former Tinder employee lawsuits and arbitrations. Those matters are now resolved. 
We ended the quarter with $473 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed approximately $216 million in Q2 to buy back approximately 3 million of our shares at a VWAP of just over $73 per share on a trade date basis. We currently have approximately 9.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization. 
As we stated in the letter, there are a number of key factors affecting our performance and outlook. The first is FX, which significantly affected the first half of the year and we expect will impact the second half of the year as well. We used the forward curve to provide our outlook. And the curve has consistently underestimated the dollar strength this year, which is largely why we have been behind our outlooks for Q1 and Q2. 
Leaving aside FX impacts, it's become clearer that COVID created some unusual trends in our business. The established brands benefited from a less competitive marketing environment in the early days of COVID, which drove incremental growth. And their users also benefited from savings and government stimulus payments, [indiscernible] monetization. As these factors have abated, these businesses once again face growth challenges. 
Tinder experienced a very strong second half of 2021 as people began to socialize more after being vaccinated. Additionally, Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now lapping these challenging comps. Moreover, some of the Tinder product initiatives and optimizations that we've been counting on for revenue growth in the second half of 2022 are not delivering as we'd expected and were delaying some launches. 
Our PlentyofFish live stream business is showing a slowdown in revenue growth after a period of strength, in part driven by stimulus-induced spending. And we haven't seen a sustained rebound in performance in Japan, where [ gayers ] remain reluctant and COVID cases continue to rise. Taken together, these factors lead us to expect relatively muted revenue growth for the second half of 2022. 
On the cost side, we're feeling the financial impacts of the tight labor market, which caused us to raise compensation levels as well as a marketing environment, which is not yet fully adjusted to the economic realities. As such, we've significantly slowed our hiring and are sticking to our ROI discipline in our marketing spend, even at the expense of some revenue growth. 
The App Store fees also continue to be a headwind. App Store fees, including the escrow amount related to the Google Play store, were 19.5% of our revenues in Q2 '22, up over 2 points from Q1 2020. We remain optimistic that the app stores will be required to adjust their policies as the DMA in Europe goes into effect in 2023, and we prevail in our lawsuit against Google in the U.S., which should create a much fairer app ecosystem for all. 
For Q3, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, essentially flat year-over-year. We anticipate over $60 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q3, meaning that total revenue growth would be over 8 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Tinder's direct revenue to be up mid-single digits, low teens on an FX-neutral basis in Q3, while all other brands' direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the established brands. 
We expect adjusted operating income of $255 million to $260 million in Q3, representing margins of about 32% at the midpoint of the ranges. We expect lower year-over-year sales and marketing spend, a much lower year-over-year growth rate in product and development than in Q2 2022 and a continued increase in app store fees. The lower-than-expected revenue contribution from Tinder, which is our highest margin business, has a meaningful negative effect on our overall company margins. 
For the full year, we're now estimating $195 million of year-over-year FX impacts, which is $72 million more than in our last earnings call and $163 million more than when we first gave our thoughts about 2022 back in November of '21. We estimate FX is causing a 6-point reduction in year-over-year revenue growth for full year 2022, 2 points worse than at the time of our last earnings call. 
For Q4, we expect limited improvement in our year-over-year top line growth rate and modest improvement in AOI margins compared to Q3. While we expect the second half of the year to be below our growth targets, we believe the company remains positioned to deliver accelerating revenue growth as we move through 2023, driven by improved product execution at Tinder. The biggest unknown we face relates to the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business. 
The consumer is facing significant pressure from rising gas and food prices, constraining purchasing power. Our product is a small purchase and one that leads to happiness. So consumers are low to stop or reduce it. If the economy continues to worsen, we expect our business to remain resilient, but we may see modest effects at some of our brands, particularly those that cater to lowering consumers. 
We believe subscriptions, which constitute the vast majority of our revenue, will remain sticky, but it's possible consumers will pull back modestly on a la carte purchases, which tend to be more discretionary. We expect our Hinge business to remain largely immune from overall consumer spending pullbacks given its more affluent user base and have seen no impact to date. We'll continue to monitor these trends and provide an update on our next earnings call. 
Our category provides ample runway for growth, which we can achieve by growing users and by increasing payer penetration and RPP. It is up to us to execute on the opportunities. The recent changes we've made at Tinder should better position us to perform the way we have historically. While the business is facing some temporary challenges, we will remain disciplined on costs, especially in marketing and hiring. Our longer-term prospects remain bright. And our goal remains to deliver strong, consistent growth and profitability for our shareholders. We believe our combination of growth and profitability as well as our free cash flow generation is one that few other companies can achieve. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But with Renata's departure, I wanted to act quickly and be decisive and put in a team that I felt confident in. 
We've assembled a team of all stars from Tinder and Match Group, and we also brought in Mark as CPO, who I've known for over 15 years. Faye is moving into a newly formed position as COO of Tinder and will improve execution across the entire organization. Tom has done a great job leading engineering for the last 5 years at Tinder. And we're delighted that he's going to continue to lead our engineering teams. Melissa is an award-winning CMO, who's done great things at OkCupid, and we're really happy that she is bringing her expertise to our biggest business. And Mark joined Tinder 1 week after I joined Match Group, and he's my top choice to lead product as I've worked with him at Electronic Arts and have admired his accomplishments leading product teams. This team in place is already working really well together and driving the business forward. And we think the new CEO, once in place, is going to really enjoy working with this strong team. 
When it comes to finding the new CEO, first and foremost, I want to break the cycle of short-tenured leaders at Tinder. I want someone who's experienced, creative leader that inspires and motivates team, but is also aligned with our growth vision for the business. I will be personally leading this search. But in the meantime, I'm really excited to immerse myself in Los Angeles with the Tinder team. With leadership change comes tremendous opportunity, and I really look forward to taking his team and Tinder to the next level of growth."

There's a gap there, and it really results from 3 areas. 
The first, which is about 1/3 of the gap, is from additional FX headwinds. We talked a lot in the prepared remarks about how much that has gotten more severe. And so about 1/3 of the gap comes from that. Of the rest, about half of the rest or 1/3 of the total comes from what BK just talked about, which is Tinder missed execution and the lack of delivery of initiatives, not having hit product road map and delivered as we expected in the first half of the year. And the other piece comes from a variety of other factors across the business: weakness in APAC, especially Japan; weakness in live streaming and to the established brands; and generally, some effects of macro weakness, we think, might be in that bucket as well. So those are the 3 buckets which, of the total gap, I think you should account for about 1/3. 
And now while we're not expecting much improvement in Q4 compared to Q3, we do expect momentum to build after that and to carry over and improve as we move through 2023."

One, there's still ample runway on monetization and user growth in core markets as we continue to roll out features and marketing campaigns to drive this growth. For example, we're really excited about the next monetization feature, which is a premium subscription tier. 
Second is capitalizing on product market fit that Hinge has created and translating that into as many markets as fast as we can.

I want to point out a couple of things as it relates to Hinge and margins. The first thing is, while we are being very judicious and cautious about marketing spend across the company as well as on hiring now and going forward, we recognize that Hinge is the brightest spot in the portfolio. And it is our strongest growth business. It's a very important business to us. And we are going to continue to invest at the right levels in that business, both on the marketing side as well as in product and development and people. So we're being judicious, but we're being thoughtful. And we want to make sure Hinge has the resources it needs to continue on a growth trajectory. And I don't see issues there in terms of the way we are treating expenses as it relates to marketing or headcount. I think Hinge has the resources to continue to grow exactly as we're planning for it to grow. So I want to make sure people understand the nuances there and the distinctions between businesses that are struggling more to grow, where we're going to be more judicious on marketing and hiring, versus a business like Hinge, which is growing strongly and we're investing in. 
As far as what kind of margins we can achieve, I think that we are still very smart and efficient with our marketing spend. We are spending where we see traction in the business. Like now in a market like Germany, we see the organic traction. We're investing into it with marketing spend. That has been our playbook and continues to be our playbook at Hinge. And we think that Hinge is already in position to achieve margins that are close to the company levels of margin. And we think that, that's what Hinge can achieve over time. And so we don't think Hinge will be a drag on our margins. We think that Hinge will contribute nicely to the overall company margins and still grow at the levels that we've been talking about as we've been providing our outlook, which, as we say, is 50% for this year, and we think will be very strong into 2023 as well. So hopefully, that answers your questions."

And as I talked about a little bit with the answer to John's question as well about 2023, so I'll try to weave that together. First of all, I want to say off the bat, we remain confident that this business can return to mid- to high-teens revenue growth. There's a lot of opportunity for us, and it really comes down to execution. And right now, we didn't execute as we needed to and as we expected to in the first part of the year. So we need a few quarters to rebuild the momentum in the business. And as BK has talked about extensively, in particular, we need a few quarters to get the Tinder team to improve their overall execution and deliver on their product road map. 
And so as you know, as that takes place, we need to build back into stronger and stronger growth. And I think that will happen as we move into and then through 2023 at a measured pace in terms of improving the growth. Obviously, our goal is to deliver more than that, but our goal is to at least deliver strong and improving growth as we move through the quarter, starting in 2023. 
We will provide more details and specifics on what I think we can deliver for 2023 in the upcoming calls, as is our custom. So we'll give you a better sense of what exactly the cadence is going to be like and what levels we think we can get to. But our goal is to get back to where we have been. We think there's opportunity to do that. And as long as we execute, and in particular, the Tinder team executes on that, we do think we will get there."

I can take that one. Lauren, thanks for the great questions. I feel confident that coins and virtual goods are a compelling offering in Tinder and can lead to significant monetization of powered users, who I believe are currently under monetized. Mark and I have spent most of our career in gaming, focusing on building such ecosystems, and we bring this expertise to the table. I love the idea of virtual goods and currency in Tinder, but I believe it hasn't been approached in a completely logical way. 
For instance, my experience in gaming, demand for virtual goods and collectibles are rolled out first, and then you launch the currency to get these items later. While it's frustrating to pause the efforts, I think it's super important that Mark and I deliver the right value proposition, so this can be a long-term revenue stream. 
In terms of your question around shorter-term subscription packages, historically, Match Group has not offered these. But we are going to start testing a variety of short-term subscriptions at different price points to see what works. We plan our initial rollout of these programs this upcoming fall."

The",405,"And then maybe I can just jump in on the second half outlook. I want to clarify something that you said, which is that implies we are counting on coins or even virtual goods for the second half delivery of our revenue targets. And that isn't the case. There wasn't much, if anything, baked into the second half outlook around coins and virtual goods. So the fact that we're delaying that is not the driver of the shortfall versus our expectations for the second half. But there were a series of other less keynote kind of initiatives and optimizations that were expected in the first half of 2022 to help us deliver the second half revenue and also more initiatives in the back half of the year to help deliver the second half revenue. And it's on that series of initiatives, kind of less sexy, less notable initiatives but still very important initiatives, that really has not taken place. And it explains why changes in the team at Tinder have been made to try to make sure that we deliver more fully on the initiatives and optimizations that we have in our plans. And so it's that kind of shortfall and delay that's really causing the issue. 
I think if you look back where we were in May, we still believe that we were going to deliver those initiatives. And right now, I think our confidence in that happening in the back half of the year has come down. We've made the changes, and we think we'll be positioned to have more momentum as we get out of 2022 and into 2023. 
And if you look back into last year, you'll note that we had a very strong performance in Q3 and Q4, as I called out. And the reason for that is we did deliver on significant initiatives, not particularly massive initiatives, but a series of important initiatives and optimizations in the early part of the year as well as in Q3, and I talked about it in the remarks. And that really propelled strong payer additions in Q3 and into Q4 and strong revenue growth. That materialized in 2021, and it hasn't materialized in 2022. And we need to deliver on those kinds of initiatives and product improvements to drive the revenue growth. And the team at Tinder needs to do that, and we think we'll now be positioned to do that again."

And we expect our business would be minimally impacted in a downturn as well. I think as you rightly point out, if there were any impact, it would be at the brands that serve lower-income consumers with less discretionary income. We wouldn't expect to see, for example, effect at our business like Hinge, which tends to have a much more affluent customer. And so far, at Hinge, we definitely have not seen any impact from the overall macroeconomic environment. 
We also think that the subscription nature of our business does -- is more sticky and does provide us with some insulation from an economic downturn. But on the other hand, there is some a la carte revenue, and that's more discretionary and probably would be at more risk in a downturn. 
So while right now, we don't see any real impacts to our business for macroeconomic factors, we are watching for them closely. It's something we want to monitor as we get out of the year, because we do think there are a lot of cross wins going on globally. But I would say that I don't see much downside to our 2022, even if things did continue to deteriorate. I think we've kind of assumed the right level of potential risk there as well in our 2022 outlook. So we'll see what materializes in the next 6 months. But I think that your view of kind of the resiliency of our business, the way that affluent consumers, in particular, are more insulated, the risk more on the people with lower income, more discretionary spending, I think, is the right way to think about our business."

So -- and there's even a greater opportunity in APAC and the rest of the world. We have demonstrated that product innovation leads to product adoption, which drives overall category growth. It's important to continue to innovate on our products in order to introduce online dating to new users. 
A great example is at Hinge. It has great user momentum and a strong top-of-funnel growth, directly driven by exciting new features such as voice props. Tinder has not seen that same level of product innovation recently. But we feel like we have the right marketing and product teams in place now to innovate and drive its next level of growth."

Let me just make sure that everyone understands kind of our outlook, and there's clarity around that. So we're basically saying, at the midpoint of the ranges in Q3, there'll be about 32% AOI margins. And then we're expecting some modest improvement from there, which I think you could read as 100 to 150 basis points of sequential improvement in Q4. 
In terms of the overall year-over-year change in the margin drivers, let me see if I can kind of do this off the top of my head. And so I would say app store fees are probably 1.5 points of headwinds. So there's still a meaningful headwind on year-over-year margins in Q3, and probably headcount is maybe 2.5 points of headwind. So you have 4 points of headwind from the app stores and the headcount moves that we've made. You probably get about a point of benefit from sales and marketing on the other hand. And I would say there's probably some small other effects from other items, and that's probably a little bit of a headwind. So I probably am around 3.5 or so of year-over-year decline. So that probably rounds to your 4%. But I think it's primarily the headcount and the app store fees with some offset from the lower marketing spend. 
In terms of your second question, I don't expect there to be significant leverage on the product development line in the upcoming quarters. But I do think that as we turn the corner into 2023, we'll start to see the effects of the pullbacks in hiring that we're making. And also, we'll start to see stronger revenue growth, stronger revenue generation from Tinder, in particular, as the new team really starts to accelerate and build momentum. And that will help drive momentum on the product development side, as well as should help overall company margins because, as I mentioned in my remarks, the fact that Tinder, which is a very high-margin business, is not contributing as it has been does have a significant effect on the overall company margin. So getting Tinder going is important not only from a revenue growth perspective, but also from a margin improvement, margin acceleration perspective. So it is the key. It's the reason we've made the changes we are driving to. And I think we have optimism as we turn the corner into 2023 on all those aspects of the business."

Let me take the second one first because I have a tendency to forget them if I don't do it that way. In Japan, I think the thing that's important to understand is that they really put a lot of restrictions into place in that market, 5 states of emergency over a period of a year or so. And you have a conservative culture, I think, still kind of a reluctant dating culture still getting used to dating apps. And I think that has frozen their behavior to a large extent. And so while we did see some initial improvement once the restrictions were lifted, that was probably people who had pent-up demand, who were kind of eager and wanted to get out there and were waiting for the restrictions to lift. So you saw a little bit of a bump, a little bit of improvement out of the gate, but then there was no follow-on from that. 
And that is kind of the case [ til ] today. And unfortunately, in that market, you also have COVID rising again, which has only made people, again, more conservative in their behavior. So I think it's going to take a few quarters more to normalize in Japan. I think all the macro trends that have always made that a good market for us, a low marriage rate, hard to find your partner in that market, I think, are all still there. But some of this needs to normalize. And I think, as BK said in his remarks, we haven't quite seen a full return to normal behavior. And I don't think we have a full understanding in every market of kind of the impact of COVID on people's behavior. So Japan, I think, is a really important case study. And given how severely they took their response to COVID, it's going to take some time for it to bounce back. And I think that's what we're expecting in our outlook. And I think that's the right way to look at it based on everything we see now. 
Obviously, we're hoping it bounce back faster. We will do everything we can to try to make that happen. But I think that, that is what we're dealing with in the Japan market. 
In terms of kind of buybacks and M&A, I want to point out, in dating, in particular, we think we've done a lot of good acquisitions. If you look at Hinge in particular, it's a home-run acquisition, just a phenomenal acquisition, and there's much more we can do with that business. 
And if you go prior to Hinge, you look at the PlentyOfFish acquisition, you look at the Pairs acquisition in Japan, despite the recent trends in that market, those have been very, very strong acquisitions for us as well. And we're very optimistic about The League, which is the most recent acquisition we've made in the dating space. 
So if we're able to find more compelling targets in the dating space, we absolutely would like to continue to act on them, and we won't hesitate to do so. We have the financial flexibility to do them. So there's no issues there. 
By contrast, when you look at the acquisition that we made outside of dating, it hasn't gone the way we would have hoped. We are working on it. We think the team is still fantastic. There's more we can do with that business. But there's no denying that, that acquisition of Hyperconnect has not worked out the way we had hoped, at least in the first year. And so the bar has been raised around nondating acquisitions. That's not to say that we wouldn't do them. But we need to be more convinced in both the growth that can be derived from those kinds of acquisitions as well as the profitability levels. And we need to see a clear path to profitability, if not immediate profitability. So I think the standards will be higher for an acquisition outside of dating. 
So that's kind of how we think about our overall acquisition strategy, and it's something that BK and I have spent time chatting about. And we will continue to refine our thinking around kind of M&A, because it is a core element of our toolbox and something that we have been good at. 
All that being said, right now, the way we look at it, we generate a lot of excess capital, probably $1 billion or so a year, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less, but that's a good number to think about. And so we need to figure out what to do with that capital and use it in the most effective way. And right now, given the market dislocation and where our stock price is, betting on ourselves is our best bet. It's our highest returning bet that we can make, and we're going to continue to do that aggressively with our excess capital. And we'll always be dynamic in this. This is a fluid set of decisions, M&A, buyback shares, whatever makes sense. We constantly discuss this internally with our Board, and we want to maintain that flexibility. But in the environment that we're operating in at the moment, we think that betting on ourselves is absolutely the right thing to do. We did it in the second quarter, and we expect to continue to do that in the third quarter as well. So hopefully, that answers your 2 questions. I know we're getting a little bit close to time. So why don't I turn it over to BK for a couple of closing remarks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. This is my first earnings call as Match Group's CEO, and I want to start off by thanking everyone at the company for such a warm welcome. I truly believe that love, connections and relationships are the pillars to a happy and fulfilling life. I'm elated to work with the team that's responsible for creating joy through connecting millions of people around the world. I've been on the job for 2 months, and I've been fortunate enough to travel to many of our global offices with Gary and the rest of the management team.
At each stop, I've conducted all hands, ask-me-anything meetings, to convey what I will bring to the table and what I expect from the team in return. As I told my colleagues, I'm passionate about people, culture and product. I promised the teams that I will always be authentic, honest and act with integrity. And I expect our employees to bring those same values to work every day.
I've been learning as much as possible about our business, assessing what's working and what's not and beginning to build our strategy. I'm very impressed by the team's experience and their growth mindset as well as strong financial discipline. This balance will serve us well as we forge ahead.
I also want to thank Gary, who's been a great partner during my onboarding. As COO and CFO, he's made key strategic recommendations that we see eye to eye on, and we've been able to move quickly and decisively to unlock value across the portfolio and set up the next phase of growth.
There's no doubt that there are challenging macroeconomic factors at play. Over the past 2.5 years, people have been forced to isolate, then adjust to society reopening and I don't believe the behavioral impacts of COVID are fully understood yet. But what I do know is that human, real-world connections are imperative. And our apps are the best way to create those connections. It's our responsibility to innovate and provide the best experiences, and that creates the real opportunity for our business.
In our shareholder letter, I was able to share my initial observations about the business, market opportunity and our portfolio of products. I also touched upon my management style, noting that we have to be decisive and set up the right teams with long-term growth in mind. In 2 months, we've made immediate steps to unlock and maximize Tinder's true long-term potential.
Tinder is the go-to app in the industry, available in 190 countries in over 40 languages. It is a global phenomenon that has transformed dating culture in Western markets over the past 10 years, and it's still early in its journey in non-Western markets. I believe that innovating Tinder will only enhance its ability to continue to transform the dating experience for the next generation of singles around the world.
With the current Tinder CEO stepping down, I've put a new leadership team in place who will report directly to me, while I lead the recruiting efforts for a new CEO. This team has a great working dynamic that's already apparent and brings proven expertise to Tinder's next phase of growth. They're passionate, strategic leaders who are also able to get into the trenches, experiment, lead by example and get things done. I'm confident that this new team will work well together to build product and enhancements and innovation.
But I do want to acknowledge that there have been some misfires and turnover on the team that have led to delays in product and execution in the first half of the year. I believe that our new team can right that ship, but it will take some time to execute and build momentum.
I've been impressed by the diversified dating experiences throughout the portfolio. As part of Match Group, Hinge has been a breakout star. The team has executed on building a strong brand, including their Designed to be Deleted campaign that resonates with our user base. They have elegant, differentiated product that I believe will be just as successful in international markets as they have been in English speaking ones.
While our other brands continue to face their own challenges, I'm working closely with the teams to ensure that we're organized to tackle them and set up the brands for long-term success. While the Hyperconnect acquisition has not gone to plan in our first year, we finalized the acquisition during lockdowns. My trip to Korea last month was the first time the teams were able to sit down together since we completed the deal. 
Their core products have struggled with increased competition and adjusting to the elimination of IDFA. But the team is strong, and I've been impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation. The Hyperconnect team has built technologies that have been introduced in our products around the world. This collaboration is something that I expect to see more of across our teams.
We continue to increase adoption and acceptance of our products in markets like Japan. We have a team on the ground ensuring our 2 products, Tinder and Pairs, have marketing messages that are resonating with our users.
In our other established brands, we are ensuring rightsizing marketing spend to ensure long-term profitability. And when we think about new opportunities and demographics to serve, we found a great business in The League. Their founder and CEO, Amanda Bradford, has built a brand that people love and continue to return to. We've been impressed by The League's user base as they are willing to pay significant premiums for this service.
From my experience, product innovation always drives user adoption and engagement. We have great products. But I want to speed up product delivery, bring new dynamic features to life and set big audacious goals. At Tinder, we need some time to regain product momentum. I'm committed to product innovation that will give our users more reasons to come back more often and for new singles to sign up and start dating.
This is only my 63rd day on the job. But over the next few months, I'll be building out more plans as Gary and I continue to work with the teams. And on future calls, I will share more details about our developing strategy. The team's understanding and execution on building subscription models is unparalleled. I bring expertise on the a la carte side of the business, which will be a great complement to our products. We will push our teams to innovate, collaborate and drive more growth on our platforms in the future.
I bet on people and feel great about the team's ability to transform the way people connect with others around the world. Together, I expect we will drive long-term shareholder value, be decisive and always strive to win. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."

The Q2 FX headwinds we",2035,"Thanks, BK, and hello, everyone. I'm excited for my and BK's first call together. There is a lot to cover this quarter, so I'm going to get right into it.
We had a solid Q2 with total revenue of $795 million, up 12% year-over-year. The Q2 FX headwinds were severe, as our revenue would have been $842 million, up 19% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact in Q2 was $13 million worse than what we expected when we provided our Q2 outlook on our May earnings call.
Our direct revenue grew 12% year-over-year. It grew 9% year-over-year in the Americas, with strength at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa, coupled with declines at the established brands. It grew 6% year-over-year in Europe but 19% on an FX-neutral basis.
Europe continues to be impacted by the war in Ukraine as well. Direct revenue grew 32% in APAC and other, 49% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by Hyperconnect. Total payers were 16.4 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter. Payers were up 4% year-over-year in the Americas, 5% in Europe and 32% in APAC and other, which was aided by the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Tinder payer additions came in stronger than we had expected, while our established brands, including Match and Match Affinity brands, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish saw year-over-year payer declines of over 10% in aggregate.
RPP was up 3% year-over-year to $15.86 in Q2. RPP was up 5% in the Americas, reflecting higher average rates per subscriptions increased average a la carte purchases at Tinder and Hinge. RPP was up 1% in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were partially offset by the strength of the dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was flat in APAC and other, where contributions from Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide and 13% in both Europe and APAC and other.
Tinder performed well in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $449 million, up 13% year-over-year, 20% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 14% year-over-year, adding 1.3 million payers to 10.9 million, and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX. Tinder RPP was up 5% on an FX-neutral basis.
All other brands grew direct revenue 12% year-over-year in Q2, driven by 10% RPP growth and 2% payers growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continued to drive the growth.
Some of the pressure on our established brands, payers and direct revenue in the quarter was attributable to difficulties finding marketing opportunities that met our ROI thresholds. There were a couple of other specific trends as well. At Plenty of Fish, which tends to serve a lower income demographic, users had benefited from COVID-related government stimulus in Q2 '21, but we saw weaker payer in RPP trends in Q2 2022 as the benefits of the stimulus abated.
The Match brands has some lingering impacts from its new business model, and Meetic saw some conversion softness. In Asia, Hyperconnect contributed as we expected in Q2, but its revenue was heavily impacted by FX, especially against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen, as well as by typical Ramadan-related seasonality. Pairs in Japan saw a burst of new user strength after COVID restrictions were lifted, but only a modest sustained improvement in revenue and other trends in Q2.
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year, as we continue to see strong demand for ads in our products and rates increased year-over-year. We had a $10 million operating loss in Q2 as the intangibles primarily related to the Azar and Hakuna trade names were impaired by $217 million or roughly half the intangibles that were attributed to them at the time of the acquisition. The impairment stems from a lower financial outlook for the 2 apps, including FX impacts in certain of Hyperconnect's key markets as well as the use of higher discount rates in the DCF calculations given rising interest rates generally.
Adjusted operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $286 million, representing a margin of 36%. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 62% year-over-year in Q2, but were only up 9%, excluding Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 14% year-over-year, primarily due to higher app store fees, including the initial $5 million amount placed into escrow related to the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 29% of total revenue.
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, decreased $13 million or 10% year-over-year, the second straight quarter where we saw a year-over-year reduction, as we continue to reduce marketing spend in our more established brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Sales and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 15%. For the first half of the year, sales and marketing spend ex Hyperconnect declined $21 million year-over-year.
G&A expense, excluding Hyperconnect, rose $3 million or 3% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, unchanged from the prior year. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees and an increase in travel expenses as we continue to return to a more normal cadence of business travel.
Product development costs, excluding Hyperconnect, grew 51% year-over-year and were 10% of revenue, as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge, in a highly competitive labor market.
Our gross leverage declined to 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3x at the end of Q2. These leverage levels reflect the payment of $441 million related to the settlement of the former Tinder employee lawsuits and arbitrations. Those matters are now resolved.
We ended the quarter with $473 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed approximately $216 million in Q2 to buy back approximately 3 million of our shares at a VWAP of just over $73 per share on a trade date basis. We currently have approximately 9.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization.
As we stated in the letter, there are a number of key factors affecting our performance and outlook. The first is FX, which significantly affected the first half of the year and we expect will impact the second half of the year as well. We used the forward curve to provide our outlook. And the curve has consistently underestimated the dollar strength this year, which is largely why we have been behind our outlooks for Q1 and Q2.
Leaving aside FX impacts, it's become clearer that COVID created some unusual trends in our business. The established brands benefited from a less competitive marketing environment in the early days of COVID, which drove incremental growth. And their users also benefited from savings and government stimulus payments, which buttressed monetization. As these factors have abated, these businesses once again face growth challenges.
Tinder experienced a very strong second half of 2021 as people began to socialize more after being vaccinated. Additionally, Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now lapping these challenging comps. Moreover, some of the Tinder product initiatives and optimizations that we've been counting on for revenue growth in the second half of 2022 are not delivering as we'd expected and were delaying some launches.
Our Plenty of Fish live stream business is showing a slowdown in revenue growth after a period of strength, in part driven by stimulus-induced spending. And we haven't seen a sustained rebound in performance in Japan, where gamers remain reluctant and COVID cases continue to rise. Taken together, these factors lead us to expect relatively muted revenue growth for the second half of 2022.
On the cost side, we're feeling the financial impacts of the tight labor market, which caused us to raise compensation levels as well as a marketing environment, which is not yet fully adjusted to the economic realities. As such, we've significantly slowed our hiring and are sticking to our ROI discipline in our marketing spend, even at the expense of some revenue growth.
The App Store fees also continue to be a headwind. App Store fees, including the escrow amount related to the Google Play Store, were 19.5% of our revenues in Q2 '22, up over 2 points from Q1 2020. We remain optimistic that the app stores will be required to adjust their policies as the DMA in Europe goes into effect in 2023, and we prevail in our lawsuit against Google in the U.S., which should create a much fairer app ecosystem for all.
For Q3, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, essentially flat year-over-year. We anticipate over $60 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q3, meaning that total revenue growth would be over 8 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Tinder's direct revenue to be up mid-single digits, low teens on an FX-neutral basis in Q3, while all other brands' direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the established brands.
We expect adjusted operating income of $255 million to $260 million in Q3, representing margins of about 32% at the midpoint of the ranges. We expect lower year-over-year sales and marketing spend, a much lower year-over-year growth rate in product and development than in Q2 2022 and a continued increase in App Store fees. The lower-than-expected revenue contribution from Tinder, which is our highest margin business, has a meaningful negative effect on our overall company margins.
For the full year, we're now estimating $195 million of year-over-year FX impacts, which is $72 million more than at our last earnings call and $163 million more than when we first gave our thoughts about 2022 back in November of '21. We estimate FX is causing a 6-point reduction in year-over-year revenue growth for full year 2022, 2 points worse than at the time of our last earnings call.
For Q4, we expect limited improvement in our year-over-year top line growth rate and modest improvement in AOI margins compared to Q3. While we expect the second half of the year to be below our growth targets, we believe the company remains positioned to deliver accelerating revenue growth as we move through 2023, driven by improved product execution at Tinder. The biggest unknown we face relates to the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business.
The consumer is facing significant pressure from rising gas and food prices, constraining purchasing power. Our product is a small purchase and one that leads to happiness. So consumers are low to stop or reduce it. If the economy continues to worsen, we expect our business to remain resilient, but we may see modest effects at some of our brands, particularly those that cater to lowering consumers.
We believe subscriptions, which constitute the vast majority of our revenue, will remain sticky, but it's possible consumers will pull back modestly on a la carte purchases, which tend to be more discretionary. We expect our Hinge business to remain largely immune from overall consumer spending pullbacks given its more affluent user base and have seen no impact to date. We'll continue to monitor these trends and provide an update on our next earnings call.
Our category provides ample runway for growth, which we can achieve by growing users and by increasing payer penetration and RPP. It is up to us to execute on the opportunities. The recent changes we've made at Tinder should better position us to perform the way we have historically. While the business is facing some temporary challenges, we will remain disciplined on costs, especially in marketing and hiring. Our longer term prospects remain bright. And our goal remains to deliver strong, consistent growth and profitability for our shareholders. We believe our combination of growth and profitability as well as our free cash flow generation is one that few other companies can achieve.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

First of all, I wasn't expecting to have to manage a CEO transition so early in my tenure, and I know it's not ideal to have 2 Tinder CEOs in 2 years. But with Renate's departure, I wanted to act quickly and be decisive and put in a team that I felt confident in. We've assembled a team of all stars from Tinder and Match Group, and we also brought in Mark as CPO, who I've known for over 15 years. Faye is moving into a newly formed position as COO of Tinder and will improve execution across the entire organization. Tom has done a great job leading engineering for the last 5 years at Tinder. And we're delighted that he's going to continue to lead our engineering teams. Melissa is an award-winning CMO, who's done great things at OkCupid, and we're really happy that she is bringing her expertise to our biggest business. And Mark joined Tinder 1 week after I joined Match Group, and he's my top choice to lead product as I've worked with him at Electronic Arts and have admired his accomplishments leading product teams.
This team in place is already working really well together and driving the business forward. And we think the new CEO, once in place, is going to really enjoy working with this strong team. When it comes to finding the new CEO, first and foremost, I want to break the cycle of short-tenured leaders at Tinder. I want someone who's experienced, creative leader that inspires and motivates team, but is also aligned with our growth vision for the business. I will be personally leading this search. But in the meantime, I'm really excited to immerse myself in Los Angeles with the Tinder team. With leadership change comes tremendous opportunity, and I really look forward to taking this team and Tinder to the next level of growth."

So we don't expect the same revenue bump that we typically see.
As an example, a lot of time was building -- was spent building Explore. It's a strong gateway with high engagement, but we haven't succeeded yet on innovating the user experience and then also building monetization features to maximize its potential. I do believe that there is a lot of market opportunity and great product ideas at Tinder, but it's all about execution.

Here's the way that I kind of think about the back half of the year generally, Q3 and Q4, which is between what we expect to deliver now for the back half of the year and versus what would have resulted in our hitting our recent guidance, which was low end of the 15% to 20% range for 2022. There's a gap there, and it really results from 3 areas.
The first, which is about 1/3 of the gap, is from additional FX headwinds. We talked a lot in the prepared remarks about how much that has gotten more severe. And so about 1/3 of the gap comes from that. Of the rest, about half of the rest or 1/3 of the total comes from what BK just talked about, which is Tinder missed execution and the lack of delivery of initiatives, not having hit product road map and delivered as we expected in the first half of the year.
And the other piece comes from a variety of other factors across the business: weakness in APAC, especially Japan; weakness in live streaming and to the established brands; and generally, some effects of macro weakness, we think, might be in that bucket as well. So those are the 3 buckets which, of the total gap, I think each account for about 1/3.
And now while we're not expecting much improvement in Q4 compared to Q3, we do expect momentum to build after that and to carry over and improve as we move through 2023."

We've seen it excel in marketing and product development, driven by Hinge's awesome team and culture, coupled with Match's expertise.

One, there's still ample runway on monetization and user growth in core markets as we continue to roll out features and marketing campaigns to drive this growth. For example, we're really excited about the next monetization feature, which is a premium subscription tier.
Second is capitalizing on product market fit that Hinge has created and translating that into as many markets as fast as we can.

I want to point out a couple of things as it relates to Hinge and margins. The first thing is, while we are being very judicious and cautious about marketing spend across the company as well as on hiring now and going forward, we recognize that Hinge is the brightest spot in the portfolio. And it is our strongest growth business. It's a very important business to us. And we are going to continue to invest at the right levels in that business, both on the marketing side as well as in product and development and people. So we're being judicious, but we're being thoughtful. And we want to make sure Hinge has the resources it needs to continue on a growth trajectory.
And I don't see issues there in terms of the way we are treating expenses as it relates to marketing or headcount. I think Hinge has the resources to continue to grow exactly as we're planning for it to grow. So I want to make sure people understand the nuances there and the distinctions between businesses that are struggling more to grow, where we're going to be more judicious on marketing and hiring versus a business like Hinge, which is growing strongly and we're investing in.
As far as what kind of margins we can achieve, I think that we are still very smart and efficient with our marketing spend. We are spending where we see traction in the business. Like now in a market like Germany, we see the organic traction. We're investing into it with marketing spend. That has been our playbook and continues to be our playbook at Hinge. And we think that Hinge is already in position to achieve margins that are close to the company levels of margin. And we think that, that's what Hinge can achieve over time. And so we don't think Hinge will be a drag on our margins.
We think that Hinge will contribute nicely to the overall company margins and still grow at the levels that we've been talking about as we've been providing our outlook, which, as we say, is 50% for this year, and we think will be very strong into 2023 as well. So hopefully, that answers your questions.
Can we go to the next one, please, operator?"

And as I talked about a little bit with the answer to John's question as well about 2023, so I'll try to weave that together. First of all, I want to say off the bat, we remain confident that this business can return to mid- to high-teens revenue growth. There's a lot of opportunity for us, and it really comes down to execution. And right now, we didn't execute as we needed to and as we expected to in the first part of the year. So we need a few quarters to rebuild the momentum in the business. And as BK has talked about extensively, in particular, we need a few quarters to get the Tinder team to improve their overall execution and deliver on their product road map.
And so as you know, as that takes place, we need to build back into stronger and stronger growth. And I think that will happen as we move into and then through 2023 at a measured pace in terms of improving the growth. Obviously, our goal is to deliver more than that, but our goal is to at least deliver strong and improving growth as we move through the quarter, starting in 2023.
We will provide more details and specifics on what I think we can deliver for 2023 in the upcoming calls, as is our custom. So we'll give you a better sense of what exactly the cadence is going to be like and what levels we think we can get to. But our goal is to get back to where we have been. We think there's opportunity to do that. And as long as we execute, and in particular, the Tinder team executes on that, we do think we will get there."

I can take that one. Lauren, thanks for the great questions. I feel confident that coins and virtual goods are a compelling offering in Tinder and can lead to significant monetization of powered users, who I believe are currently under monetized. Mark and I have spent most of our career in gaming, focusing on building such ecosystems, and we bring this expertise to the table. I love the idea of virtual goods and currency in Tinder, but I believe it hasn't been approached in a completely logical way.
For instance, my experience in gaming, demand for virtual goods and collectibles are rolled out first, and then you launch the currency to get these items later. While it's frustrating to pause the efforts, I think it's super important that Mark and I deliver the right value proposition, so this can be a long-term revenue stream.
In terms of your question around shorter term subscription packages, historically, Match Group has not offered these. But we are going to start testing a variety of short-term subscriptions at different price points to see what works. We plan our initial rollout of these programs this upcoming fall."

The",405,"And then maybe I can just jump in on the second half outlook. I want to clarify something that you said, which is that implies we are counting on coins or even virtual goods for the second half delivery of our revenue targets. And that isn't the case. There wasn't much, if anything, baked into the second half outlook around coins and virtual goods. So the fact that we're delaying that is not the driver of the shortfall versus our expectations for the second half. But there were a series of other less keynote kind of initiatives and optimizations that were expected in the first half of 2022 to help us deliver the second half revenue and also more initiatives in the back half of the year to help deliver the second half revenue.
And it's on that series of initiatives, kind of less sexy, less notable initiatives but still very important initiatives, that really has not taken place. And it explains why changes in the team at Tinder have been made to try to make sure that we deliver more fully on the initiatives and optimizations that we have in our plans. And so it's that kind of shortfall and delay that's really causing the issue.
I think if you look back where we were in May, we still believe that we were going to deliver those initiatives. And right now, I think our confidence in that happening in the back half of the year has come down. We've made the changes, and we think we'll be positioned to have more momentum as we get out of 2022 and into 2023.
And if you look back into last year, you'll note that we had a very strong performance in Q3 and Q4, as I called out. And the reason for that is we did deliver on significant initiatives, not particularly massive initiatives, but a series of important initiatives and optimizations in the early part of the year as well as in Q3, and I talked about it in the remarks. And that really propelled strong payer additions in Q3 and into Q4 and strong revenue growth. That materialized in 2021, and it hasn't materialized in 2022. And we need to deliver on those kinds of initiatives and product improvements to drive the revenue growth. And the team at Tinder needs to do that, and we think we'll now be positioned to do that again."

And we expect our business would be minimally impacted in a downturn as well. I think as you rightly point out, if there were any impact, it would be at the brands that serve lower income consumers with less discretionary income. We wouldn't expect to see, for example, effect at our business like Hinge, which tends to have a much more affluent customer. And so far, at Hinge, we definitely have not seen any impact from the overall macroeconomic environment.
We also think that the subscription nature of our business does -- is more sticky and does provide us with some insulation from an economic downturn. But on the other hand, there is some a la carte revenue, and that's more discretionary and probably would be at more risk in a downturn. So while right now, we don't see any real impacts to our business for macroeconomic factors, we are watching for them closely. It's something we want to monitor as we get out of the year because we do think there are a lot of crosswinds going on globally.
But I would say that I don't see much downside to our 2022, even if things did continue to deteriorate. I think we've kind of assumed the right level of potential risk there as well in our 2022 outlook. So we'll see what materializes in the next 6 months. But I think that your view of kind of the resiliency of our business, the way that affluent consumers, in particular, are more insulated, the risk more on the people with lower income, more discretionary spending, I think, is the right way to think about our business."

So -- and there's even a greater opportunity in APAC and the rest of the world. We have demonstrated that product innovation leads to product adoption, which drives overall category growth. It's important to continue to innovate on our products in order to introduce online dating to new users.
A great example is at Hinge. It has great user momentum and a strong top-of-funnel growth, directly driven by exciting new features such as voice props. Tinder has not seen that same level of product innovation recently. But we feel like we have the right marketing and product teams in place now to innovate and drive its next level of growth."

Let me just make sure that everyone understands kind of our outlook, and there's clarity around that. So we're basically saying, at the midpoint of the ranges in Q3, there'll be about 32% AOI margins. And then we're expecting some modest improvement from there, which I think you could read as 100 to 150 basis points of sequential improvement in Q4.
In terms of the overall year-over-year change in the margin drivers, let me see if I can kind of do this off the top of my head. And so I would say App Store fees are probably 1.5 points of headwinds. So there's still a meaningful headwind on year-over-year margins in Q3, and probably headcount is maybe 2.5 points of headwind. So you have 4 points of headwind from the app stores and the headcount moves that we've made.
You probably get about 1 point of benefit from sales and marketing on the other hand. And I would say there's probably some small other effects from other items, and that's probably a little bit of a headwind. So I probably am around 3.5% or so of year-over-year decline. So that probably rounds to your 4%. But I think it's primarily the headcount and the App Store fees with some offset from the lower marketing spend.
In terms of your second question, I don't expect there to be significant leverage on the product development line in the upcoming quarters. But I do think that as we turn the corner into 2023, we'll start to see the effects of the pullbacks in hiring that we're making. And also, we'll start to see stronger revenue growth, stronger revenue generation from Tinder, in particular, as the new team really starts to accelerate and build momentum.
And that will help drive momentum on the product development side, as well as should help overall company margins because, as I mentioned in my remarks, the fact that Tinder, which is a very high-margin business, is not contributing as it has been does have a significant effect on the overall company margin. So getting Tinder going is important not only from a revenue growth perspective, but also from a margin improvement, margin acceleration perspective. So it is the key. It's the reason we've made the changes we are driving to. And I think we have optimism as we turn the corner into 2023 on all those aspects of the business."

Let me take the second one first because I have a tendency to forget them if I don't do it that way. In Japan, I think the thing that's important to understand is that they really put a lot of restrictions into place in that market, 5 states of emergency over a period of a year or so. And you have a conservative culture, I think, still kind of a reluctant dating culture, still getting used to dating apps. And I think that has frozen their behavior to a large extent. And so while we did see some initial improvement once the restrictions were lifted, that was probably people who had pent-up demand, who were kind of eager and wanted to get out there and were waiting for the restrictions to lift. So you saw a little bit of a bump, a little bit of improvement out of the gate, but then there was no follow-on from that.
And that is kind of the case today. And unfortunately, in that market, you also have COVID rising again, which has only made people, again, more conservative in their behavior. So I think it's going to take a few quarters more to normalize in Japan. I think all the macro trends that have always made that a good market for us, a low marriage rate, hard to find your partner in that market, I think, are all still there. But some of this needs to normalize.
And I think, as BK said in his remarks, we haven't quite seen a full return to normal behavior. And I don't think we have a full understanding in every market of kind of the impact of COVID on people's behavior. So Japan, I think, is a really important case study. And given how severely they took their response to COVID, it's going to take some time for it to bounce back. And I think that's what we're expecting in our outlook. And I think that's the right way to look at it based on everything we see now.
Obviously, we're hoping it bounce back faster. We will do everything we can to try to make that happen. But I think that, that is what we're dealing with in the Japan market.
In terms of kind of buybacks and M&A, I want to point out, in dating, in particular, we think we've done a lot of good acquisitions. If you look at Hinge in particular, it's a home-run acquisition, just a phenomenal acquisition, and there's much more we can do with that business.
And if you go prior to Hinge, you look at the Plenty of Fish acquisition, you look at the Pairs acquisition in Japan, despite the recent trends in that market, those have been very, very strong acquisitions for us as well. And we're very optimistic about The League, which is the most recent acquisition we've made in the dating space.
So if we're able to find more compelling targets in the dating space, we absolutely would like to continue to act on them, and we won't hesitate to do so. We have the financial flexibility to do them. So there's no issues there.
By contrast, when you look at the acquisition that we made outside of dating, it hasn't gone the way we would have hoped. We are working on it. We think the team is still fantastic. There's more we can do with that business. But there's no denying that, that acquisition of Hyperconnect has not worked out the way we had hoped, at least in the first year. And so the bar has been raised around non-dating acquisitions. That's not to say that we wouldn't do them. But we need to be more convinced in both the growth that can be derived from those kinds of acquisitions as well as the profitability levels. And we need to see a clear path to profitability, if not immediate profitability. So I think the standards will be higher for an acquisition outside of dating.
So that's kind of how we think about our overall acquisition strategy, and it's something that BK and I have spent time chatting about. And we will continue to refine our thinking around kind of M&A, because it is a core element of our toolbox and something that we have been good at.
All that being said, right now, the way we look at it, we generate a lot of excess capital, probably $1 billion or so a year, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less, but that's a good number to think about. And so we need to figure out what to do with that capital and use it in the most effective way. And right now, given the market dislocation and where our stock price is, betting on ourselves is our best bet. It's our highest returning bet that we can make, and we're going to continue to do that aggressively with our excess capital. And we'll always be dynamic in this. This is a fluid set of decisions, M&A, buyback shares, whatever makes sense. We constantly discuss this internally with our Board, and we want to maintain that flexibility.
But in the environment that we're operating in at the moment, we think that betting on ourselves is absolutely the right thing to do. We did it in the second quarter, and we expect to continue to do that in the third quarter as well. So hopefully, that answers your 2 questions. I know we're getting a little bit close to time. So why don't I turn it over to BK for a couple of closing remarks."

I'm delighted to be on our second earnings call at the company. The time has flown by, and I attribute that to the team coming together, making decisive calls and taking real action to accelerate momentum. 
As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. When you exclude FX impact, we saw double-digit growth. There is still a lot of work to do. And while the macroeconomic environment is proving more challenging, we have a great team and an excellent portfolio of brands. That makes me optimistic that we can create significant long-term shareholder value. 
After just a few months, the team at Tinder is gelling well together, and there has been a palpable change in the culture. We have made some big changes to improve organizational efficiencies and operations to get the team shipping product and accelerating growth. Some examples of this are bringing the revenue and product teams together so they're collaborating and supporting one another as one team in our shared mission. The marketing team is also working with and challenging the product teams to ensure that we're building features that users can get excited about. 
Whenever reorganizations occur, there's always a risk of attrition. But with this new team in place, we haven't seen any. That's promising. We aren't dealing with massive disruption. Instead, we are getting more products into testing, working together to eventually return Tinder to previous growth levels. That won't happen overnight, but we are moving in the right direction. 
I am excited about how our 2023 road map is beginning to take shape, which centers in 4 key areas: providing our women users more tailored experiences; targeting Gen Z through various product initiatives; evaluating virtual goods and coins to unlock untapped power users; and finally, creating more targeted monetization opportunities, including an expanded focus on users who have not previously paid. 
Additionally, we have let the market tell the brand narrative about Tinder for too long. We recognize that a powerful Tinder narrative is a critical component to accelerating growth again. Going forward, we are working to activate levers across global marketing brand campaigns to bring to life the endless Tinder success stories over the past 10 years. 
The marketing team is working hand in hand with product to redefine the narrative for the next generation of singles. While it will take some time to see measurable changes overall, I fully believe in the team's ability to experiment, learn, build and ultimately deliver the best dating experiences for our users. 
Tinder has transformed the dating category over the last 10 years, and I am committed to making the next 10 even more exciting. Our search for a full-time CEO at Tinder is ongoing. We've met a broad set of talented and diverse leaders with a deep bench of consumer digital experience. 
I'm leading the charge on the search. But it's worth pointing out that we've already done a lot of the hard work that a new CEO typically has to do like establishing the leadership team, making the organization more nimble and increasing collaboration. It is critically important to me that this new leader can seamlessly move into the role and work with the current team with minimal disruption with a focus on growth and profitability. This is a role that I want to be very deliberate about. So in the meantime, I will remain interim CEO. The business plans are moving forward, and I'm expecting execution and performance will continue to improve over the next coming months. 
Hinge continued to be a bright spot this quarter. They are delivering on their localization strategy to grow users and market share globally with a successful launch in Germany and reaching new markets throughout Europe. 
In October, Hinge hit record downloads in both the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., where Hinge has quickly become the third most popular dating app by downloads, the brand continues to innovate on the product experience. After the successful launch of audio prompts last year, the team was quick to roll out video prompts and prompt polls, giving daters more ways to express themselves and hopefully land a date. 
Later this month, Hinge will start testing a new premium subscription tier. We have decided to hold back the full launch of the new tier until Q1, the peak season for dating. I'm really excited about how it's coming together. And I'm confident that it will resonate with the user base and provide an opportunity to drive RPP meaningfully higher. 
As a company, we have achieved a lot in a short amount of time. We have worked diligently to right the ship at Tinder, pushed forward with our growth plans at Hinge and have continued to navigate the current challenging operating environment. 
At the same time, there is a significant amount of work to be done and innovations to be built that will further accelerate our growth. We are currently in the middle of our planning process for 2023 across the portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more during our next earnings call. 
One thing I did want to call out as I spent more time with the business is we have different brands in different stages of growth. Given the current macro environment, we must focus our investment in brands that are growing and pull back in areas that are not driving growth. This has become a strategic imperative for us in 2023. I'll be able to share more on this strategy after we complete our strategic plans for next year. 
Our world has never been more connected, and I'm so proud that we are continuing to deliver on our company's mission of connecting millions of people around the world in meaningful ways. As I've told everyone before, I'm passionate about people, culture and product, and look forward to improving the overall user experience across the portfolio with our talented group of technologists around the world. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."

In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-",1629,"Thanks, BK, and hello again, everyone. In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact was $8 million worse than we expected when we provided our Q3 outlook on our August earnings call. 
Our direct revenue also grew 1% year-over-year. It grew 5% year-over-year in the Americas with growth at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa but declines at the Established Brands. Direct revenue declined 1% year-over-year in Europe but was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder and Hinge. Direct revenue declined 5% in APAC and Other but was up 16% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder. 
Total payers were 16.5 million, an increase of 2% from the prior year quarter. Payers were down 1% year-over-year in each of the Americas and Europe and up 12% in APAC and Other. Tinder payer additions grew stronger than we had expected, while our Established Brands, including Match, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish saw year-over-year payer declines of over 15% in aggregate. 
RPP was flat year-over-year at $16.02 in Q3. RPP was up 6% in the Americas, a 1 point sequential improvement, reflecting higher average rates for subscriptions and increased average a la carte purchases per payer at Tinder and Hinge. 
RPP was flat year-over-year in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was down 14% in APAC and Other due to the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and the Turkish lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide again in Q3, up 16% in Europe and 4% in APAC and Other. 
Tinder performed slightly above our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $460 million, up 6% year-over-year, 16% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 7% year-over-year, adding 700,000 payers to 11.1 million and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX. 
Tinder RPP was up 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Recall that Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now facing that challenging comp. 
All other brands direct revenue was down 5% year-over-year in Q3 driven by an 8% payer decline and 3% RPP growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continue to drive the growth. We continue to pull back on marketing spend for some of our Established Brands. And Plenty of Fish, in particular, continue to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions. 
In Asia, Hyperconnect's Azar app revenue was down 7% year-over-year. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it was up more than 10% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen. 
Hakuna continues to face challenges with revenue down low double digits year-over-year. Payers continue to be affected by market softness in Japan with only a slight year-over-year increase in revenue but down more than 15% as reported. 
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, flat to Q2 but down 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $211 million in Q3 with margins of 26%. Adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at $284 million, representing a margin of 35%. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 3% year-over-year in Q3. Cost of revenue grew 6% year-over-year primarily due to higher [indiscernible] fees, including the $8 million placed into the escrow for the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 31% of total revenue, up 2 points year-over-year. 
Selling and marketing spend decreased $24 million or 16% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our more Established Brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Selling and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 60%. 
G&A expense rose $11 million or 10% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 1 point from the prior year quarter. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees but higher compensation and headcount expense as well as an increase in travel expenses of $4 million as we continue to return to a more normal cadence of business travel. 
Product development costs grew 31% year-over-year and were 11% of revenue as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage was 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3.1x at the end of Q3. 
We ended the quarter with $398 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed $267 million in the first month of Q3 to buy back 4.3 million of our shares at a VWAP of approximately $63 per share on a trade date basis. 
While the stock continued to decline significantly after we deployed our buyback, we believe our stock repurchase represents a sound long-term investment. We currently have 5.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization. 
For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $780 million to $790 million. We anticipate nearly $70 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q4, meaning that total revenue growth would be nearly 9 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This headwind is $14 million more than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call. 
We expect Tinder's Q4 direct revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year, up high single digits on an FX-neutral basis with mid-single-digit payers growth as ALC softness due to weak macroeconomic conditions impacts payers. We plan to adjust some of our merchandising tactics to help offset this. 
Historically, we've primarily offered large high-cost bundles of ALC features, for example, $30 bundles of Super Likes, which had been quite successful. In the current environment, we're adjusting our merchandising to emphasize smaller, lower-priced bundles to our users who see value in these ALC features but are now more price-sensitive. 
All other brands direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the Established Brands as well as at Pairs and Hyperconnect due to FX. 
We expect indirect revenue to be down about 20% year-over-year, given pressures we're seeing building in the ad sales market. We expect adjusted operating income of $270 million to $275 million in Q4, representing margins of about 35% at the midpoint of the ranges. 
In Q4, we plan to increase marketing spend at Hinge, both in the U.S. where we see terrific momentum as well as in its international expansion markets as per its plan. We also expect to spend up slightly at Tinder and to launch a new brand marketing campaign at our Match brand. 
Given lower spend at our other brands, we expect meaningfully lower year-over-year aggregate selling and marketing spend again in Q4. While visibility into 2023 is challenging, we're focused on delivering 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. 
We believe Tinder is positioned to deliver a similar range of growth. This equates to total revenue up high single digits to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis as we expect FX to be about a 3-point drag in 2023. 
We anticipate that the Emerging Brands such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK will deliver sufficient growth to offset the declines at the Established Brands. We expect Hinge to deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue in 2023. We expect the company as a whole to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023 driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder. 
The 5% to 10% top line range reflects 3 key variables. One, quality of product execution and the timing/success initiatives at Tinder. If Tinder executes well, growth will be on the higher end of the range. Two, the strength of the contribution from international expansion and the new premium tier at Hinge. And three, macroeconomic impacts, particularly on lowering consumers and especially on a la carte purchases primarily at Tinder. 
On the AOI side, we're still calibrating spend levels and the investments that we want to make in 2023. We expect incremental sales and marketing spend at Hinge to support its global user growth, including in its expansion across Europe. Despite the investment, we expect Hinge to maintain AOI margins of 30% plus. 
We expect to spend incremental marketing at Tinder to support its product enhancements and drive user growth. Even with that, we're confident Tinder can continue to achieve AOI margins in the 50% range. 
We also intend to invest in The League, which we acquired earlier this year and believe has solid growth potential. We plan to invest in incubating a couple of new apps, which we're confident can better serve certain demographic groups than the existing offerings. 
To enable us to make the investments in our growth businesses, we plan to reduce operating expenses in other areas of the company to ensure that we can deliver at least flat year-over-year margins in 2023. This assumes no change to current App Store policies. 
We believe our business continues to achieve profitability and cash flow generation that has few parallels in [indiscernible]. We've always been conscious of delivering profitability and cash flow. But in the current operating environment, our focus on these items is being sharpened significantly. Our job for the coming year is to invest wisely in select growth opportunities and to manage costs judiciously elsewhere. And our team is up to the task. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And we're seeing strong subscriptions, and they remain very sticky. 
The main impact that we're seeing is from impulse and occasional buyers as they tend to be more price-sensitive, and they are impacted more by macroeconomic factors. As Gary pointed out, we've historically marketed our ALC products in large bundles, and that have led to significant purchases of these large bundles. 
Therefore, we're moving quickly, and we're adjusting our ALC merchandising to emphasize smaller bundles to more price-sensitive customers. The customers that are most affected are younger users with less discretionary income, but we don't see a difference across geographies. 
This is a reminder that conditions are ever changing. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we have to be nimble and be able to react to our consumers throughout the year. I am impressed by the speed at which Tinder can diagnose and react to these type of effects. The Tinder team is actively working on mitigating this as much as possible, but I expect this is going to take some time and iteration."

I think when you look at our Q3, we provided a pretty conservative outlook for the quarter, in part because of all the disruption that was going on at Tinder. We weren't sure exactly how things were going to react to all the changes that we made. And so we wanted to be a little bit conservative in the Q3 outlook. And I think that led to the improvement versus expectations. 
In Q4, though, we're seeing a pretty significant deterioration in trends even over the last few weeks. We think the macro environment has gotten much more challenging, and we're nervous about it for Q4 and going forward. And so as a result of that, our outlook for Q4 is perhaps lower than you would have thought because we think the caution is warranted, given the change in trends and the weakness in the overall macro environment, which, as BK just said, is really affecting Tinder on the a la carte side as users, especially younger users, have less discretionary income are being a little bit more cautious in their purchasing. 
And we think that effect is going to linger for a period of time. We are taking actions to offset that, and I think some of those will help offset the effects of it, but it is going to take some time for that to work its way through as well. 
The other thing I would point out is that we have less product momentum going into Q4 than we typically have and certainly than we did last year when we had a very successful Q3 product adjustments that led to solid momentum in Q4. And remember, product work in the previous quarter or the previous 2 quarters gives us momentum into the next quarter. So we don't have the momentum we'd like to see or that we typically have leading into Q4. But it is building as the Tinder team makes more progress and influence new things. 
And so we think that, that momentum will build, and that gives us optimism that as the Tinder team continues to execute the way they need to execute, we'll start to see some improved momentum into 2023."

And to do this, we have to build the virtual goods and then create the demand. After that, you can create the coin economy to purchase those goods. 
I asked the teams to rethink that road map and delay the launch into next year. They've been working on it. I'm excited because the Tinder CPO has great experience in building these types of economies. I'm really excited to see this roll out in 2023. 
And then to your question about advertising, over the last 5 years, advertising has been a modest focus at Tinder, but the reality is over 85% of our users don't pay us anything. In my previous history, I've seen real success in monetizing users that don't pay. 
So I've asked the team to embrace advertising monetization culturally. I think there's a real opportunity to implement proven ideas from games that I've utilized in the past, for example, rewarded video. I think over time, I would like to see us get through $100 million in advertising revenue, which is about double the revenue that we have today. Thanks so much for the questions."

And so in Japan, what we've assumed is really no material change in the trends that we're seeing in the Japanese market next year. I'm hopeful we can do a little bit better than that and start to see some recovery, but we're not really seeing that yet. 
And so we've assumed that the conditions largely stay the same next year, which basically means we think that our Pairs business can achieve some modest improvement in revenue next year. But probably on a FX -- on a U.S. dollar basis, it's probably going to be down year-over-year. So modestly up in local currency but down on a dollars basis. 
And I think that business can probably achieve something in the neighborhood of 25% margin. So a reasonably profitable business, but the growth trajectory has really changed. And I'm hopeful that will change for the better leading into the future. 
Hyperconnect has a couple of moving parts as well. The Azar business is very encouraging as we showed in the letter and we've talked about. We feel good about that. And I think we will continue to see some reasonable level of growth from the Azar business. 
Hyperconnect -- sorry, Hakuna, at Hyperconnect is more challenged. And we're assuming a little bit of improvement in that business next year compared to this year but not dramatically so. And so when you put that all together, I think that Hyperconnect overall will show some modest level of revenue growth next year in local currency. But again, when you -- FX affected, I think we will be down on a U.S. dollar basis. So that's what we're planning for. 
So there are some headwinds from a dollar perspective, both on the Japanese business at Pairs and on the Hyperconnect businesses. I think Azar and Hakuna together can probably do about a 10% adjusted operating income margin. We're going to be disciplined on marketing spend and headcount there to try to drive improving margins. And we got to keep driving margins up in that business. And that is something that our new team there working with our existing CEO, [ Sam ], is very focused on."

We love the questions around marketing. So traditionally, Tinder has not spent much on marketing. They've always spent about less than 10% of revenue, and we don't see that changing. 
Thankfully, Tinder is not reliant on marketing to grow the business. However, this is a 10-year-old brand. And especially with younger users who are new to the category, we haven't taken the opportunity to establish our narrative. I believe that Tinder, which is a category leader, has been too quiet in the market for too long. In 2023, we're going to increase marketing spend to establish stronger brand narrative. 
But to answer your question, it's still going to be below 10% of revenue. With our new CMO, we see great opportunities to get brand message out there in a creative manner and market some of our newer product features that we have planned for next year. 
These 2 together should help accelerate user growth at Tinder. And even -- once again, and even with incremental marketing spend, we expect Tinder margin in 2023 to be in the 50% range as they always have been. Thanks for the question."

So if I",149,"Guys, thanks for sharing the initial outlook for 2023. We understand how challenging visibility is at this point, but still appreciate it. 
So maybe just a follow-up to the last question about marketing since BK, he liked the marketing questions. So if I understand it correctly, and this is a question about 2023. It seems like Tinder, Hinge and Match will see increase in marketing spend while all the other brands would be down. 
I guess the question is, is this a temporary strategy to weather the macro environment in 2023? Or do you see this more as a permanent pivot, permanent shift in your strategy going forward? 
And maybe just a quick one. You guys talked about how Hinge should contribute at least an additional $100 million in 2023. What do you expect that to contribute in 2022 just to have a base off to work off of?"
355279,1804513323,2671618,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on t",1137,"So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on the pound. 
And so we had targeted $300 million. I think we'll probably fall about $15 million short of that. So let's call it, $285 million or so for the year. And then we said we think we can deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue next year, so that you can add that together. 
Obviously, the $100 million depends really on the success of the international expansion, but more importantly, on the success and take rate around the new pricing tier, the new premium tier. And so that's really the thing that we don't know. 
We've made some reasonable estimates on what we think is going to happen with that tier. But we'll know a lot more in a few weeks or certainly by the end of the year as we're planning to start testing the middle of this month. And so by the end of this year, we'll have a much better sense. And so when we get back together again in February, we'll be able to give you some updates on that tier as well as on the overall outlook for Hinge revenue growth next year. So that was one piece of your question. 
I did also just want to comment on the 2023 outlook just since you raised it, which is by necessity, we wanted to provide an outlook for next year as we often do on this call. But this year, that is particularly challenging because there are so many moving pieces, both in our business and from a macro perspective. 
And so we don't really know what the macro environment is going to be through next year, what's going to happen from rates and recession and all the things that you know well. So we've tried to make our best guess at that. 
But clearly, we'll have to see how things play out in the coming months to get a better sense of what 2023 looks like. But sitting here today, making our best guess on what economic conditions are going to be for next year, we're confident in that 5% to 10% growth for the overall company as well as at Tinder on the revenue side. 
So I just wanted to kind of mention some of that so everyone understands how we've approached providing an outlook for next year at this point, given all the various crosswinds. 
And then on the last question about the marketing spend. You are right to assume that we're going to see marketing spend increases next year at Tinder for the reason that BK explained about wanting to make sure we establish the brand narrative better than we have in the past as well as at Hinge, which we talked about extensively. 
And that's really 2 things. One, to keep supporting its really strong and impressive user growth in the English-speaking markets, U.S., U.K., in particular, as well as continue to build around the world where there's a lot of momentum. Things are going well, more than according to plan, and we feel great about our international expansion opportunity at Hinge. We want to keep investing in that. 
So those are the places where we are clearly investing meaningful dollars on marketing side. I did want to correct, you said you thought there would be an increase in marketing spend at our Match brand next year. I don't think that's going to be the case. 
There is going to be an increase in our marketing spend at the Match brand in Q4 of this year, but that's because we have a discrete new brand campaign that we're launching. So there will be a year-over-year increase in Q4 of this year at Match, but we're not planning for that next year. 
In fact, we expect marketing spend at all the Established Brands, including Match, to be down in 2023 over 2022. And we're using that to offset the investments we're making at the Hinge brand and at the Tinder brand. 
I would also say that our approach to marketing spend and how we're thinking about our strategy around that is not about weathering the current macroeconomic environment, and it's also not a permanent strategy. It's really a plan for targeted spend increases to achieve our strategic goals. 
So our strategic goals are at Hinge to grow the business internationally, and that's why we're investing. Our strategic goals at Tinder is to establish the brand narrative and take back some of the brand narrative and make some more noise in the market. And we're planning to do that with increased marketing spend next year. And then we'll sort of go from there. 
We're nimble in marketing spend, and we will continue to spend where we think it makes sense and pull back where we think it doesn't make sense. 
A couple of other areas I would point to, where we think we will spend up next year. One would be The League, which we recently acquired. And we think there's significant opportunity for growth of The League, and we plan to invest into that business on the marketing side. We're excited about the opportunities there. 
And then second is some new apps that we're thinking about incubating. We think there are some markets where the demographics are underserved. And we can build some apps that really satisfy those demographics better than the current offerings. 
To the extent we do that, user growth will be a priority. Driving user growth and marketing will be a component of that strategy in 2023 once we incubate the new app. So we expect to spend up to the extent we incubate some new apps, which is in our plan for 2023. 
And then I would just add that philosophically, we're maintaining strict ROI discipline on our marketing spend, as we always do, but especially in a tougher environment. And we believe that all of our brands [indiscernible] is meeting or exceeding our ROI threshold. 
So that is a lens we're going to continue to apply very, very carefully, especially in a challenging environment. We're hopeful that if the economy does soften, we will see some relief in terms of what has been an expensive and competitive marketing environment, but we have not seen that yet. 
I think it's logical to think it's coming, given all the headwinds in the economy. But if we do see that, we would look to capitalize on that as well. So hopefully, that answers the different parts of your questions, and I thank you for your questions."

There is -- it is existing in some other pockets like our Plenty of Fish business as well. And look, it's hard to tell exactly how much macro weakness we're seeing across the portfolio. But the thing that we're particularly focused on is the weakness on the ALC side at Tinder. 
I think we've made some reasonable assumptions based on what we're seeing for Q4 that give me confidence in our range that we provided for Q4. Obviously, I don't know how much things are going to deteriorate or not in 2023. And so that's what makes guiding for 2023 more challenging.

So you're right, and I said it before, we're investing marketing dollars in the business where we see growth opportunities, Tinder, Hinge, The League, et cetera. And we're offsetting those with reductions in the more Established Brands. 
The net result of that is that we expect marketing spend next year to be roughly consistent as a percentage of revenue with what we've seen in 2022. And so overall, our goal for next year is to have flat margins for the year, hopefully, do better than that, but that's our target. 
But you may see small fluctuations quarter-to-quarter depending on the cadence of marketing spend. If we spend on a bigger campaign in Q1, that might have some effect on margins versus if we don't have that in Q2. 
So you might see margins be plus or minus a little bit year-over-year in each quarter depending on the marketing spend cadence and what's going on from a campaign perspective. Outside of marketing spend, we're going to offset any incremental margin headwinds that exist with improvements elsewhere to hit that goal of at least flat margins. 
And then you're right, Tinder is a very high-margin asset for us, and we talked about that already. And so improvement in margins and ultimately hitting our long-term margin goal really is dependent on or the factor that Tinder really accelerate its growth and really contribute meaningful growth to us. 
So that is the #1 job for the company is to really accelerate Tinder growth and get it back to where it's been historically or at least closer to that, which will help us get closer to our overall long-term margin target. 
The only other thing I'd point out around margins, and we mentioned this in the letter, is that our outlook for margins doesn't assume any relief from the App Stores at all, which we think is the prudent thing to assume at the moment. That being said, the Digital Markets Act went into effect yesterday in the U.K, and we are expecting changes to App Store policies as a result of that. And there's actions in other jurisdiction as well, markets like India, for example. And so we believe that it's likely that we're going to see relief from App Stores in 2023, if not in 2024 at the latest. 
And so I do think there is upside to our margins as that plays through. But right now, our outlook doesn't contemplate any of that."

So when",833,"Sure. Let me take that one as well. When you look at our P&L, a lot of our costs come out of IFBs, which obviously we're nowhere near in control over as well as things like web hosting, AWS, things like that, which are difficult for us to affect. So when you look at what we can control, and we do want to control what we can control in the current environment, marketing and headcount as well as some other operating expense items are things that we really can control and can control costs on those fronts. 
I just talked in response to Alexandra's question about the marketing spend, where we're increasing it in certain of our businesses. And we're offsetting that with reductions elsewhere to be neutral from a margin perspective. So that's one piece of it. 
In terms of the headcount, we've actually dramatically slowed our hiring since the middle of this year. And we expect very few, if any, additional hires in 2022. Really only critical hires in growth businesses are the only additional headcount that we would add in 2022. 
And I think in 2023, the same philosophy will apply, meaning that for growing businesses and really critical hires, we'll make them. But other than that, we're going to be really judicious. So specifically, I'm expecting hiring in Hinge, which is a bright spot for us, a fast-growing business. But I'm not expecting meaningful headcount increases across the company. 
And to the extent that headcount does lead to incremental margin impact on the negative side, we would need to offset that with reductions in other parts of the business. And so when you think about where those could be, one is just general corporate overhead, things that are nice to have that we can do without or costs that have crept into the business over the last few years that we think we can reduce and pare back on without impacting the performance of the business. 
And there are some of those. And we've identified those and we're taking action on some of those. So you'll see the impact of that flow through the P&L, if not in the fourth quarter, then certainly as we make the turn into 2023. 
Also, in our real estate portfolio, obviously, post-COVID, things are not the same from a real estate perspective as they were pre-COVID. And to the extent it makes sense to adjust our real estate footprint, we're looking at doing so. 
So corporate overhead, corporate costs generally as well as real estate are places that we're targeting for reductions. And we can hopefully use some of that to reinvest in the businesses, in new growth initiatives, in marketing at Tinder and Hinge and so forth. And so that's part of our plan. 
And look, I would just say, we think these are the responsible things to do. There's a lot of macro headwinds out there that are very difficult to predict. And so we would rather be proactive on this front. And if the environment next year is not as bad as we are anticipating, then the business will improve from a profitability standpoint. 
So that's the approach that we're taking. And we're also mindful that the trajectory of certain of our businesses is growth challenged, and we also have to factor in that we need to be more disciplined on costs as a result of the growth challenges in some of our businesses. 
So I just want to kind of conclude by saying we have guiding principles around this. We're making targeted investments in businesses that we think can grow: Tinder, Hinge, The League, Chispa, BLK, some of these new apps that we might incubate. That is philosophically what we're trying to do, and we're making expense reductions in businesses where we have less confidence in the growth, primarily the Established Brands. 
So it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's not a complete broad-based approach. It is targeted investment in some parts of the businesses and reducing costs in corporate and other brands that aren't growing on the flip side. And that's how we're approaching the cost reductions that we're thinking about. 
And then the last thing I wanted to add before we just wrap the call up is that any investments we're going to make in new businesses next year, going forward are going to face a very high bar. Especially given the environment we're in, we need to apply a very disciplined lens to making any investments. 
And so we're reviewing everything very carefully, and we're going through our process now to do all of that. And so we'll have a lot more to communicate both on the cost and margin side, on the investment side as well as what we see as the environment from a macro perspective and revenue growth when we get together again in February on our next call. And I look forward to seeing you all then. BK, any last comments from you?"

I'm delighted to be on our second earnings call of the company. The time has flown by, and I attribute that to the team coming together making decisive calls and taking real action to accelerate momentum.
As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. When you exclude FX impact, we saw double-digit growth. There is still a lot of work to do. And while the macroeconomic environment is proving more challenging, we have a great team and an excellent portfolio of brands. That makes me optimistic that we can create significant long-term shareholder value.
After just a few months, the team at Tinder is gelling well together, and there has been a palpable change in the culture. We have made some big changes to improve organizational efficiencies and operations to get the team shipping product and accelerating growth. Some examples of this are bringing the revenue and product teams together so they're collaborating and supporting one another as one team in our shared mission. The marketing team is also working with and challenging the product teams to ensure that we're building features that users can get excited about.
Whenever reorganizations occur, there's always a risk of attrition. But with this new team in place, we haven't seen any. That's promising. We aren't dealing with massive disruption. Instead, we are getting more products into testing, working together to eventually return Tinder to previous growth levels. That won't happen overnight, but we are moving in the right direction.
I am excited about how our 2023 road map is beginning to take shape, which centers in 4 key areas: providing our women users more tailored experiences; targeting Gen Z through various product initiatives; evaluating virtual goods and coins to unlock untapped power users; and finally, creating more targeted monetization opportunities, including an expanded focus on users who have not previously paid.
Additionally, we have let the market tell the brand narrative about Tinder for too long. We recognize that a powerful Tinder narrative is a critical component to accelerating growth again. Going forward, we are working to activate levers across global marketing brand campaigns to bring to life the endless Tinder success stories over the past 10 years. The marketing team is working hand in hand with product to redefine the narrative for the next generation of singles. 
While it will take some time to see measurable changes overall, I fully believe in the team's ability to experiment, learn, build and ultimately deliver the best dating experiences for our users. Tinder has transformed the dating category over the last 10 years, and I am committed to making the next 10 even more exciting. 
Our search for a full-time CEO at Tinder is ongoing. We've met a broad set of talented and diverse leaders with a deep bench of consumer digital experience. I'm leading the charge on the search. But it's worth pointing out that we've already done a lot of the hard work that a new CEO typically has to do like establishing the leadership team, making the organization more nimble and increasing collaboration. It is critically important to me that this new leader can seamlessly move into the role and work with the current team with minimal disruption with a focus on growth and profitability. This is a role that I want to be very deliberate about. So in the meantime, I will remain interim CEO. The business plans are moving forward, and I'm expecting execution and performance will continue to improve over the next coming months.
Hinge continued to be a bright spot this quarter. They are delivering on their localization strategy to grow users and market share globally with a successful launch in Germany and reaching new markets throughout Europe. In October, Hinge hit record downloads in both the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., where Hinge has quickly become the third most popular dating app by downloads, the brand continues to innovate on the product experience. After the successful launch of audio prompts last year, the team was quick to roll out video prompts and prompt polls, giving daters more ways to express themselves and hopefully land a date.
Later this month, Hinge will start testing a new premium subscription tier. We have decided to hold back the full launch of the new tier until Q1, the peak season for dating. I'm really excited about how it's coming together, and I'm confident that it will resonate with the user base and provide an opportunity to drive RPP meaningfully higher.
As a company, we have achieved a lot in a short amount of time. We have worked diligently to right the ship at Tinder, pushed forward with our growth plans at Hinge and have continued to navigate the current challenging operating environment. At the same time, there is a significant amount of work to be done and innovations to be built that will further accelerate our growth. We are currently in the middle of our planning process for 2023 across the portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more during our next earnings call.
One thing I did want to call out as I spent more time with the business is we have different brands in different stages of growth. Given the current macro environment, we must focus our investment in brands that are growing and pull back in areas that are not driving growth. This has become a strategic imperative for us in 2023. I'll be able to share more on this strategy after we complete our strategic plans for next year.
Our world has never been more connected, and I'm so proud that we are continuing to deliver on our company's mission of connecting millions of people around the world in meaningful ways. As I've told everyone before, I'm passionate about people, culture and product, and look forward to improving the overall user experience across the portfolio with our talented group of technologists around the world.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
355279,1804513323,2671703,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, BK, and hello again, everyone. In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-",1631,"Thanks, BK, and hello again, everyone. In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact was $8 million worse than we expected when we provided our Q3 outlook on our August earnings call.
Our direct revenue also grew 1% year-over-year. It grew 5% year-over-year in the Americas with growth at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa but declines at the Established Brands. Direct revenue declined 1% year-over-year in Europe but was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder and Hinge. Direct revenue declined 5% in APAC and Other but was up 16% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder.
Total payers were 16.5 million, an increase of 2% from the prior year quarter. Payers were down 1% year-over-year in each of the Americas and Europe and up 12% in APAC and Other. Tinder payer additions grew stronger than we had expected while our Established Brands, including Match, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish saw year-over-year payer declines of over 15% in aggregate.
RPP was flat year-over-year at $16.02 in Q3. RPP was up 6% in the Americas, a 1 point sequential improvement, reflecting higher average rates for subscriptions and increased average à la carte purchases per payer at Tinder and Hinge.
RPP was flat year-over-year in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was down 14% in APAC and Other due to the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and the Turkish lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide again in Q3, up 16% in Europe and 4% in APAC and Other.
Tinder performed slightly above our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $460 million, up 6% year-over-year, 16% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 7% year-over-year, adding 700,000 payers to 11.1 million and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX.
Tinder RPP was up 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Recall that Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now facing that challenging comp.
All other brands direct revenue was down 5% year-over-year in Q3, driven by an 8% payer decline and 3% RPP growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continue to drive the growth. We continue to pull back on marketing spend for some of our Established Brands. And Plenty of Fish, in particular, continued to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions.
In Asia, Hyperconnect's Azar app revenue was down 7% year-over-year. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it was up more than 10% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen.
Hakuna continues to face challenges with revenue down low double digits year-over-year. Payers continue to be affected by market softness in Japan with only a slight year-over-year increase in revenue but down more than 15% as reported.
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, flat to Q2 but down 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $211 million in Q3 with margins of 26%. Adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at $284 million, representing a margin of 35%.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 3% year-over-year in Q3. Cost of revenue grew 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher app store fees, including the $8 million placed into the escrow for the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 31% of total revenue, up 2 points year-over-year.
Selling and marketing spend decreased $24 million or 16% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our more Established Brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Selling and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%.
G&A expense rose $11 million or 10% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 1 point from the prior year quarter. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees, but higher compensation and headcount expense as well as an increase in travel expenses of $4 million as we continue to return to a more normal cadence of business travel.
Product development costs grew 31% year-over-year and were 11% of revenue as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage was 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3.1x at the end of Q3.
We ended the quarter with $398 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed $267 million in the first month of Q3 to buy back 4.3 million of our shares at a VWAP of approximately $63 per share on a trade date basis. While the stock continued to decline significantly after we deployed our buyback, we believe our stock repurchase represents a sound long-term investment. We currently have 5.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization.
For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $780 million to $790 million. We anticipate nearly $70 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q4, meaning that total revenue growth would be nearly 9 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This headwind is $14 million more than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call.
We expect Tinder's Q4 direct revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year, up high single digits on an FX-neutral basis with mid-single-digit payers growth as ALC softness due to weak macroeconomic conditions impacts payers. We plan to adjust some of our merchandising tactics to help offset this. Historically, we've primarily offered large high-cost bundles of ALC features, for example, $30 bundles of Super Likes, which had been quite successful. In the current environment, we're adjusting our merchandising to emphasize smaller, lower-priced bundles to our users who see value in these ALC features, but are now more price-sensitive.
All other brands direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the Established Brands as well as at Pairs and Hyperconnect due to FX. We expect indirect revenue to be down about 20% year-over-year, given pressures we're seeing building in the ad sales market. We expect adjusted operating income of $270 million to $275 million in Q4, representing margins of about 35% at the midpoint of the ranges.
In Q4, we plan to increase marketing spend at Hinge, both in the U.S. where we see terrific momentum as well as in its international expansion markets as per its plan. We also expect to spend up slightly at Tinder and to launch a new brand marketing campaign at our Match brand.
Given lower spend at our other brands, we expect meaningfully lower year-over-year aggregate selling and marketing spend again in Q4. While visibility into 2023 is challenging, we're focused on delivering 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We believe Tinder is positioned to deliver a similar range of growth. This equates to total revenue up high single digits to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis as we expect FX to be about a 3-point drag in 2023.
We anticipate that the Emerging Brands such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK will deliver sufficient growth to offset the declines at the Established Brands. We expect Hinge to deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue in 2023. We expect the company as a whole to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023, driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder.
The 5% to 10% top line range reflects 3 key variables. One, quality of product execution and the timing/success initiatives at Tinder. If Tinder executes well, growth will be on the higher end of the range. Two, the strength of the contribution from international expansion and the new premium tier at Hinge. And three, macroeconomic impacts, particularly on lowering consumers and especially on à la carte purchases primarily at Tinder.
On the AOI side, we're still calibrating spend levels and the investments that we want to make in 2023. We expect incremental sales and marketing spend at Hinge to support its global user growth, including in its expansion across Europe. Despite the investment, we expect Hinge to maintain AOI margins of 30% plus. We expect to spend incremental marketing at Tinder to support its product enhancements and drive user growth. Even with that, we're confident Tinder can continue to achieve AOI margins in the 50% range.
We also intend to invest in The League, which we acquired earlier this year and believe has solid growth potential. We plan to invest in incubating a couple of new apps, which we're confident can better serve certain demographic groups than the existing offerings. To enable us to make the investments in our growth businesses, we plan to reduce operating expenses in other areas of the company to ensure that we can deliver at least flat year-over-year margins in 2023. This assumes no change to current app store policies.
We believe our business continues to achieve profitability and cash flow generation that has few parallels in consumer tech. We've always been conscious of delivering profitability and cash flow. But in the current operating environment, our focus on these items is being sharpened significantly. Our job for the coming year is to invest wisely in select growth opportunities and to manage costs judiciously elsewhere. And our team is up to the task.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And we're seeing strong subscriptions, and they remain very sticky. The main impact that we're seeing is from impulse and occasional buyers as they tend to be more price-sensitive, and they are impacted more by macroeconomic factors. As Gary pointed out, we've historically marketed our ALC products in large bundles, and that have led to significant purchases of these large bundles.
Therefore, we're moving quickly, and we're adjusting our ALC merchandising to emphasize smaller bundles to more price-sensitive customers. The customers that are most affected are younger users with less discretionary income, but we don't see a difference across geographies.
This is a reminder that conditions are ever changing. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we have to be nimble and be able to react to our consumers throughout the year. I am impressed by the speed at which the Tinder can diagnose and react to these type of effects. The Tinder team is actively working on mitigating this as much as possible, but I expect this is going to take some time and iteration."

I think when you look at our Q3, we provided a pretty conservative outlook for the quarter, in part because of all the disruption that was going on at Tinder. We weren't sure exactly how things were going to react to all the changes that we made. And so we wanted to be a little bit conservative in the Q3 outlook, and I think that led to the improvement versus expectations.
In Q4, though, we're seeing a pretty significant deterioration in trends. Even over the last few weeks, we think the macro environment has gotten much more challenging, and we're nervous about it for Q4 and going forward. And so as a result of that, our outlook for Q4 is perhaps lower than you would have thought because we think the caution is warranted, given the change in trends and the weakness in the overall macro environment, which, as BK just said, is really affecting Tinder on the à la carte side as users, especially younger users, have less discretionary income are being a little bit more cautious in their purchasing. And we think that effect is going to linger for a period of time. We are taking actions to offset that, and I think some of those will help offset the effects of it, but it is going to take some time for that to work its way through as well.
The other thing I would point out is that we have less product momentum going into Q4 than we typically have and certainly than we did last year when we had a very successful Q3 product adjustments that led to solid momentum in Q4. And remember, product work in the previous quarter or the previous 2 quarters gives us momentum into the next quarter. So we don't have the momentum we'd like to see or that we typically have leading into Q4, but it is building as the Tinder team makes more progress and influence new things. And so we think that, that momentum will build, and that gives us optimism that as the Tinder team continues to execute the way they need to execute, we'll start to see some improved momentum into 2023."

So to clarify, I always thought that virtual goods and currencies made sense in the Tinder ecosystem and is a big opportunity. But we want to do this right. And to do this, we have to build the virtual goods and then create the demand. After that, you can create the coin economy to purchase those goods. I asked the teams to rethink that road map and delay the launch into next year. They've been working on it. I'm excited because the Tinder CPO has great experience in building this type of economies. I'm really excited to see this roll out in 2023.
And then to your question about advertising, over the last 5 years, advertising has been a modest focus at Tinder, but the reality is over 85% of our users don't pay us anything. In my previous history, I've seen real success in monetizing users that don't pay. So I've asked the team to embrace advertising monetization culturally. I think there's a real opportunity to implement proven ideas from games that I've utilized in the past, for example, rewarded video. I think over time, I would like to see us get through $100 million in advertising revenue, which is about double the revenue that we have today. Thanks so much for the questions."

Our outlook as it relates to APAC businesses next year is a bit challenging just given all the moving parts, as you say. And so in Japan, what we've assumed is really no material change in the trends that we're seeing in the Japanese market next year. I'm hopeful we can do a little bit better than that and start to see some recovery, but we're not really seeing that yet. And so we've assumed that the conditions largely stay the same next year, which basically means we think that our Pairs business can achieve some modest improvement in revenue next year. But probably on a FX -- on a U.S. dollar basis, it's probably going to be down year-over-year. So modestly up in local currency, but down on a dollars basis.
And I think that business can probably achieve something in the neighborhood of 25% margin. So a reasonably profitable business, but the growth trajectory has really changed. And I'm hopeful that will change for the better, leading into the future.
Hyperconnect has a couple of moving parts as well. The Azar business is very encouraging as we showed in the letter and we've talked about. We feel good about that. And I think we will continue to see some reasonable level of growth from the Azar business.
Hyperconnect -- sorry, Hakuna at Hyperconnect is more challenged. And we're assuming a little bit of improvement in that business next year compared to this year, but not dramatically so. And so when you put that all together, I think that Hyperconnect overall will show some modest level of revenue growth next year in local currency. But again, when you -- FX affected, I think we will be down on a U.S. dollar basis. So that's what we're planning for. So there are some headwinds from a dollar perspective, both on the Japanese business at Pairs and on the Hyperconnect businesses.
I think Azar and Hakuna together can probably do about a 10% adjusted operating income margin. We're going to be disciplined on marketing spend and headcount there to try to drive improving margins. And we got to keep driving margins up in that business. And that is something that our new team there working with our existing CEO, Sam Ahn, is very focused on."

But to answer your question, it's still going to be below 10% of revenue.
With our new CMO, we see great opportunities to get brand message out there in a creative manner and market some of our newer product features that we have planned for next year. These 2 together should help accelerate user growth at Tinder. And even -- once again, and even with incremental marketing spend, we expect Tinder margin in 2023 to be in the 50% range as they always have been. Thanks for the question."

So maybe just a follow-up to the last question about marketing since BK, he liked the marketing questions. So if I understand it correctly, and this is a question about 2023, it seems like Tinder, Hinge and Match will see increase in marketing spend while all the other brands would be down. I guess the question is, is this a temporary strategy to weather the macro environment in 2023? Or do you see this more as a permanent pivot, permanent shift in your strategy going forward?
And maybe just a quick one. You guys talked about how Hinge should contribute at least an additional $100 million in 2023. What do you expect that business to contribute in 2022 just to have a base off to work off of?"
355279,1804513323,2671703,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on t",1141,"So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on the pound.
And so we had targeted $300 million. I think we'll probably fall about $15 million short of that. So let's call it, $285 million or so for the year. And then we said we think we can deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue next year, so that you can add that together.
Obviously, the $100 million depends really on the success of the international expansion, but more importantly, on the success and take rate around the new pricing tier, the new premium tier. And so that's really the thing that we don't know. We've made some reasonable estimates on what we think is going to happen with that tier. But we'll know a lot more in a few weeks or certainly by the end of the year as we're planning to start testing the middle of this month. And so by the end of this year, we'll have a much better sense. And so when we get back together again in February, we'll be able to give you some updates on that tier as well as on the overall outlook for Hinge revenue growth next year. So that was one piece of your question.
I did also just want to comment on the 2023 outlook just since you raised it, which is, by necessity, we wanted to provide an outlook for next year as we often do on this call. But this year, that is particularly challenging because there are so many moving pieces, both in our business and from a macro perspective. And so we don't really know what the macro environment is going to be through next year, what's going to happen from rates and recession and all the things that you know well. So we've tried to make our best guess at that.
But clearly, we'll have to see how things play out in the coming months to get a better sense of what 2023 looks like. But sitting here today, making our best guess on what economic conditions are going to be for next year, we're confident in that 5% to 10% growth for the overall company as well as at Tinder on the revenue side. So I just wanted to kind of mention some of that, so everyone understands how we've approached providing an outlook for next year at this point, given all the various crosswinds. 
And then on the last question about the marketing spend. You are right to assume that we're going to see marketing spend increases next year at Tinder for the reasons that BK explained about wanting to make sure we establish the brand narrative better than we have in the past as well as at Hinge, which we've talked about extensively. And that's really 2 things. One, to keep supporting its really strong and impressive user growth in the English-speaking markets, U.S., U.K. in particular, as well as continue to build around the world where there's a lot of momentum. Things are going well more than according to plan, and we feel great about our international expansion opportunity at Hinge. We want to keep investing in that. So those are the places where we are clearly investing meaningful dollars on the marketing side. 
I did want to correct, you said you thought there would be an increase in marketing spend at our Match brand next year. I don't think that's going to be the case. There is going to be an increase in our marketing spend at the Match brand in Q4 of this year, but that's because we have a discrete new brand campaign that we're launching. So there will be a year-over-year increase in Q4 of this year at Match, but we're not planning for that next year. In fact, we expect marketing spend at all of the Established Brands, including Match, to be down in 2023 over 2022. And we're using that to offset the investments we're making at the Hinge brand and at the Tinder brand. 
I would also say that our approach to marketing spend and how we're thinking about our strategy around that is not about weathering the current macroeconomic environment, and it's also not a permanent strategy. It's really a plan for targeted spend increases to achieve our strategic goals. So our strategic goals are at Hinge to grow the business internationally, and that's why we're investing. Our strategic goals at Tinder is to establish the brand narrative and take back some of the brand narrative and make some more noise in the market, and we're planning to do that with increased marketing spend next year. And then we'll sort of go from there. We're nimble in marketing spend, and we will continue to spend where we think it makes sense and pull back where we think it doesn't make sense. 
A couple of other areas I would point to, where we think we will spend up next year. One would be The League, which we recently acquired. And we think there's significant opportunity for growth of The League, and we plan to invest into that business on the marketing side. We're excited about the opportunities there. 
And then second is some new apps that we're thinking about incubating. We think there are some markets where the demographics are underserved. And we can build some apps that really satisfy those demographics better than the current offerings. To the extent we do that, user growth will be a priority, driving user growth, and marketing will be a component of that strategy in 2023 once we incubate the new app. So we expect to spend up to the extent we incubate some new apps, which is in our plan for 2023. 
And then I would just add that, philosophically, we're maintaining strict ROI discipline on our marketing spend as we always do, but especially in a tougher environment. And we believe that all of our brands, our marketing spend is meeting or exceeding our ROI threshold. So that is a lens we're going to continue to apply very, very carefully, especially in a challenging environment. We're hopeful that if the economy does soften, we will see some relief in terms of what has been an expensive and competitive marketing environment, but we have not seen that yet. 
I think it's logical to think it's coming, given all the headwinds in the economy. But if we do see that, we would look to capitalize on that as well. So hopefully, that answers the different parts of your questions, and I thank you for your questions."

I think we've made some reasonable assumptions based on what we're seeing for Q4 that give me confidence in our range that we provided for Q4. Obviously, I don't know how much things are going to deteriorate or not in 2023, and so that's what makes guiding for 2023 more challenging.

So you're right, and I said it before, we're investing marketing dollars in the business where we see growth opportunities, Tinder, Hinge, The League, et cetera. And we're offsetting those with reductions in the more Established Brands. 
The net result of that is that we expect marketing spend next year to be roughly consistent as a percentage of revenue with what we've seen in 2022. And so overall, our goal for next year is to have flat margins for the year, hopefully, do better than that, but that's our target. But you may see small fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, depending on the cadence of marketing spend. If we spend on a bigger campaign in Q1, that might have some effect on margins versus if we don't have that in Q2. So you might see margins be plus or minus a little bit year-over-year in each quarter, depending on the marketing spend cadence and what's going on from a campaign perspective. 
Outside of marketing spend, we're going to offset any incremental margin headwinds that exist with improvements elsewhere to hit that goal of at least flat margins. 
And then you're right, Tinder is a very high-margin asset for us, and we talked about that already. And so improvement in margins and ultimately hitting our long-term margin goal really is dependent on or at least it's the factor that Tinder really accelerate its growth and really contribute meaningful growth to us. So that is the #1 job for the company is to really accelerate Tinder growth and get it back to where it's been historically or at least closer to that, which will help us get closer to our overall long-term margin target.
The only other thing I'd point out around margins, and we mentioned this in the letter, is that our outlook for margins doesn't assume any relief from the app stores at all, which we think is the prudent thing to assume at the moment. That being said, the Digital Markets Act went into effect yesterday in the U.K., and we are expecting changes to app store policies as a result of that. And there's actions in other jurisdiction as well, markets like India, for example. And so we believe that it's likely that we're going to see relief from app stores in 2023, if not in 2024 at the latest. And so I do think there is upside to our margins as that plays through. But right now, our outlook doesn't contemplate any of that."

So when",836,"Sure. Let me take that one as well. When you look at our P&L, a lot of our costs come out of IFPs, which obviously we're nowhere near in control over as well as things like web hosting, AWS, things like that, which are difficult for us to affect. So when you look at what we can control, and we do want to control what we can control in the current environment, marketing and headcount as well as some other operating expense items are things that we really can control and can control costs on those fronts.
I just talked, in response to Alexandra's question, about the marketing spend where we're increasing it in certain of our businesses. And we're offsetting that with reductions elsewhere to be neutral from a margin perspective. So that's one piece of it. 
In terms of the headcount, we've actually dramatically slowed our hiring since the middle of this year, and we expect very few, if any, additional hires in 2022. Really, only critical hires in growth businesses are the only additional headcount that we would add in 2022. 
And I think in 2023, the same philosophy will apply, meaning that for growing businesses and really critical hires, we'll make them. But other than that, we're going to be really judicious. So specifically, I'm expecting hiring in Hinge, which is a bright spot for us, a fast-growing business. But I'm not expecting meaningful headcount increases elsewhere across the company.
And to the extent that headcount does lead to incremental margin impact on the negative side, we would need to offset that with reductions in other parts of the business. And so when you think about where those could be, one is just general corporate overhead, things that are nice to have that we can do without or costs that have crept into the business over the last few years that we think we can reduce and pare back on without impacting the performance of the business. And there are some of those. And we've identified those, and we're imminently taking action on some of those. So you'll see the impact of that flow through the P&L, if not in the fourth quarter, then certainly as we make the turn into 2023.
Also, in our real estate portfolio, obviously, post-COVID, things are not the same from a real estate perspective as they were pre-COVID. And to the extent it makes sense to adjust our real estate footprint, we're looking at doing so. So corporate overhead, corporate costs generally as well as real estate are places that we're targeting for reductions. And we can hopefully use some of that to reinvest in the businesses, in new growth initiatives, in marketing at Tinder and Hinge and so forth. And so that's part of our plan. 
And look, I would just say, we think these are the responsible things to do. There's a lot of macro headwinds out there that are very difficult to predict, and so we would rather be proactive on this front. And if the environment next year is not as bad as we are anticipating, then the business will improve from a profitability standpoint. So that's the approach that we're taking. And we're also mindful that the trajectory of certain of our businesses is growth challenged, and we also have to factor in that we need to be more disciplined on costs as a result of the growth challenges in some of our businesses. 
So I just want to kind of conclude by saying we have guiding principles around this. We're making targeted investments in businesses that we think can grow: Tinder, Hinge, The League, Chispa, BLK, some of these new apps that we might incubate. That is philosophically what we're trying to do, and we're making expense reductions in businesses where we have less confidence in the growth, primarily the Established Brands. So it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's not a complete broad-based approach. It is targeted investment in some parts of the businesses and reducing costs in corporate and other brands that aren't growing on the flip side. And that's how we're approaching the cost reductions that we're thinking about.
And then the last thing I wanted to add before we just wrap the call up is that any investments we're going to make in new businesses next year or going forward are going to face a very high bar. Especially given the environment we're in, we need to apply a very disciplined lens to making any investments. And so we're reviewing everything very carefully, and we're going through our process now to do all of that. And so we'll have a lot more to communicate both on the cost and margin side, on the investment side as well as what we see as the environment from a macro perspective and revenue growth when we get together again in February on our next call. And I look forward to seeing you all then. BK, any last comments from you?"

I'm delighted to be on our second earnings call of the company. The time has flown by, and I attribute that to the team coming together making decisive calls and taking real action to accelerate momentum.
As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. When you exclude FX impact, we saw double-digit growth. There is still a lot of work to do. And while the macroeconomic environment is proving more challenging, we have a great team and an excellent portfolio of brands. That makes me optimistic that we can create significant long-term shareholder value.
After just a few months, the team at Tinder is gelling well together and there has been a palpable change in the culture. We have made some big changes to improve organizational efficiencies and operations to get the team shipping product and accelerating growth. Some examples of this are bringing the revenue and product teams together so they're collaborating and supporting one another as one team in our shared mission. The marketing team is also working with and challenging the product teams to ensure that we're building features that users can get excited about.
Whenever reorganizations occur, there's always a risk of attrition. But with this new team in place, we haven't seen any. That's promising. We aren't dealing with massive disruption. Instead, we are getting more products into testing, working together to eventually return Tinder to previous growth levels. That won't happen overnight, but we are moving in the right direction.
I am excited about how our 2023 road map is beginning to take shape, which centers in 4 key areas: providing our women users more tailored experiences; targeting Gen Z through various product initiatives; evaluating virtual goods and coins to unlock untapped power users; and finally, creating more targeted monetization opportunities, including an expanded focus on users who have not previously paid.
Additionally, we have let the market tell the brand narrative about Tinder for too long. We recognize that a powerful Tinder narrative is a critical component to accelerating growth again. Going forward, we are working to activate levers across global marketing brand campaigns to bring to life the endless Tinder success stories over the past 10 years. The marketing team is working hand in hand with product to redefine the narrative for the next generation of singles.
While it will take some time to see measurable changes overall, I fully believe in the team's ability to experiment, learn, build and ultimately deliver the best dating experiences for our users. Tinder has transformed the dating category over the last 10 years, and I am committed to making the next 10 even more exciting.
Our search for a full-time CEO at Tinder is ongoing. We've met a broad set of talented and diverse leaders with a deep bench of consumer digital experience. I'm leading the charge on the search. But it's worth pointing out that we've already done a lot of the hard work that a new CEO typically has to do like establishing the leadership team, making the organization more nimble and increasing collaboration. It is critically important to me that this new leader can seamlessly move into the role and work with the current team with minimal disruption with a focus on growth and profitability. This is a role that I want to be very deliberate about, so in the meantime, I will remain interim CEO. The business plans are moving forward, and I'm expecting execution and performance will continue to improve over the next coming months.
Hinge continued to be a bright spot this quarter. They are delivering on their localization strategy to grow users and market share globally with a successful launch in Germany and reaching new markets throughout Europe. In October, Hinge hit record downloads in both the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., where Hinge has quickly become the third most popular dating app by downloads, the brand continues to innovate on the product experience. After the successful launch of audio prompts last year, the team was quick to roll out video prompts and prompt polls, giving daters more ways to express themselves and hopefully land a date.
Later this month, Hinge will start testing a new premium subscription tier. We have decided to hold back the full launch of the new tier until Q1, the peak season for dating. I'm really excited about how it's coming together, and I'm confident that it will resonate with the user base and provide an opportunity to drive RPP meaningfully higher.
As a company, we have achieved a lot in a short amount of time. We have worked diligently to right the ship at Tinder, pushed forward with our growth plans at Hinge and have continued to navigate the current challenging operating environment. At the same time, there is a significant amount of work to be done and innovations to be built that will further accelerate our growth. We are currently in the middle of our planning process for 2023 across the portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more during our next earnings call.
One thing I did want to call out as I spent more time with the business is we have different brands in different stages of growth. Given the current macro environment, we must focus our investment in brands that are growing and pull back in areas that are not driving growth. This has become a strategic imperative for us in 2023. I'll be able to share more on this strategy after we complete our strategic plans for next year.
Our world has never been more connected, and I'm so proud that we are continuing to deliver on our company's mission of connecting millions of people around the world in meaningful ways. As I've told everyone before, I'm passionate about people, culture and product, and look forward to improving the overall user experience across the portfolio with our talented group of technologists around the world.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."

In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-",1633,"Thanks, BK, and hello again, everyone. In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact was $8 million worse than we expected when we provided our Q3 outlook on our August earnings call.
Our direct revenue also grew 1% year-over-year. It grew 5% year-over-year in the Americas with growth at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa but declines at the Established Brands. Direct revenue declined 1% year-over-year in Europe but was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder and Hinge. Direct revenue declined 5% in APAC and Other but was up 16% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder.
Total payers were 16.5 million, an increase of 2% from the prior year quarter. Payers were down 1% year-over-year in each of the Americas and Europe and up 12% in APAC and Other. Tinder payer additions came in stronger than we had expected while our Established Brands, including Match, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish saw year-over-year payer declines of over 15% in aggregate.
RPP was flat year-over-year at $16.02 in Q3. RPP was up 6% in the Americas, a 1 point sequential improvement, reflecting higher average rates for subscriptions and increased average à la carte purchases per payer at Tinder and Hinge.
RPP was flat year-over-year in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was down 14% in APAC and Other due to the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and the Turkish lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide again in Q3, up 16% in Europe and 4% in APAC and Other.
Tinder performed slightly above our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $460 million, up 6% year-over-year, 16% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 7% year-over-year, adding 700,000 payers to 11.1 million and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX.
Tinder RPP was up 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Recall that Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now facing that challenging comp.
All other brands direct revenue was down 5% year-over-year in Q3, driven by an 8% payer decline and 3% RPP growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continue to drive the growth. We continue to pull back on marketing spend for some of our Established Brands. And Plenty of Fish, in particular, continued to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions.
In Asia, Hyperconnect's Azar app revenue was down 7% year-over-year. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it was up more than 10% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen.
Hakuna continues to face challenges with revenue down low double digits year-over-year. Payers continue to be affected by market softness in Japan with only a slight year-over-year increase in revenue but down more than 15% as reported.
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, flat to Q2 but down 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $211 million in Q3 with margins of 26%. Adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at $284 million, representing a margin of 35%.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 3% year-over-year in Q3. Cost of revenue grew 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher app store fees, including the $8 million placed into the escrow for the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 31% of total revenue, up 2 points year-over-year.
Selling and marketing spend decreased $24 million or 16% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our more Established Brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Selling and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%.
G&A expense rose $11 million or 10% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 1 point from the prior year quarter. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees, but higher compensation and headcount expense as well as an increase in travel expenses of $4 million as we continue to return to a more normal cadence of business travel.
Product development costs grew 31% year-over-year and were 11% of revenue as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage was 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3.1x at the end of Q3.
We ended the quarter with $398 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed $267 million in the first month of Q3 to buy back 4.3 million of our shares at a VWAP of approximately $63 per share on a trade date basis. While the stock continued to decline significantly after we deployed our buyback, we believe our stock repurchase represents a sound long-term investment. We currently have 5.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization.
For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $780 million to $790 million. We anticipate nearly $70 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q4, meaning that total revenue growth would be nearly 9 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This FX headwind is $14 million more than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call.
We expect Tinder's Q4 direct revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year, up high single digits on an FX-neutral basis with mid-single-digit payers growth as ALC softness due to weak macroeconomic conditions impacts payers. We plan to adjust some of our merchandising tactics to help offset this. Historically, we've primarily offered large high-cost bundles of ALC features, for example, $30 bundles of Super Likes, which had been quite successful. In the current environment, we're adjusting our merchandising to emphasize smaller, lower-priced bundles to our users who see value in these ALC features but are now more price-sensitive.
All other brands direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the Established Brands as well as at Pairs and Hyperconnect due to FX. We expect indirect revenue to be down about 20% year-over-year, given pressures we're seeing building in the ad sales market. We expect adjusted operating income of $270 million to $275 million in Q4, representing margins of about 35% at the midpoint of the ranges.
In Q4, we plan to increase marketing spend at Hinge, both in the U.S. where we see terrific momentum as well as in its international expansion markets as per its plan. We also expect to spend up slightly at Tinder and to launch a new brand marketing campaign at our Match brand.
Given lower spend at our other brands, we expect meaningfully lower year-over-year aggregate selling and marketing spend again in Q4. While visibility into 2023 is challenging, we're focused on delivering 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We believe Tinder is positioned to deliver a similar range of growth. This equates to total revenue up high single digits to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis as we expect FX to be about a 3-point drag in 2023.
We anticipate that the Emerging Brands such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK will deliver sufficient growth to offset the declines at the Established Brands. We expect Hinge to deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue in 2023. We expect the company as a whole to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023, driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder.
The 5% to 10% top line range reflects 3 key variables. One, quality of product execution and the timing/success initiatives at Tinder. If Tinder executes well, growth will be on the higher end of the range. Two, the strength of the contribution from international expansion and the new premium tier at Hinge. And three, macroeconomic impacts, particularly on lowering consumers and especially on à la carte purchases primarily at Tinder.
On the AOI side, we're still calibrating spend levels and the investments that we want to make in 2023. We expect incremental sales and marketing spend at Hinge to support its global user growth, including in its expansion across Europe. Despite the investment, we expect Hinge to maintain AOI margins of 30% plus. We expect to spend incremental marketing at Tinder to support its product enhancements and drive user growth. Even with that, we're confident Tinder can continue to achieve AOI margins in the 50% range.
We also intend to invest in The League, which we acquired earlier this year and believe has solid growth potential. We plan to invest in incubating a couple of new apps, which we're confident can better serve certain demographic groups than the existing offerings. To enable us to make the investments in our growth businesses, we plan to reduce operating expenses in other areas of the company to ensure that we can deliver at least flat year-over-year margins in 2023. This assumes no change to current app store policies.
We believe our business continues to achieve profitability and cash flow generation that has few parallels in consumer tech. We've always been conscious of delivering profitability and cash flow. But in the current operating environment, our focus on these items is being sharpened significantly. Our job for the coming year is to invest wisely in select growth opportunities and to manage costs judiciously elsewhere. And our team is up to the task.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And we're seeing strong subscriptions and they remain very sticky. The main impact that we're seeing is from impulse and occasional buyers as they tend to be more price sensitive and they are impacted more by macroeconomic factors. As Gary pointed out, we've historically marketed our ALC products in large bundles, and that have led to significant purchases of these large bundles.
Therefore, we're moving quickly, and we're adjusting our ALC merchandising to emphasize smaller bundles to more price-sensitive customers. The customers that are most affected are younger users with less discretionary income, but we don't see a difference across geographies.
This is a reminder that conditions are ever changing. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we have to be nimble and be able to react to our consumers throughout the year. I am impressed by the speed at which the Tinder can diagnose and react to these type of effects. The Tinder team is actively working on mitigating this as much as possible, but I expect this is going to take some time and iteration."

I think when you look at our Q3, we provided a pretty conservative outlook for the quarter, in part because of all the disruption that was going on at Tinder. We weren't sure exactly how things were going to react to all the changes that we made. And so we wanted to be a little bit conservative in the Q3 outlook, and I think that led to the improvement versus expectations.
In Q4, though, we're seeing a pretty significant deterioration in trends. Even over the last few weeks, we think the macro environment has gotten much more challenging and we're nervous about it for Q4 and going forward. And so as a result of that, our outlook for Q4 is perhaps lower than you would have thought because we think the caution is warranted, given the change in trends and the weakness in the overall macro environment, which, as BK just said, is really affecting Tinder on the à la carte side as users, especially younger users, have less discretionary income, are being a little bit more cautious in their purchasing. And we think that effect is going to linger for a period of time. We are taking actions to offset that, and I think some of those will help offset the effects of it, but it is going to take some time for that to work its way through as well.
The other thing I would point out is that we have less product momentum going into Q4 than we typically have and certainly than we did last year when we had a very successful Q3 product adjustments that led to solid momentum in Q4. And remember, product work in the previous quarter or the previous 2 quarters gives us momentum into the next quarter. So we don't have the momentum we'd like to see or that we typically have leading into Q4, but it is building as the Tinder team makes more progress and influence new things. And so we think that, that momentum will build, and that gives us optimism that as the Tinder team continues to execute the way they need to execute, we'll start to see some improved momentum into 2023."

So to clarify, I always thought that virtual goods and currencies made sense in the Tinder ecosystem and is a big opportunity. But we want to do this right. And to do this, we have to build the virtual goods and then create the demand. After that, you can create the coin economy to purchase those goods. I asked the teams to rethink that road map and delay the launch into next year. They've been working on it. I'm excited because the Tinder CPO has great experience in building these type of economies. I'm really excited to see this roll out in 2023.
And then to your question about advertising, over the last 5 years, advertising has been a modest focus at Tinder, but the reality is over 85% of our users don't pay us anything. In my previous history, I've seen real success in monetizing users that don't pay. So I've asked the team to embrace advertising monetization culturally. I think there's a real opportunity to implement proven ideas from games that I've utilized in the past, for example, rewarded video. I think over time, I would like to see us get through $100 million in advertising revenue, which is about double the revenue that we have today. Thanks so much for the questions."

Our outlook as it relates to APAC businesses next year is a bit challenging just given all the moving parts, as you say. And so in Japan, what we've assumed is really no material change in the trends that we're seeing in the Japanese market next year. I'm hopeful we can do a little bit better than that and start to see some recovery, but we're not really seeing that yet. And so we've assumed that the conditions largely stay the same next year, which basically means we think that our Pairs business can achieve some modest improvement in revenue next year. But probably on a FX -- on a U.S. dollar basis, it's probably going to be down year-over-year. So modestly up in local currency, but down on a dollars basis.
And I think that business can probably achieve something in the neighborhood of 25% margin. So a reasonably profitable business, but the growth trajectory has really changed. And I'm hopeful that will change for the better, leading into the future.
Hyperconnect has a couple of moving parts as well. The Azar business is very encouraging as we showed in the letter and we've talked about. We feel good about that. And I think we will continue to see some reasonable level of growth from the Azar business.
Hyperconnect -- sorry, Hakuna at Hyperconnect is more challenged. And we're assuming a little bit of improvement in that business next year compared to this year, but not dramatically so. And so when you put that all together, I think that Hyperconnect overall will show some modest level of revenue growth next year in local currency. But again, when you -- FX affected, I think we will be down on a U.S. dollar basis. So that's what we're planning for. So there are some headwinds from a dollar perspective, both on the Japanese business at Pairs and on the Hyperconnect businesses.
I think Azar and Hakuna together can probably do about a 10% adjusted operating income margin. We're going to be disciplined on marketing spend and headcount there to try to drive improving margins. And we got to keep driving margins up in that business. And that is something that our new team there working with our existing CEO, Sam Ahn, is very focused on."

We love the questions around marketing. So traditionally, Tinder has not spent much on marketing. They've always spent about less than 10% of revenue, and we don't see that changing. Thankfully, Tinder is not reliant on marketing to grow the business. However, this is a 10-year-old brand. And especially with younger users who are new to the category, we haven't taken the opportunity to establish our narrative. I believe that Tinder, which is a category leader, has been too quiet in the market for too long. In 2023, we're going to increase marketing spend to establish stronger brand narrative. But to answer your question, it's still going to be below 10% of revenue.
With our new CMO, we see great opportunities to get brand message out there in a creative manner and market some of our newer product features that we have planned for next year. These 2 together should help accelerate user growth at Tinder. And even -- once again, and even with incremental marketing spend, we expect Tinder margins in 2023 to be in the 50% range as they always have been. Thanks for the question."

So maybe just a follow-up to the last question about marketing since BK, he liked the marketing questions. So if I understand it correctly, and this is a question about 2023, it seems like Tinder, Hinge and Match will see increase in marketing spend while all the other brands would be down. I guess the question is, is this a temporary strategy to weather the macro environment in 2023? Or do you see this more as a permanent pivot, permanent shift in your strategy going forward?
And maybe just a quick one. You guys talked about how Hinge should contribute at least an additional $100 million in 2023. What do you expect that business to contribute in 2022 just to have a base off to work off of?"
355279,1804513323,2699063,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX.

I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on the pound.
And so we had targeted $300 million. I think we'll probably fall about $15 million short of that. So let's call it, $285 million or so for the year. And then we said we think we can deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue next year, so that you can add that together.
Obviously, the $100 million depends really on the success of the international expansion, but more importantly, on the success and take rate around the new pricing tier, the new premium tier. And so that's really the thing that we don't know. We've made some reasonable estimates on what we think is going to happen with that tier. But we'll know a lot more in a few weeks or certainly by the end of the year as we're planning to start testing the middle of this month. And so by the end of this year, we'll have a much better sense. And so when we get back together again in February, we'll be able to give you some updates on that tier as well as on the overall outlook for Hinge revenue growth next year. So that was one piece of your question.
I did also just want to comment on the 2023 outlook just since you raised it, which is, by necessity, we wanted to provide an outlook for next year as we often do on this call. But this year, that is particularly challenging because there are so many moving pieces, both in our business and from a macro perspective. And so we don't really know what the macro environment is going to be through next year, what's going to happen from rates and recession and all the things that you know well. So we've tried to make our best guess at that.
But clearly, we'll have to see how things play out in the coming months to get a better sense of what 2023 looks like. But sitting here today, making our best guess on what economic conditions are going to be for next year, we're confident in that 5% to 10% growth for the overall company as well as at Tinder on the revenue side. So I just wanted to kind of mention some of that, so everyone understands how we've approached providing an outlook for next year at this point, given all the various crosswinds.
And then on the last question about the marketing spend. You are right to assume that we're going to see marketing spend increases next year at Tinder for the reasons that BK explained about wanting to make sure we establish the brand narrative better than we have in the past as well as at Hinge, which we've talked about extensively. And that's really 2 things. One, to keep supporting its really strong and impressive user growth in the English-speaking markets, U.S., U.K. in particular, as well as continue to build around the world where there's a lot of momentum, things are going well more than according to plan and we feel great about our international expansion opportunity at Hinge. We want to keep investing in that. So those are the places where we are clearly investing meaningful dollars on the marketing side. 
I did want to correct, you said you thought there would be an increase in marketing spend at our Match brand next year. I don't think that's going to be the case. There is going to be an increase in our marketing spend at the Match brand in Q4 of this year, but that's because we have a discrete new brand campaign that we're launching. So there will be a year-over-year increase in Q4 of this year at Match, but we're not planning for that next year. In fact, we expect marketing spend at all of the Established Brands, including Match, to be down in 2023 over 2022. And we're using that to offset the investments we're making at the Hinge brand and at the Tinder brand.
I would also say that our approach to marketing spend and how we're thinking about our strategy around that is not about weathering the current macroeconomic environment, and it's also not a permanent strategy. It's really a plan for targeted spend increases to achieve our strategic goals. So our strategic goals are at Hinge to grow the business internationally, and that's why we're investing. Our strategic goals at Tinder is to establish the brand narrative and take back some of the brand narrative and make some more noise in the market, and we're planning to do that with increased marketing spend next year. And then we'll sort of go from there. We're nimble in marketing spend, and we will continue to spend where we think it makes sense and pull back where we think it doesn't make sense.
A couple of other areas I would point to, where we think we will spend up next year. One would be The League, which we recently acquired. And we think there's significant opportunity for growth of The League, and we plan to invest into that business on the marketing side. We're excited about the opportunities there.
And then second is some new apps that we're thinking about incubating. We think there are some markets where the demographics are underserved and we can build some apps that really satisfy those demographics better than the current offerings. To the extent we do that, user growth will be a priority, driving user growth, and marketing will be a component of that strategy in 2023 once we incubate the new app. So we expect to spend up to the extent we incubate some new apps, which is in our plan for 2023.
And then I would just add that, philosophically, we're maintaining strict ROI discipline on our marketing spend as we always do, but especially in a tougher environment. And we believe that all of our brands, our marketing spend is meeting or exceeding our ROI threshold. So that is a lens we're going to continue to apply very, very carefully, especially in a challenging environment. We're hopeful that if the economy does soften, we will see some relief in terms of what has been an expensive and competitive marketing environment, but we have not seen that yet.
I think it's logical to think it's coming, given all the headwinds in the economy. But if we do see that, we would look to capitalize on that as well. So hopefully, that answers the different parts of your questions, and I thank you for your questions."

I think we've made some reasonable assumptions based on what we're seeing for Q4 that give me confidence in our range that we provided for Q4. Obviously, I don't know how much things are going to deteriorate or not in 2023, and so that's what makes guiding for 2023 more challenging.

So you're right, and I said it before, we're investing marketing dollars in the business where we see growth opportunities, Tinder, Hinge, The League, et cetera. And we're offsetting those with reductions in the more Established Brands.
The net result of that is that we expect marketing spend next year to be roughly consistent as a percentage of revenue with what we've seen in 2022. And so overall, our goal for next year is to have flat margins for the year, hopefully, do better than that, but that's our target. But you may see small fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, depending on the cadence of marketing spend. If we spend on a bigger campaign in Q1, that might have some effect on margins versus if we don't have that in Q2. So you might see margins be plus or minus a little bit year-over-year in each quarter, depending on the marketing spend cadence and what's going on from a campaign perspective.
Outside of marketing spend, we're going to offset any incremental margin headwinds that exist with improvements elsewhere to hit that goal of at least flat margins.
And then you're right, Tinder is a very high-margin asset for us, and we talked about that already. And so improvement in margins and ultimately hitting our long-term margin goal really is dependent on or at least it's the factor that Tinder really accelerate its growth and really contribute meaningful growth to us. So that is the #1 job for the company is to really accelerate Tinder growth and get it back to where it's been historically or at least closer to that, which will help us get closer to our overall long-term margin target.
The only other thing I'd point out around margins, and we mentioned this in the letter, is that our outlook for margins doesn't assume any relief from the app stores at all, which we think is the prudent thing to assume at the moment. That being said, the Digital Markets Act went into effect yesterday in the U.K., and we are expecting changes to app store policies as a result of that. And there's actions in other jurisdiction as well, markets like India, for example. And so we believe that it's likely that we're going to see relief from app stores in 2023, if not in 2024 at the latest. And so I do think there is upside to our margins as that plays through. But right now, our outlook doesn't contemplate any of that."

So when",836,"Sure. Let me take that one as well. When you look at our P&L, a lot of our costs come out of IFPs, which obviously we're nowhere near in control over as well as things like web hosting, AWS, things like that, which are difficult for us to affect. So when you look at what we can control, and we do want to control what we can control in the current environment, marketing and headcount as well as some other operating expense items are things that we really can control and can control costs on those fronts.
I just talked, in response to Alexandra's question, about the marketing spend where we're increasing it in certain of our businesses. And we're offsetting that with reductions elsewhere to be neutral from a margin perspective. So that's one piece of it. 
In terms of the headcount, we've actually dramatically slowed our hiring since the middle of this year, and we expect very few, if any, additional hires in 2022. Really, only critical hires in growth businesses are the only additional headcount that we would add in 2022. 
And I think in 2023, the same philosophy will apply, meaning that for growing businesses and really critical hires, we'll make them. But other than that, we're going to be really judicious. So specifically, I'm expecting hiring in Hinge, which is a bright spot for us, a fast-growing business. But I'm not expecting meaningful headcount increases elsewhere across the company.
And to the extent that headcount does lead to incremental margin impact on the negative side, we would need to offset that with reductions in other parts of the business. And so when you think about where those could be, one is just general corporate overhead, things that are nice to have that we can do without or costs that have crept into the business over the last few years that we think we can reduce and pare back on without impacting the performance of the business. And there are some of those. And we've identified those, and we're imminently taking action on some of those. So you'll see the impact of that flow through the P&L, if not in the fourth quarter, then certainly as we make the turn into 2023.
Also, in our real estate portfolio, obviously, post-COVID, things are not the same from a real estate perspective as they were pre-COVID. And to the extent it makes sense to adjust our real estate footprint, we're looking at doing so. So corporate overhead, corporate cost generally as well as real estate are places that we're targeting for reductions. And we can hopefully use some of that to reinvest in the businesses, in new growth initiatives, in marketing at Tinder and Hinge and so forth. And so that's part of our plan. 
And look, I would just say, we think these are the responsible things to do. There's a lot of macro headwinds out there that are very difficult to predict, and so we would rather be proactive on this front. And if the environment next year is not as bad as we are anticipating, then the business will improve from a profitability standpoint. So that's the approach that we're taking. And we're also mindful that the trajectory of certain of our businesses is growth challenged, and we also have to factor in that we need to be more disciplined on costs as a result of the growth challenges in some of our businesses. 
So I just want to kind of conclude by saying we have guiding principles around this. We're making targeted investments in businesses that we think can grow: Tinder, Hinge, The League, Chispa, BLK, some of these new apps that we might incubate. That is philosophically what we're trying to do, and we're making expense reductions in businesses where we have less confidence in the growth, primarily the Established Brands. So it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's not a complete broad-based approach. It is targeted investment in some parts of the businesses and reducing costs in corporate and other brands that aren't growing on the flip side. And that's how we're approaching the cost reductions that we're thinking about.
And then the last thing I wanted to add before we just wrap the call up is that any investments we're going to make in new businesses next year or going forward are going to face a very high bar. Especially given the environment we're in, we need to apply a very disciplined lens to making any investments. And so we're reviewing everything very carefully, and we're going through our process now to do all of that. And so we'll have a lot more to communicate both on the cost and margin side, on the investment side as well as what we see as the environment from a macro perspective and revenue growth when we get together again in February on our next call. And I look forward to seeing you all then. BK, any last comments from you?"

I'm delighted to be on our second earnings call of the company. The time has flown by, and I attribute that to the team coming together making decisive calls and taking real action to accelerate momentum.
As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. When you exclude FX impact, we saw double-digit growth. There is still a lot of work to do. And while the macroeconomic environment is proving more challenging, we have a great team and an excellent portfolio of brands that makes me optimistic that we can create significant long-term shareholder value.
After just a few months, the team at Tinder is gelling well together and there has been a palpable change in the culture. We have made some big changes to improve organizational efficiencies and operations to get the team shipping product and accelerating growth. Some examples of this are bringing the revenue and product teams together so they're collaborating and supporting one another as one team in our shared mission. The marketing team is also working with and challenging the product teams to ensure that we're building features that users can get excited about.
Whenever reorganizations occur, there's always a risk of attrition. But with this new team in place, we haven't seen any. That's promising. We aren't dealing with massive disruption. Instead, we are getting more products into testing, working together to eventually return Tinder to previous growth levels. That won't happen overnight, but we are moving in the right direction.
I am excited about how our 2023 road map is beginning to take shape, which centers in 4 key areas: providing our women users more tailored experiences; targeting Gen Z through various product initiatives; evaluating virtual goods and coins to unlock untapped power users; and finally, creating more targeted monetization opportunities, including an expanded focus on users who have not previously paid.
Additionally, we have let the market tell the brand narrative about Tinder for too long. We recognize that a powerful Tinder narrative is a critical component to accelerating growth again. Going forward, we are working to activate levers across global marketing brand campaigns to bring to life the endless Tinder success stories over the past 10 years. The marketing team is working hand in hand with product to redefine the narrative for the next generation of singles.
While it will take some time to see measurable changes overall, I fully believe in the team's ability to experiment, learn, build and ultimately deliver the best dating experiences for our users. Tinder has transformed the dating category over the last 10 years, and I am committed to making the next 10 even more exciting.
Our search for a full-time CEO at Tinder is ongoing. We've met a broad set of talented and diverse leaders with a deep bench of consumer digital experience. I'm leading the charge on the search. But it's worth pointing out that we've already done a lot of the hard work that a new CEO typically has to do like establishing the leadership team, making the organization more nimble and increasing collaboration. It is critically important to me that this new leader can seamlessly move into the role and work with the current team with minimal disruption with a focus on growth and profitability. This is a role that I want to be very deliberate about, so in the meantime, I will remain interim CEO. The business plans are moving forward, and I'm expecting execution and performance will continue to improve over the next coming months.
Hinge continued to be a bright spot this quarter. They are delivering on their localization strategy to grow users and market share globally with a successful launch in Germany and reaching new markets throughout Europe. In October, Hinge hit record downloads in both the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., where Hinge has quickly become the third most popular dating app by downloads, the brand continues to innovate on the product experience. After the successful launch of audio prompts last year, the team was quick to roll out video prompts and prompt polls, giving daters more ways to express themselves and hopefully land a date.
Later this month, Hinge will start testing a new premium subscription tier. We have decided to hold back the full launch of the new tier until Q1, the peak season for dating. I'm really excited about how it's coming together, and I'm confident that it will resonate with the user base and provide an opportunity to drive RPP meaningfully higher.
As a company, we have achieved a lot in a short amount of time. We have worked diligently to right the ship at Tinder, pushed forward with our growth plans at Hinge and have continued to navigate the current challenging operating environment. At the same time, there is a significant amount of work to be done and innovations to be built that will further accelerate our growth. We are currently in the middle of our planning process for 2023 across the portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more during our next earnings call.
One thing I did want to call out as I spent more time with the business is we have different brands in different stages of growth. Given the current macro environment, we must focus our investment in brands that are growing and pull back in areas that are not driving growth. This has become a strategic imperative for us in 2023. I'll be able to share more on this strategy after we complete our strategic plans for next year.
Our world has never been more connected, and I'm so proud that we are continuing to deliver on our company's mission of connecting millions of people around the world in meaningful ways. As I've told everyone before, I'm passionate about people, culture and product, and look forward to improving the overall user experience across the portfolio with our talented group of technologists around the world.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."

In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-",1633,"Thanks, BK, and hello again, everyone. In a tough environment, we had a solid Q3 with total revenue of $810 million, up 1% year-over-year. The FX headwinds were severe once again as our revenue would have been $883 million, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The FX impact was $8 million worse than we expected when we provided our Q3 outlook on our August earnings call.
Our direct revenue also grew 1% year-over-year. It grew 5% year-over-year in the Americas with growth at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa but declines at the Established Brands. Direct revenue declined 1% year-over-year in Europe but was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder and Hinge. Direct revenue declined 5% in APAC and Other but was up 16% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder.
Total payers were 16.5 million, an increase of 2% from the prior year quarter. Payers were down 1% year-over-year in each of the Americas and Europe and up 12% in APAC and Other. Tinder payer additions came in stronger than we had expected while our Established Brands, including Match, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish saw year-over-year payer declines of over 15% in aggregate.
RPP was flat year-over-year at $16.02 in Q3. RPP was up 6% in the Americas, a 1 point sequential improvement, reflecting higher average rates for subscriptions and increased average à la carte purchases per payer at Tinder and Hinge.
RPP was flat year-over-year in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hyperconnect were offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was down 14% in APAC and Other due to the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and the Turkish lira. On an FX-neutral basis, RPP was up 9% company-wide again in Q3, up 16% in Europe and 4% in APAC and Other.
Tinder performed slightly above our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $460 million, up 6% year-over-year, 16% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder had payers growth of 7% year-over-year, adding 700,000 payers to 11.1 million and a 1% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again shows the impact of FX.
Tinder RPP was up 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Recall that Tinder made several beneficial paywall and other optimizations in Q3 '21, which drove record sequential payer additions and strong revenue in that quarter. We're now facing that challenging comp.
All other brands direct revenue was down 5% year-over-year in Q3, driven by an 8% payer decline and 3% RPP growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continue to drive the growth. We continue to pull back on marketing spend for some of our Established Brands. And Plenty of Fish, in particular, continued to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions.
In Asia, Hyperconnect's Azar app revenue was down 7% year-over-year. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it was up more than 10% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira and the Japanese yen.
Hakuna continues to face challenges with revenue down low double digits year-over-year. Payers continue to be affected by market softness in Japan with only a slight year-over-year increase in revenue but down more than 15% as reported.
Indirect revenue was $14 million in the quarter, flat to Q2 but down 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $211 million in Q3 with margins of 26%. Adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at $284 million, representing a margin of 35%.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 3% year-over-year in Q3. Cost of revenue grew 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher app store fees, including the $8 million placed into the escrow for the Google litigation. Cost of revenue represented 31% of total revenue, up 2 points year-over-year.
Selling and marketing spend decreased $24 million or 16% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our more Established Brands and to show ROI discipline overall. Selling and marketing spend was down 3 points year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%.
G&A expense rose $11 million or 10% year-over-year. G&A comprised 14% of revenue, up 1 point from the prior year quarter. The increase in G&A expense reflects lower legal fees, but higher compensation and headcount expense as well as an increase in travel expenses of $4 million as we continue to return to a more normal cadence of business travel.
Product development costs grew 31% year-over-year and were 11% of revenue as we increased headcount, particularly at Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage was 3.5x trailing adjusted operating income, and our net leverage was 3.1x at the end of Q3.
We ended the quarter with $398 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We deployed $267 million in the first month of Q3 to buy back 4.3 million of our shares at a VWAP of approximately $63 per share on a trade date basis. While the stock continued to decline significantly after we deployed our buyback, we believe our stock repurchase represents a sound long-term investment. We currently have 5.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization.
For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $780 million to $790 million. We anticipate nearly $70 million of year-over-year FX headwinds in Q4, meaning that total revenue growth would be nearly 9 points higher on an FX-neutral basis. This FX headwind is $14 million more than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call.
We expect Tinder's Q4 direct revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year, up high single digits on an FX-neutral basis with mid-single-digit payers growth as ALC softness due to weak macroeconomic conditions impacts payers. We plan to adjust some of our merchandising tactics to help offset this. Historically, we've primarily offered large high-cost bundles of ALC features, for example, $30 bundles of Super Likes, which had been quite successful. In the current environment, we're adjusting our merchandising to emphasize smaller, lower-priced bundles to our users who see value in these ALC features but are now more price-sensitive.
All other brands direct revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, but up low single digits on an FX-neutral basis. We expect Hinge, BLK and Chispa will continue to drive the growth, helping offset declines at the Established Brands as well as at Pairs and Hyperconnect due to FX. We expect indirect revenue to be down about 20% year-over-year, given pressures we're seeing building in the ad sales market. We expect adjusted operating income of $270 million to $275 million in Q4, representing margins of about 35% at the midpoint of the ranges.
In Q4, we plan to increase marketing spend at Hinge, both in the U.S. where we see terrific momentum as well as in its international expansion markets as per its plan. We also expect to spend up slightly at Tinder and to launch a new brand marketing campaign at our Match brand.
Given lower spend at our other brands, we expect meaningfully lower year-over-year aggregate selling and marketing spend again in Q4. While visibility into 2023 is challenging, we're focused on delivering 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We believe Tinder is positioned to deliver a similar range of growth. This equates to total revenue up high single digits to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis as we expect FX to be about a 3-point drag in 2023.
We anticipate that the Emerging Brands such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK will deliver sufficient growth to offset the declines at the Established Brands. We expect Hinge to deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue in 2023. We expect the company as a whole to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023, driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder.
The 5% to 10% top line range reflects 3 key variables. One, quality of product execution and the timing/success initiatives at Tinder. If Tinder executes well, growth will be on the higher end of the range. Two, the strength of the contribution from international expansion and the new premium tier at Hinge. And three, macroeconomic impacts, particularly on lowering consumers and especially on à la carte purchases primarily at Tinder.
On the AOI side, we're still calibrating spend levels and the investments that we want to make in 2023. We expect incremental sales and marketing spend at Hinge to support its global user growth, including in its expansion across Europe. Despite the investment, we expect Hinge to maintain AOI margins of 30% plus. We expect to spend incremental marketing at Tinder to support its product enhancements and drive user growth. Even with that, we're confident Tinder can continue to achieve AOI margins in the 50% range.
We also intend to invest in The League, which we acquired earlier this year and believe has solid growth potential. We plan to invest in incubating a couple of new apps, which we're confident can better serve certain demographic groups than the existing offerings. To enable us to make the investments in our growth businesses, we plan to reduce operating expenses in other areas of the company to ensure that we can deliver at least flat year-over-year margins in 2023. This assumes no change to current app store policies.
We believe our business continues to achieve profitability and cash flow generation that has few parallels in consumer tech. We've always been conscious of delivering profitability and cash flow. But in the current operating environment, our focus on these items is being sharpened significantly. Our job for the coming year is to invest wisely in select growth opportunities and to manage costs judiciously elsewhere. And our team is up to the task.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And we're seeing strong subscriptions and they remain very sticky. The main impact that we're seeing is from impulse and occasional buyers as they tend to be more price sensitive and they are impacted more by macroeconomic factors. As Gary pointed out, we've historically marketed our ALC products in large bundles, and that have led to significant purchases of these large bundles.
Therefore, we're moving quickly, and we're adjusting our ALC merchandising to emphasize smaller bundles to more price-sensitive customers. The customers that are most affected are younger users with less discretionary income, but we don't see a difference across geographies.
This is a reminder that conditions are ever changing. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we have to be nimble and be able to react to our consumers throughout the year. I am impressed by the speed at which the Tinder can diagnose and react to these type of effects. The Tinder team is actively working on mitigating this as much as possible, but I expect this is going to take some time and iteration."

I think when you look at our Q3, we provided a pretty conservative outlook for the quarter, in part because of all the disruption that was going on at Tinder. We weren't sure exactly how things were going to react to all the changes that we made. And so we wanted to be a little bit conservative in the Q3 outlook, and I think that led to the improvement versus expectations.
In Q4, though, we're seeing a pretty significant deterioration in trends. Even over the last few weeks, we think the macro environment has gotten much more challenging and we're nervous about it for Q4 and going forward. And so as a result of that, our outlook for Q4 is perhaps lower than you would have thought because we think the caution is warranted, given the change in trends and the weakness in the overall macro environment, which, as BK just said, is really affecting Tinder on the à la carte side as users, especially younger users, have less discretionary income, are being a little bit more cautious in their purchasing. And we think that effect is going to linger for a period of time. We are taking actions to offset that, and I think some of those will help offset the effects of it, but it is going to take some time for that to work its way through as well.
The other thing I would point out is that we have less product momentum going into Q4 than we typically have and certainly than we did last year when we had a very successful Q3 product adjustments that led to solid momentum in Q4. And remember, product work in the previous quarter or the previous 2 quarters gives us momentum into the next quarter. So we don't have the momentum we'd like to see or that we typically have leading into Q4, but it is building as the Tinder team makes more progress and influence new things. And so we think that, that momentum will build, and that gives us optimism that as the Tinder team continues to execute the way they need to execute, we'll start to see some improved momentum into 2023."

So to clarify, I always thought that virtual goods and currencies made sense in the Tinder ecosystem and is a big opportunity. But we want to do this right. And to do this, we have to build the virtual goods and then create the demand. After that, you can create the coin economy to purchase those goods. I asked the teams to rethink that road map and delay the launch into next year. They've been working on it. I'm excited because the Tinder CPO has great experience in building these type of economies. I'm really excited to see this roll out in 2023.
And then to your question about advertising, over the last 5 years, advertising has been a modest focus at Tinder, but the reality is over 85% of our users don't pay us anything. In my previous history, I've seen real success in monetizing users that don't pay. So I've asked the team to embrace advertising monetization culturally. I think there's a real opportunity to implement proven ideas from games that I've utilized in the past, for example, rewarded video. I think over time, I would like to see us get through $100 million in advertising revenue, which is about double the revenue that we have today. Thanks so much for the questions."

Our outlook as it relates to APAC businesses next year is a bit challenging just given all the moving parts, as you say. And so in Japan, what we've assumed is really no material change in the trends that we're seeing in the Japanese market next year. I'm hopeful we can do a little bit better than that and start to see some recovery, but we're not really seeing that yet. And so we've assumed that the conditions largely stay the same next year, which basically means we think that our Pairs business can achieve some modest improvement in revenue next year. But probably on a FX -- on a U.S. dollar basis, it's probably going to be down year-over-year. So modestly up in local currency, but down on a dollars basis.
And I think that business can probably achieve something in the neighborhood of 25% margin. So a reasonably profitable business, but the growth trajectory has really changed. And I'm hopeful that will change for the better, leading into the future.
Hyperconnect has a couple of moving parts as well. The Azar business is very encouraging as we showed in the letter and we've talked about. We feel good about that. And I think we will continue to see some reasonable level of growth from the Azar business.
Hyperconnect -- sorry, Hakuna at Hyperconnect is more challenged. And we're assuming a little bit of improvement in that business next year compared to this year, but not dramatically so. And so when you put that all together, I think that Hyperconnect overall will show some modest level of revenue growth next year in local currency. But again, when you -- FX affected, I think we will be down on a U.S. dollar basis. So that's what we're planning for. So there are some headwinds from a dollar perspective, both on the Japanese business at Pairs and on the Hyperconnect businesses.
I think Azar and Hakuna together can probably do about a 10% adjusted operating income margin. We're going to be disciplined on marketing spend and headcount there to try to drive improving margins. And we got to keep driving margins up in that business. And that is something that our new team there working with our existing CEO, Sam Ahn, is very focused on."

We love the questions around marketing. So traditionally, Tinder has not spent much on marketing. They've always spent about less than 10% of revenue, and we don't see that changing. Thankfully, Tinder is not reliant on marketing to grow the business. However, this is a 10-year-old brand. And especially with younger users who are new to the category, we haven't taken the opportunity to establish our narrative. I believe that Tinder, which is a category leader, has been too quiet in the market for too long. In 2023, we're going to increase marketing spend to establish stronger brand narrative. But to answer your question, it's still going to be below 10% of revenue.
With our new CMO, we see great opportunities to get brand message out there in a creative manner and market some of our newer product features that we have planned for next year. These 2 together should help accelerate user growth at Tinder. And even -- once again, and even with incremental marketing spend, we expect Tinder margins in 2023 to be in the 50% range as they always have been. Thanks for the question."

So maybe just a follow-up to the last question about marketing since BK, he liked the marketing questions. So if I understand it correctly, and this is a question about 2023, it seems like Tinder, Hinge and Match will see increase in marketing spend while all the other brands would be down. I guess the question is, is this a temporary strategy to weather the macro environment in 2023? Or do you see this more as a permanent pivot, permanent shift in your strategy going forward?
And maybe just a quick one. You guys talked about how Hinge should contribute at least an additional $100 million in 2023. What do you expect that business to contribute in 2022 just to have a base off to work off of?"
355279,1804513323,2699125,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2022",2022-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","So let me take the Hinge question first. I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX.

I think BK mentioned that Hinge is probably about $15 million behind the goal for the year, mostly because of FX. It's got a big U.K. business in particular, and it's feeling the impact of FX, especially in -- on the pound.
And so we had targeted $300 million. I think we'll probably fall about $15 million short of that. So let's call it, $285 million or so for the year. And then we said we think we can deliver at least $100 million of incremental revenue next year, so that you can add that together.
Obviously, the $100 million depends really on the success of the international expansion, but more importantly, on the success and take rate around the new pricing tier, the new premium tier. And so that's really the thing that we don't know. We've made some reasonable estimates on what we think is going to happen with that tier. But we'll know a lot more in a few weeks or certainly by the end of the year as we're planning to start testing the middle of this month. And so by the end of this year, we'll have a much better sense. And so when we get back together again in February, we'll be able to give you some updates on that tier as well as on the overall outlook for Hinge revenue growth next year. So that was one piece of your question.
I did also just want to comment on the 2023 outlook just since you raised it, which is, by necessity, we wanted to provide an outlook for next year as we often do on this call. But this year, that is particularly challenging because there are so many moving pieces, both in our business and from a macro perspective. And so we don't really know what the macro environment is going to be through next year, what's going to happen from rates and recession and all the things that you know well. So we've tried to make our best guess at that.
But clearly, we'll have to see how things play out in the coming months to get a better sense of what 2023 looks like. But sitting here today, making our best guess on what economic conditions are going to be for next year, we're confident in that 5% to 10% growth for the overall company as well as at Tinder on the revenue side. So I just wanted to kind of mention some of that, so everyone understands how we've approached providing an outlook for next year at this point, given all the various crosswinds.
And then on the last question about the marketing spend. You are right to assume that we're going to see marketing spend increases next year at Tinder for the reasons that BK explained about wanting to make sure we establish the brand narrative better than we have in the past as well as at Hinge, which we've talked about extensively. And that's really 2 things. One, to keep supporting its really strong and impressive user growth in the English-speaking markets, U.S., U.K. in particular, as well as continue to build around the world where there's a lot of momentum, things are going well more than according to plan and we feel great about our international expansion opportunity at Hinge. We want to keep investing in that. So those are the places where we are clearly investing meaningful dollars on the marketing side. 
I did want to correct, you said you thought there would be an increase in marketing spend at our Match brand next year. I don't think that's going to be the case. There is going to be an increase in our marketing spend at the Match brand in Q4 of this year, but that's because we have a discrete new brand campaign that we're launching. So there will be a year-over-year increase in Q4 of this year at Match, but we're not planning for that next year. In fact, we expect marketing spend at all of the Established Brands, including Match, to be down in 2023 over 2022. And we're using that to offset the investments we're making at the Hinge brand and at the Tinder brand.
I would also say that our approach to marketing spend and how we're thinking about our strategy around that is not about weathering the current macroeconomic environment, and it's also not a permanent strategy. It's really a plan for targeted spend increases to achieve our strategic goals. So our strategic goals are at Hinge to grow the business internationally, and that's why we're investing. Our strategic goals at Tinder is to establish the brand narrative and take back some of the brand narrative and make some more noise in the market, and we're planning to do that with increased marketing spend next year. And then we'll sort of go from there. We're nimble in marketing spend, and we will continue to spend where we think it makes sense and pull back where we think it doesn't make sense.
A couple of other areas I would point to, where we think we will spend up next year. One would be The League, which we recently acquired. And we think there's significant opportunity for growth of The League, and we plan to invest into that business on the marketing side. We're excited about the opportunities there.
And then second is some new apps that we're thinking about incubating. We think there are some markets where the demographics are underserved and we can build some apps that really satisfy those demographics better than the current offerings. To the extent we do that, user growth will be a priority, driving user growth, and marketing will be a component of that strategy in 2023 once we incubate the new app. So we expect to spend up to the extent we incubate some new apps, which is in our plan for 2023.
And then I would just add that, philosophically, we're maintaining strict ROI discipline on our marketing spend as we always do, but especially in a tougher environment. And we believe that all of our brands, our marketing spend is meeting or exceeding our ROI threshold. So that is a lens we're going to continue to apply very, very carefully, especially in a challenging environment. We're hopeful that if the economy does soften, we will see some relief in terms of what has been an expensive and competitive marketing environment, but we have not seen that yet.
I think it's logical to think it's coming, given all the headwinds in the economy. But if we do see that, we would look to capitalize on that as well. So hopefully, that answers the different parts of your questions, and I thank you for your questions."

I think we've made some reasonable assumptions based on what we're seeing for Q4 that give me confidence in our range that we provided for Q4.

So you're right, and I said it before, we're investing marketing dollars in the business where we see growth opportunities, Tinder, Hinge, The League, et cetera. And we're offsetting those with reductions in the more Established Brands.
The net result of that is that we expect marketing spend next year to be roughly consistent as a percentage of revenue with what we've seen in 2022. And so overall, our goal for next year is to have flat margins for the year, hopefully, do better than that, but that's our target. But you may see small fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, depending on the cadence of marketing spend. If we spend on a bigger campaign in Q1, that might have some effect on margins versus if we don't have that in Q2. So you might see margins be plus or minus a little bit year-over-year in each quarter, depending on the marketing spend cadence and what's going on from a campaign perspective.
Outside of marketing spend, we're going to offset any incremental margin headwinds that exist with improvements elsewhere to hit that goal of at least flat margins.
And then you're right, Tinder is a very high-margin asset for us, and we talked about that already. And so improvement in margins and ultimately hitting our long-term margin goal really is dependent on or at least it's the factor that Tinder really accelerate its growth and really contribute meaningful growth to us. So that is the #1 job for the company is to really accelerate Tinder growth and get it back to where it's been historically or at least closer to that, which will help us get closer to our overall long-term margin target.
The only other thing I'd point out around margins, and we mentioned this in the letter, is that our outlook for margins doesn't assume any relief from the app stores at all, which we think is the prudent thing to assume at the moment. That being said, the Digital Markets Act went into effect yesterday in the U.K., and we are expecting changes to app store policies as a result of that. And there's actions in other jurisdiction as well, markets like India, for example. And so we believe that it's likely that we're going to see relief from app stores in 2023, if not in 2024 at the latest. And so I do think there is upside to our margins as that plays through. But right now, our outlook doesn't contemplate any of that."

When you look at our P&L, a lot of our costs come out of IFPs, which obviously we're nowhere near in control over as well as things like web hosting, AWS, things like that, which are difficult for us to affect. So when",836,"Sure. Let me take that one as well. When you look at our P&L, a lot of our costs come out of IFPs, which obviously we're nowhere near in control over as well as things like web hosting, AWS, things like that, which are difficult for us to affect. So when you look at what we can control, and we do want to control what we can control in the current environment, marketing and headcount as well as some other operating expense items are things that we really can control and can control costs on those fronts.
I just talked, in response to Alexandra's question, about the marketing spend where we're increasing it in certain of our businesses. And we're offsetting that with reductions elsewhere to be neutral from a margin perspective. So that's one piece of it. 
In terms of the headcount, we've actually dramatically slowed our hiring since the middle of this year, and we expect very few, if any, additional hires in 2022. Really, only critical hires in growth businesses are the only additional headcount that we would add in 2022. 
And I think in 2023, the same philosophy will apply, meaning that for growing businesses and really critical hires, we'll make them. But other than that, we're going to be really judicious. So specifically, I'm expecting hiring in Hinge, which is a bright spot for us, a fast-growing business. But I'm not expecting meaningful headcount increases elsewhere across the company.
And to the extent that headcount does lead to incremental margin impact on the negative side, we would need to offset that with reductions in other parts of the business. And so when you think about where those could be, one is just general corporate overhead, things that are nice to have that we can do without or costs that have crept into the business over the last few years that we think we can reduce and pare back on without impacting the performance of the business. And there are some of those. And we've identified those, and we're imminently taking action on some of those. So you'll see the impact of that flow through the P&L, if not in the fourth quarter, then certainly as we make the turn into 2023.
Also, in our real estate portfolio, obviously, post-COVID, things are not the same from a real estate perspective as they were pre-COVID. And to the extent it makes sense to adjust our real estate footprint, we're looking at doing so. So corporate overhead, corporate cost generally as well as real estate are places that we're targeting for reductions. And we can hopefully use some of that to reinvest in the businesses, in new growth initiatives, in marketing at Tinder and Hinge and so forth. And so that's part of our plan. 
And look, I would just say, we think these are the responsible things to do. There's a lot of macro headwinds out there that are very difficult to predict, and so we would rather be proactive on this front. And if the environment next year is not as bad as we are anticipating, then the business will improve from a profitability standpoint. So that's the approach that we're taking. And we're also mindful that the trajectory of certain of our businesses is growth challenged, and we also have to factor in that we need to be more disciplined on costs as a result of the growth challenges in some of our businesses. 
So I just want to kind of conclude by saying we have guiding principles around this. We're making targeted investments in businesses that we think can grow: Tinder, Hinge, The League, Chispa, BLK, some of these new apps that we might incubate. That is philosophically what we're trying to do, and we're making expense reductions in businesses where we have less confidence in the growth, primarily the Established Brands. So it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's not a complete broad-based approach. It is targeted investment in some parts of the businesses and reducing costs in corporate and other brands that aren't growing on the flip side. And that's how we're approaching the cost reductions that we're thinking about.
And then the last thing I wanted to add before we just wrap the call up is that any investments we're going to make in new businesses next year or going forward are going to face a very high bar. Especially given the environment we're in, we need to apply a very disciplined lens to making any investments. And so we're reviewing everything very carefully, and we're going through our process now to do all of that. And so we'll have a lot more to communicate both on the cost and margin side, on the investment side as well as what we see as the environment from a macro perspective and revenue growth when we get together again in February on our next call. And I look forward to seeing you all then. BK, any last comments from you?"
