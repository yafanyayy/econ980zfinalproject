We're very pleased with the remarkable progress we made in 2021 across the entire global portfolio despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished the year on a real high note with the emergence of Omicron having a limited impact on results in the fourth quarter. 
In December, global ADR was 3% above 2019 levels, and occupancy for the month gained further ground compared to December of 2019, driving global RevPAR to an 11% decline versus 2019. This was a 53 percentage point improvement from the RevPAR decline in January of 2021. In the fourth quarter, global RevPAR was 19% lower than prepandemic levels. 
Global occupancy for the quarter came in at 58%, 12 percentage points below 2019, while ADR was only 2% shy of 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 15% compared to 2019. Results were driven by strong ADR, which was less than 2% below prepandemic levels. 
Further strengthening of already robust leisure travel and steady improvement in the recovery of business transient and group demand also helped results. Fourth quarter group room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was down 32% versus 2019, a 9% point improvement from the third quarter decline. 
With booking windows still much shorter than usual, in the quarter for the quarter bookings were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Group cancellations ticked up late last year and early this year due to Omicron mostly for arrival dates in January and February, but those cancellations have slowed more recently. 
New group bookings have also been gaining momentum, especially in the year for the year. In fact, just last week, Salesforce held a large company meeting in New York City that was booked just 1 month before the event. It was the largest internal meeting Salesforce has held since the start of the pandemic with over 25,000 room nights across 11 of our properties. 
While special corporate demand in the U.S. and Canada was still well below '19 levels, there was gradual improvement in the fourth quarter. Relative to prepandemic levels, bookings in the quarter were down 33%, 11% -- excuse me, 11 percentage points better than the decline in the bookings in the third quarter. Weekly bookings around the end of last year were impacted by Omicron, but they have recovered since the trough in early January. 
All of our international regions, except for Greater China, posted sequential RevPAR recovery from the third to the fourth quarter as more borders reopened and travel restrictions eased. Greater China's fourth quarter 27% RevPAR decline compared to 2019 was in line with the decline in the third quarter as their 0 COVID policy once again resulted in the lockdown of several cities. 
The Middle East and Africa or MEA region performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, really demonstrating the resilience of travel demand. With relatively high vaccination rates and low travel restrictions during the quarter, the Middle East has become a safe, easy place to visit. 
Led by strength in the UAE, fourth quarter RevPAR in MEA rose 8% in 2019 driven by 20% higher ADR -- excuse me, 8% above '19 driven by 20% higher ADR. Fourth quarter occupancy in MEA topped 65%, the highest of our regions. Leisure demand was remarkably strong, benefiting from a significant increase in international visitors. Room nights from international guests rose nearly 60% from the third to the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the pandemic, strengthening our valuable loyalty platform and engaging with our Marriott Bonvoy members have been key areas of focus. In the fourth quarter of '21, 52% of room nights globally and 58% of room nights in the U.S. and Canada were booked by Bonvoy members. And global membership grew to over 160 million members at year-end driven by strong digital sign-ups. 
Turning to development. Both room additions and signings were strong in '21 despite ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. Despite industry-wide preconstruction and construction delays, some labor shortages and supply chain issues, we added a record 86,000 gross rooms and 517 properties leading to 6.1% gross rooms growth for the year. 
Our global net rooms growth was 3.9%, above our previous expectation, given deletions were towards the low end of those expectations. Our deletion rate for 2021 was 2.1% or 1.2% excluding the exit of 88 Service Properties Trust hotels. 
We are also pleased that we continue to grow our share of rooms globally. In 2021, around 15% of all global new build rooms opened under our brands compared to our year-end room share of 7%. This share is expected to continue as we had 18% of all global rooms under construction at the end of '21, more than twice our current share of open rooms. 
Our development team signed franchise and management agreements for approximately 92,000 rooms during 2021, and our year-end global pipeline totaled roughly 485,000 rooms. The composition of our pipeline dovetails nicely with current demand trends. Leisure demand has led to recovery, and we are well positioned to continue growing our lead in resort destinations, including in the high-growth, all-inclusive space. 
We've also been seeing strong preference for our luxury properties. With luxury rooms accounting for more than 10% of our pipeline, we are poised to further expand our industry-leading portfolio in this valuable high-fee segment. 
Conversions were a significant growth driver in 2021, accounting for 21% of room additions and 27% of signings. With the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system, we anticipate that conversions will remain an important contributor to growth over the next several years. 
For 2022, we expect gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. 
As a reminder, average construction time lines are currently around 2 years for limited service deals and often longer for full service deals. Yet given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our conversion momentum and our industry-leading pipeline, we are confident that over the next several years, we will return to our prepandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. 
Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I did want to share a few highlights of the company's ESG efforts over the course of the year. The Board of Directors and our management team are keenly focused on these important areas as we're committed to making a positive and sustainable impact in the communities where we live and work. 
In June, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we announced we were setting new internal diversity goals for our group of Vice Presidents and above. The new targets aim to achieve global gender parity by 2023, an acceleration of our prior timetable and to increase representation of people of color in the U.S. to 25% by 2025. 
In July, we updated our human trafficking awareness training, which will be made widely available to the entire industry. More than 900,000 associates have now taken training in this area. And in September, we pledged to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius emissions scenarios. 
As I finish my first year as CEO, I want to again thank our incredible associates for all their hard work through these challenging times. I've spent most of the last few months on the road, traveling across the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles and also abroad and have seen firsthand their dedication to serving our guests. I'm so proud of all we've accomplished over the last year and continue to be very optimistic about our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Leeny?"

Our fourth quarter results reflect the clear resilience of travel, our strong focus on cost containment and the benefits of our asset-light business model. 
Gross fee revenues reached $831 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $186 million in the fourth quarter 19% ahead of 2019 levels driven by robust global card spending and new account acquisitions as well as outstanding performance in our branded residential business. 
Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $94 million in the quarter. Just under half of these fees were earned at resort properties with IMF from our comparable luxury resorts up almost 45% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our owned and leased portfolio generated $19 million of profits, a nice increase from a loss of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as results improved at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Our operating teams have done extraordinary work to adapt quickly and return these hotels to breakeven profitability or better despite continued lower-than-normal occupancy levels. 
G&A and other expense totaled $213 million in the fourth quarter, higher than prior expectations as a result of higher compensation costs, including true-ups and higher legal expenses. For full year 2021, G&A and other came in at $823 million, 12% lower than full year 2019, reflecting ongoing savings resulting from our significant restructuring activities in 2020. 
At the hotel level, we have partnered with our owners and franchisees throughout the pandemic, working diligently to lower costs, bring down breakeven occupancy levels and drive cash flow. With the recovery well underway, we're committed to delivering consistent and positive guest experiences while keeping hotel operating costs down. 
Many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we put into place will be maintained as occupancies rebound. While the labor environment is slowly improving, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation. We're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. 
As always, we are also carefully managing cash outlays at the corporate level. We were pleased with our cash flow generation during 2021 and with our year-end liquidity position of over $4.8 billion, which covers near-term debt maturities with significant cushion. 
Our full year cash flows from the loyalty program were positive before considering the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which effectively repaid around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, loyalty cash flows were modestly negative. 
Looking ahead to 2022, there is still too much uncertainty and volatility to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again share some general observations and provide color on certain specific items where we do have some visibility. 
I'll start with some thoughts on the first quarter of 2022. Omicron meaningfully impacted global group and business transient demand in January, historically the lowest occupancy month of the year. While we saw minimal disruption to leisure travel, global RevPAR for the month declined 31% compared to January of '19 primarily due to lower occupancy as rate was just 4% below 2019. 
We expect to see the recovery pace pick up nicely in February and March given weekly bookings across customer segments have now returned to pre-Omicron levels. However, with some countries reinstituting strict travel restrictions earlier this year, we could see first quarter 2022 RevPAR compared to '19 levels take a step back from the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of '21 versus 2019. 
We then expect significant forward progression in the global recovery each quarter through the end of the year. Following the temporary Delta-related slowdown during the third quarter of last year, demand picked up meaningfully through the end of last year. That bolsters our optimism that by the end of the year, the 2022 fourth quarter gap to 2019 fourth quarter RevPAR will narrow meaningfully compared to the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
As additional markets reopen and more employees return to the office, we expect robust ADR, sustained strong leisure transient demand and significant improvement in business transient and group. We also expect to see growth in trips that blend business and leisure. 
International travelers getting back on the road should also drive further improvement in RevPAR. In 2019, nearly 20% of global room nights were from cross-border guests. So far, most global demand during the pandemic has come from domestic visitors. Cross-border room nights in 2021 were down more than 60% compared to 2019 while domestic room nights were down 16% over the same time period. 
Our fourth quarter performance in the Middle East illustrates how impactful the return of international travel can be. We're encouraged by the swift pickup in booking activity that we've seen in the last few weeks in places that are opening up, such as Thailand and the Cayman Islands. 
Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year '22 RevPAR versus full year '21 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. This sensitivity is no longer compared to 2019 as the compounding impact from new rooms growth contributions makes the comparison less relevant 3 years out. 
In 2022, we expect continued growth from our non-RevPAR-related fees driven by higher contributions from credit card fees. We also anticipate profit growth from our owned and leased portfolio as the global environment improves. 
For the full year, interest expense net is anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is expected to be around 23%. G&A and other expenses could total $860 million to $880 million, still well below 2019 levels but higher on a year-over-year basis primarily due to higher compensation costs and assumed higher travel expenses. 
As always, driving cash flow will be a priority in 2022. We anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We expect cash flows from loyalty to be slightly positive in 2022 before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. 
We made great progress in improving our credit ratios during 2021 and remain focused on bringing our leverage in line with our target of 3 to 3.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Assuming the recovery continues largely as anticipated, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. 
We would likely begin by paying a dividend with a payout ratio a bit below our traditional 30%. We can then see more meaningful levels of capital returns, including share repurchases, along with dividends in 2023 and beyond. 
Over the last 2 years, our business has been tested in ways we never could have imagined. We're incredibly proud of how our teams have adapted and how well our company has performed. We made significant progress in 2021 and are excited about continued recovery and our growth opportunities ahead.

Well, as we've said the last couple of quarters, the ripple effects of the pandemic create less visibility beyond '22 than we might like. 
With that said, I think you heard the momentum on signings in my prepared remarks. We continue to see good volume on the conversion front. In the short term, obviously, we've got a bit of challenges in terms of construction starts, particularly in the U.S. But in some ways, that causes us to think about it as a when, not an if. 
And in fact, one of the statistics we look at most closely is fallout from the pipeline. If we were seeing wholesale project cancellations, that might cause us to think differently about the medium to long term. But in fact, what we saw in 2021 was about 6.5% lower than our average fallout over the last decade."

I could imagine that it's possible that you have that happen, Shaun. I think though, so much of this really depends on the global picture in terms of the pace of the recovery.

So we had a great fourth quarter. But we have traditionally been fairly steady unless there is a certain group of hotels that have all kind of come on at the same time. 
So I would say we've always tended to have some quarter-to-quarter variations, but that should march forward fairly squarely throughout the quarters on the opening side. I guess the only other thing to point out is just a reminder that construction for a limited service hotel takes, broadly speaking, 2 years, and full service takes longer. 
So as you start to think about 2020 and recognize that as you get into Q3 of 2020, you were in the depths of the pandemic and starting to really see the impact on construction starts. That will start to obviously then have an impact as you go into '22."

So in that regard, even in '22, I would expect our fees to be a little bit lower than they were in '21 because in '21, it was -- we just had so many sales in residential. So I expect them to be a bit lower, although still meaningfully higher than our traditional levels of residential branding fees. 
And yes, you're right, they're lumpy because you can have 1 unit of 100 units goes into sales and closes literally within a quarter or 2, and then another one might not happen for 2 more quarters. So it is likely to be lumpy. And again, overall, we're really pleased with new signings that we're getting in the residential branded business.

The incremental flexibility that you're seeing in working from home, working from anywhere has been an accelerant for leisure demand. And if anything, we expect further acceleration in that regard. 
And then when we look at our forward bookings, we already have more leisure on the books for months further out than we did in the same months last year. So we continue to be quite bullish on accelerated growth in leisure. And remember, leisure was already growing much more rapidly than business transient even prepandemic. 
And maybe the last part of my answer would be you heard Leeny talk a little bit about how modest cross-border travel has been. We've really only seen domestic leisure travel. And as more and more borders open, we think that influx of international leisure travel will also serve to accelerate the pace of leisure demand growth."

Now as you know, we've got the reality that for more complex hotels, they're -- it's a much higher percentage of costs that are labor-related. And we're obviously seeing a lot of pressure on that side, just like every other industry in the U.S. 
So there, we are -- we will continue to find ways to try to improve the margins. Rising occupancy, obviously, always ultimately helps you when you're spreading costs at a hotel. But it also means you've also got to make sure to have enough people there to deliver the service that our guests expect, and we are committed to making sure that we deliver those experiences that bring them back to our hotels over and over. 
And then the last thing I'll mention is just the great part about our business is we do reprice our rooms every day.

And I think one of the really exciting things for us was as our credit card platforms continue to grow, they really gave us a unique opportunity to stay engaged with those most valuable Bonvoy customers even when they had hit the pause button on the volume of travel they experienced prior to the start of the pandemic."

And then also just when you think about the growth in our digital share, and that is very much tied to the Bonvoy platform. And when you look at our digital share compared to '19, the share of reservations has gone up almost 500 basis points on our digital channel. 
And overall, we've grown up 300 basis points in our direct channels up to 76%. So I think that all ties very well into the power of Bonvoy."

If we get a full RevPAR recovery kind of into 2023, is that enough to get the incentive fees back to prepandemic levels? Or what's the dynamics that will kind of keep us away from that? And then a similar question on the owned and leased profitability. Is inflation going to hold back the recovery there?"

You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of -- in '21, to your point about inflation. 
At the same time, one of the things I think is what's been so impressive about the operating teams is we used to think about breakeven levels for a full-service hotel of 40% to 50% occupancy. And what you're finding is that with the great work that they've done on managing the hotel and dramatically lower occupancies that they've been able to return these hotels to either neutral profitability at dramatically lower levels of breakeven occupancy. And so I think that will really help offset on the inflation side. 
The other comment I'll make is on the incentive fee side is just a reminder that it depends a whole lot on where. So just when you think broadly speaking, we were at almost 72% of our hotels were earning IMF in 2019, and we're now still a tad under 50%. And where you see the biggest difference is really domestically in the U.S. And that is that with owners' priorities, that is going to mean you really need to get back to those hurdles of levels of actual real profits before we're going to get our incentive fees. 
Now internationally, no surprise, where you've got quite a bit more of hotels without the owner's priority. There, you're already seeing dramatically higher percentages of hotels earning IMF. So I think we've got some great potential in the international hotels where there have been such restrictions on entering the country, and they're more dependent on international travelers. I think of Asia Pacific outside of China as an example there. 
And in the U.S., I think as you heard me say in our comments, the IMF that we're getting from the resorts have just been fantastic and in many cases, are already above 2019 levels. So when you think about the large cities in the U.S. and their greater relative dependence on international travel, I think it delivers a lot of confidence that we will get back. I just think predicting whether that is '23 or not is probably a bridge too far, but certainly moving in the right direction."

So an overwhelming part, like, for example, our sales and marketing fees are contractually set at a percentage of revenues of the hotels. So they are, by nature, going to move up and down. 
The other thing is to recognize that we worked very hard on certain parts of the fees where we were able to impact kind of the fixed and floating component. And so that we do believe that there is more efficiency as we grow larger in terms of what we can do for the hotels. And as an example, when you're a digital share, your direct share of reservations is growing as well as it is. 
It's just a reminder that those are some of the lowest cost reservations for a hotel as possible. But we did lower our fixed cost by roughly 30% for the system. But as I said before, overwhelmingly, the charges are based on a function of hotel revenues."

Now the OTAs are up with all this leisure business by 200 basis points, and they're at 14% in 2021. But at the same time, a direct share of total room nights is up to 76.3%, and that's actually up 340 basis points. 
So actually, our direct channels have grown meaningfully more than the OTAs. The OTAs have clearly obviously benefited from the leisure business. And GDS classically and more related to business travel has been the one that has lost the most share. 
And the only other thing that I'll mention because I just find it interesting that also within the direct share growth is the movement off of voice to digital. And I think that all makes sense when you think about our Bonvoy technology and our app and how many downloads we get that our guests are feeling more and more comfortable using the digital channel, which, again, is an incredibly efficient channel from a cost perspective and from a value delivery to the customer."

But the other part that I'll point out when we talked about where we were at the beginning of '21 is that we actually expect the deletions to be higher. And I think you all will remember that my comments then reflected probably about 50 basis points of an expected COVID-related hedge that it was hard to predict at that point where exactly all these hotels would go as we move through the pandemic. 
And I think happily with a lot of work on everybody's part, including the owners in revenue management and on the cost side, that -- and the banks have been very good partners to work with as well. We have seen deletions come in better than we expected. And that has also ended up helping the net rooms growth number even compared to where we were 4 months ago."

And in cases where the markets have really not recovered, we are not going to feel compelled to rush that sale. So in that regard, it will really vary. 
We've also got JV interest as you know. For example, our St. Regis [indiscernible] JV was sold during 2021. That market was doing great. The hotel was in great shape, and we were able to get a really good sales price on that asset. So I think it really does depend a lot on the situation. 
Remember that owned lease also has termination fees, and that also I would expect not to be growing, but also to continue to provide somewhere in the ballpark of $40 million in fees a year. And then on the owned leased profit, I think you will continue to see progress. But do remember that we have a chunk of leased hotels. And there, you obviously need to get to where you're covering your fixed rent payment to the extent it is fixed rent, which will mean it behaves a little bit more like a U.S. owner's priority where you need to get to a floor before you're actually getting any profit.

We're very pleased with the remarkable progress we made in 2021 across the entire global portfolio despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished the year on a real high note, with the emergence of Omicron having a limited impact on results in the fourth quarter.  
In December, global ADR was 3% above 2019 levels, and occupancy for the month gained further ground compared to December of 2019, driving global RevPAR to an 11% decline versus 2019. This was a 53 percentage point improvement from the RevPAR decline in January of 2021. 
In the fourth quarter, global RevPAR was 19% lower than pre-pandemic levels.  Global occupancy for the quarter came in at 58%, 12 percentage points below 2019, while ADR was only 2% shy of 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 15% compared to 2019. Results were driven by strong ADR, which was less than 2% below pre-pandemic levels.  
Further strengthening of already robust leisure travel and steady improvement in the recovery of business transient and group demand also helped results. Fourth quarter group room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was down 32% versus 2019, a 9% point improvement from the third quarter decline. With booking windows still much shorter than usual, in the quarter for the quarter bookings were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Group cancellations ticked up late last year and early this year due to Omicron mostly for arrival dates in January and February, but those cancellations have slowed more recently. New group bookings have also been gaining momentum, especially in the year for the year. In fact, just last week, Salesforce held a large company meeting in New York City that was booked just 1 month before the event. It was the largest internal meeting Salesforce has held since the start of the pandemic, with over 25,000 room nights across 11 of our properties.  
While special corporate demand in the U.S. and Canada were still well below '19 levels, there was gradual improvement in the fourth quarter. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, bookings in the quarter were down 33%, 11% -- or excuse me, 11 percentage points better than the decline in the bookings in the third quarter. Weekly bookings around the end of last year were impacted by Omicron, but they have recovered since the trough in early January.  
All of our international regions, except for Greater China, posted sequential RevPAR recovery from the third to the fourth quarter as more borders reopened and travel restrictions eased. Greater China's fourth quarter 27% RevPAR decline compared to 2019 was in line with the decline in the third quarter as their zero-COVID policy once again resulted in the lockdown of several cities.  
The Middle East and Africa or MEA region performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, really demonstrating the resilience of travel demand. With relatively high vaccination rates and low travel restrictions during the quarter, the Middle East has become a safe, easy place to visit. Led by strength in the UAE, fourth quarter RevPAR in MEA rose 8% in 2019, driven by 20% higher ADR -- excuse me, 8% above '19, driven by 20% higher ADR. 
Fourth quarter occupancy in MEA topped 65%, the highest of our regions. Leisure demand was remarkably strong, benefiting from a significant increase in international visitors. Room nights from international guests rose nearly 60% from the third to the fourth quarter.  
Throughout the pandemic, strengthening our valuable loyalty platform and engaging with our Marriott Bonvoy members have been key areas of focus. In the fourth quarter of '21, 52% of room nights globally and 58% of room nights in the U.S. and Canada were booked by Bonvoy members. And global membership grew to over 160 million members at year-end, driven by strong digital sign-ups.  
Turning to development. Both room additions and signings were strong in '21 despite ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. Despite industry-wide preconstruction and construction delays, some labor shortages and supply chain issues, we added a record 86,000 gross rooms and 517 properties leading to 6.1% gross rooms growth for the year.  
Our global net rooms growth was 3.9%, above our previous expectation, given deletions were towards the low end of those expectations. Our deletion rate for 2021 was 2.1% or 1.2%, excluding the exit of 88 Service Properties Trust hotels.  
We are also pleased that we continue to grow our share of rooms globally. In 2021, around 15% of all global new build rooms opened under our brands compared to our year-end room share of 7%. This share is expected to continue as we had 18% of all global rooms under construction at the end of '21, more than twice our current share of open rooms.  
Our development team signed franchise and management agreements for approximately 92,000 rooms during 2021, and our year-end global pipeline totaled roughly 485,000 rooms. The composition of our pipeline dovetails nicely with current demand trends. Leisure demand has led to recovery, and we are well positioned to continue growing our lead in resort destinations, including in the high-growth, all-inclusive space.  
We've also been seeing strong preference for our luxury properties. With luxury rooms accounting for more than 10% of our pipeline, we are poised to further expand our industry-leading portfolio in this valuable high-fee segment.  
Conversions were a significant growth driver in 2021, accounting for 21% of room additions and 27% of signings. With the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system, we anticipate that conversions will remain an important contributor to growth over the next several years.  
For 2022, we expect gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S.  
As a reminder, average construction time lines are currently around 2 years for limited-service deals and often longer for full-service deals. Yet given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our conversion momentum and our industry-leading pipeline, we are confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate.  
Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I did want to share a few highlights of the company's ESG efforts over the course of the year. The Board of Directors and our management team are keenly focused on these important areas as we're committed to making a positive and sustainable impact in the communities where we live and work.  
In June, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we announced we were setting new internal diversity goals for our group of Vice Presidents and above. The new targets aim to achieve global gender parity by 2023, an acceleration of our prior timetable, and to increase representation of people of color in the U.S. to 25% by 2025.  
In July, we updated our human trafficking awareness training, which will be made widely available to the entire industry. More than 900,000 associates have now taken training in this area. And in September, we pledged to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius emissions scenarios.  
As I finish my first year as CEO, I want to again thank our incredible associates for all their hard work through these challenging times. I've spent most of the last few months on the road, traveling across the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles and also abroad, and have seen firsthand their dedication to serving our guests. I'm so proud of all we've accomplished over the last year and continue to be very optimistic about our outlook for 2022 and beyond.

Our fourth quarter results reflect the clear resilience of travel, our strong focus on cost containment and the benefits of our asset-light business model.  
Gross fee revenues reached $831 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $186 million in the fourth quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels, driven by robust global card spending and new account acquisitions as well as outstanding performance in our branded residential business.  
Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $94 million in the quarter. Just under half of these fees were earned at resort properties, with IMF from our comparable luxury resorts up almost 45% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Our owned and leased portfolio generated $19 million of profits, a nice increase from a loss of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as results improved at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Our operating teams have done extraordinary work to adapt quickly and return these hotels to breakeven profitability or better despite continued lower-than-normal occupancy levels.  
G&A and other expense totaled $213 million in the fourth quarter, higher than prior expectations as a result of higher compensation costs, including true-ups and higher legal expenses. For full year 2021, G&A and other came in at $823 million, 12% lower than full year 2019, reflecting ongoing savings resulting from our significant restructuring activities in 2020.  
At the hotel level, we have partnered with our owners and franchisees throughout the pandemic, working diligently to lower costs, bring down breakeven occupancy levels and drive cash flow. With the recovery well underway, we're committed to delivering consistent and positive guest experiences while keeping hotel operating costs down.  
Many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we put into place will be maintained as occupancies rebound. While the labor environment is slowly improving, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation. We're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years.  
As always, we are also carefully managing cash outlays at the corporate level. We were pleased with our cash flow generation during 2021 and with our year-end liquidity position of over $4.8 billion, which covers near-term debt maturities with significant cushion.  
Our full year cash flows from the loyalty program were positive before considering the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which effectively repaid around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, loyalty cash flows were modestly negative.  
Looking ahead to 2022, there is still too much uncertainty and volatility to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again share some general observations and provide color on certain specific items where we do have some visibility.  
I'll start with some thoughts on the first quarter of 2022. Omicron meaningfully impacted global group and business transient demand in January, historically the lowest occupancy month of the year. While we saw minimal disruption to leisure travel, global RevPAR for the month declined 31% compared to January of '19, primarily due to lower occupancy as rate was just 4% below 2019.  
We expect to see the recovery pace pick up nicely in February and March given weekly bookings across customer segments have now returned to pre-Omicron levels. However, with some countries reinstituting strict travel restrictions earlier this year, we could see first quarter 2022 RevPAR compared to '19 levels take a step back from the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of '21 versus 2019. We then expect significant forward progression in the global recovery each quarter through the end of the year. 
Following the temporary Delta-related slowdown during the third quarter of last year, demand picked up meaningfully through the end of last year. That bolsters our optimism that by the end of the year, the 2022 fourth quarter gap to 2019 fourth quarter RevPAR will narrow meaningfully compared to the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of 2021.  
As additional markets reopen and more employees return to the office, we expect robust ADR, sustained strong leisure transient demand and significant improvement in business transient and group. We also expect to see growth in trips that blend business and leisure.  
International travelers getting back on the road should also drive further improvement in RevPAR. In 2019, nearly 20% of global room nights were from cross-border guests. So far, most global demand during the pandemic has come from domestic visitors. Cross-border room nights in 2021 were down more than 60% compared to 2019 while domestic room nights were down 16% over the same time period.  
Our fourth quarter performance in the Middle East illustrates how impactful the return of international travel can be. We're encouraged by the swift pickup in booking activity that we've seen in the last few weeks in places that are opening up, such as Thailand and the Cayman Islands.  
Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year '22 RevPAR versus full year '21 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. This sensitivity is no longer compared to 2019 as the compounding impact from new rooms growth contributions makes the comparison less relevant 3 years out.  
In 2022, we expect continued growth from our non-RevPAR-related fees driven by higher contributions from credit card fees. We also anticipate profit growth from our owned and leased portfolio as the global environment improves.  
For the full year, interest expense net is anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is expected to be around 23%. G&A and other expenses could total $860 million to $880 million, still well below 2019 levels but higher on a year-over-year basis primarily due to higher compensation costs and assumed higher travel expenses.  
As always, driving cash flow will be a priority in 2022. We anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. We expect cash flows from loyalty to be slightly positive in 2022 before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies.  
We made great progress in improving our credit ratios during 2021 and remain focused on bringing our leverage in line with our target of 3 to 3.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Assuming the recovery continues largely as anticipated, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022.  
We would likely begin by paying a dividend with a payout ratio a bit below our traditional 30%. We can then see more meaningful levels of capital returns, including share repurchases, along with dividends in 2023 and beyond.  
Over the last 2 years, our business has been tested in ways we never could have imagined. We're incredibly proud of how our teams have adapted and how well our company has performed. We made significant progress in 2021 and are excited about continued recovery and our growth opportunities ahead.

Well, as we've said the last couple of quarters, the ripple effects of the pandemic create less visibility beyond '22 than we might like. With that said, I think you heard the momentum on signings in my prepared remarks. We continue to see good volume on the conversion front. 
In the short term, obviously, we've got a bit of challenges in terms of construction starts, particularly in the U.S. But in some ways, that causes us to think about it as a when, not an if. And in fact, one of the statistics we look at most closely is fallout from the pipeline. 
If we were seeing wholesale project cancellations, that might cause us to think differently about the medium to long term. But in fact, what we saw in 2021 was about 6.5% lower than our average fallout over the last decade."

So we had a great fourth quarter. But we have traditionally -- it's been fairly steady, unless there is a certain group of hotels that have all kind of come on at the same time.  
So I would say, we've always tended to have some quarter-to-quarter variations, but that should march forward fairly squarely throughout the quarters on the openings side. I guess, the only other thing to point out is just a reminder that construction for a limited-service hotel takes, broadly speaking, 2 years, and full-service takes longer.  
So as you'd start to think about 2020 and recognize that as you get into Q3 of 2020, you were in the depths of the pandemic and starting to really see the impact on construction starts. That will start to obviously then have an impact as you go into '22."

So in that regard, even in '22, I would expect our fees to be a little bit lower than they were in '21. Because in '21, it was -- we just had so many sales in residential. So I expect them to be a bit lower, although still meaningfully higher than our traditional levels of residential branding fees.  
And yes, you're right. They're lumpy because you can have 1 unit of 100 units that goes into sales and closes literally within a quarter or 2, and then another one might not happen for 2 more quarters. So it is likely to be lumpy. And again, overall, we're really pleased with new signings that we're getting in the residential branded business.

The incremental flexibility that you're seeing in working from home, working from anywhere, has been an accelerant for leisure demand.

And then when we look at our forward bookings, we already have more leisure on the books for months further out than we did in the same months last year. So we continue to be quite bullish on accelerated growth in leisure. And remember, leisure was already growing much more rapidly than business transient even pre pandemic.  
And maybe the last part of my answer would be, you heard Leeny talk a little bit about how modest cross-border travel has been. We've really only seen domestic leisure travel. And as more and more borders open, we think that influx of international leisure travel will also serve to accelerate the pace of leisure demand growth."

And as I said in my comments, I think there is quite a bit of the savings that we put into place that is permanent, that will mean kind of significantly lower costs and significantly better productivity as we move forward. 
Now as you know, we've got the reality that for more complex hotels, there is a much higher percentage of costs that are labor-related. And we're obviously seeing a lot of pressure on that side, just like every other industry in the U.S. So there, we are -- we will continue to find ways to try to improve the margins. 
Rising occupancy, obviously, always ultimately helps you when you're spreading costs at a hotel. But it also means you've also got to make sure to have enough people there to deliver the service that our guests expect. And we are committed to making sure that we deliver those experiences that bring them back to our hotels over and over. 
And then the last thing I'll mention is just the great part about our business is we do reprice our rooms every day.

If we get a full RevPAR recovery kind of into 2023, is that enough to get the incentive fees back to pre-pandemic levels? 
Or what's the dynamics that will kind of keep us away from that? And then a similar question on the owned and leased profitability, is inflation going to hold back the recovery there?"

You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of --",406,"Right. So a couple of things. You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of -- in '21, to your point, about inflation. 
At the same time, one of the things I think is -- what's been so impressive about the operating teams is we used to think about breakeven levels for a full-service hotel of 40% to 50% occupancy. And what you're finding is that, with the great work that they've done on managing the hotel and dramatically lower occupancies, that they've been able to return these hotels to either neutral profitability at dramatically lower levels of breakeven occupancy. And so I think that will really help offset on the inflation side. 
The other comment I'll make is on the incentive fee side is just a reminder that it depends a whole lot on where. So just when you think, broadly speaking, we were at almost 72% of our hotels were earning IMF in 2019, and we're now still a tad under 50%. And where you see the biggest difference is really domestically in the U.S. And that is that, with owners' priorities, that is going to mean you really need to get back to those hurdles of levels of actual real profits before we're going to get our incentive fees. 
Now internationally, no surprise, where you've got quite a bit more of hotels without the owner's priority. There, you're already seeing dramatically higher percentages of hotels earning IMF. So I think we've got some great potential in the international hotels, where there have been such restrictions on entering the country, and they're more dependent on international travelers. I think of Asia Pacific outside of China as an example there. 
And in the U.S., I think, as you heard me say in our comments, the IMF that we're getting from the resorts have just been fantastic and, in many cases, are already above 2019 levels. So when you think about the large cities in the U.S. and their greater relative dependence on international travel, I think it delivers a lot of confidence that we will get back. I just think predicting whether that is '23 or not is probably a bridge too far, but certainly moving in the right direction."

So an overwhelming part, like, for example, our sales and marketing fees are contractually set at a percentage of revenues of the hotels. So they are, by nature, going to move up and down. 
The other thing is to recognize that we worked very hard on certain parts of the fees where we were able to impact kind of the fixed and floating component. And so that we do believe that there is more efficiency as we grow larger in terms of what we can do for the hotels. 
And as an example, when your  digital share -- your direct share of reservations is growing as well as it is, it's just a reminder that those are some of the lowest-cost reservations for a hotel as possible. But we did lower our fixed cost by roughly 30% for the system. But as I said before, overwhelmingly, the charges are based on a function of hotel revenues."

Now the OTAs are up with all this leisure business by 200 basis points, and they're at 14% in 2021. But at the same time, a direct share of total room nights is up to 76.3%, and that's actually up 340 basis points. 
So actually, our direct channels have grown meaningfully more than the OTAs. The OTAs have clearly, obviously, benefited from the leisure business. And GDS, classically, and more related to business travel has been the one that has lost the most share. 
And the only other thing that I'll mention because I just find it interesting that also within the direct share growth is the movement off of voice to digital. And I think that all makes sense when you think about our Bonvoy technology and our app and how many downloads we get that our guests are feeling more and more comfortable using the digital channel, which, again, is an incredibly efficient channel from a cost perspective and from a value delivery to the customer."

We do see some delays that come out the back end. But I think maybe the most relevant statistics are the pace at which shovels are going in the ground and the lengthening we've seen in the construction cycle. You heard Leeny in her remarks talk about roughly 24 months, start to finish, as an average for our select-service hotels here in the U.S. There's not a lot we can do to accelerate that.

But the other part that I'll point out when we talked about where we were at the beginning of '21 is that we actually expect the deletions to be higher. And I think you all will remember that my comments then reflected probably about 50 basis points of an expected COVID-related hedge that it was hard to predict at that point where exactly all these hotels would go as we move through the pandemic. 
And I think happily, with a lot of work on everybody's part, including the owners, in revenue management and on the cost side, that -- and the banks have been very good partners to work with as well, we have seen deletions come in better than we expected.

And in cases where the markets have really not recovered, we are not going to feel compelled to rush that sale. So in that regard, it will really vary. 
We've also got JV interests, as you know. For example, our St. Regis Punta Mita JV was sold during 2021. That market was doing great. That hotel was in great shape, and we were able to get a really good sales price on that asset. So I think it really does depend a lot on the situation. 
Remember that owned-leased also has termination fees. And that, also, I would expect not to be growing, but also to continue to provide somewhere in the ballpark of $40 million in fees a year. And then on the owned-leased profits, I think you will continue to see progress. But do remember that we have a chunk of leased hotels. 
And there, you obviously need to get to where you're covering your fixed rent payment, to the extent it is fixed rent, which will mean it behaves a little bit more like a U.S. owner's priority, where you need to get to a floor before you're actually getting any profit. So I think we look forward to seeing the numbers get better and better. But in terms of getting back to the full levels of 2019, I think it will take a little bit of time."

Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron-related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy rose to 64%, with ADR an impressive 5% above March of 2019. 
COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world, but as global vaccination rates increase, case counts decline and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe. Many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy, leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel. 
Leisure demand, which had already fully recovered during 2021, has further strengthened this year, with first quarter global leisure transient room nights more than 10% above 2019. Recovery of business transient and group demand is still lagging leisure, but as greater numbers of employees return to the office, demand has been rapidly improving. 
Additionally, day of the week trends continue to show that trips that blend leisure and business are on the rise. In March, in the U.S. and Canada, while Monday through Wednesday occupancy was down in the mid-teens, occupancy during the shoulder days, Thursday and Sunday, was down in the single digits and occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was nearly in line with March of 2019. 
While still below pre-pandemic room nights, cross-border travel demand is growing slowly as more countries around the world reopen their borders and lift travel restrictions. Cross-border guests accounted for 14% of global room nights in the first quarter, a gain of around 100 basis points compared to a quarter ago, but well below the 2019 share of 19%. 
In the U.S. and Canada, March RevPAR was within 4% of 2019. Occupancy topped 68% during the month and ADR accelerated to 6% over pre-pandemic levels. While the extent of RevPAR recovery still varies widely from city to city, overall, progress during the quarter was widespread. Across all chain scales as well as market types, that is primary, secondary and tertiary markets, RevPAR recovery saw a meaningful improvement in March versus the fourth quarter. 
Luxury was the standout in the quarter, with ADR a remarkable 27% above pre-pandemic rates. Group demand in the U.S. and Canada accelerated sharply during the first quarter. In March, group RevPAR was 16% below 2019 compared to down more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Growth in new bookings has contributed to a meaningful improvement in group pays for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, group revenue pays for the remainder of 2022 was down in the high single-digit range compared to 2019. We also expect additional short-term bookings to further boost group revenues. April was the eighth month in a row where in the year for the year group bookings exceeded 2019 levels. 
Importantly, our sales teams remain focused on driving ADR, which has continued to rise for new bookings. ADR for managed hotel bookings made in January was 3% above 2019 levels, while ADR for bookings made in March had risen to 12% above pre-pandemic levels. 
Business transient demand in the U.S. also gained momentum during the quarter. Recovery in March improved notably compared to the fourth quarter, with business transient room nights down 10% to 15%. Special corporate accounts, which tend to be larger companies, have recovered more slowly than smaller-sized businesses, which have now fully recovered. Special corporate new bookings strengthened in March and further advanced in April. 
Internationally, all regions, except for Greater China, experienced additional RevPAR recovery in March compared to the fourth quarter recovery. In the Middle East and Africa, where borders have been opened since late last year, first quarter performance was stellar, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. This was led by strength in the UAE from the World Expo in Dubai that ran from October of 2021 through March of this year. 
At the other end of the spectrum, in Greater China, where restrictions have been the most severe, RevPAR dropped significantly with the lockdown of several major cities, including Shanghai, late in the quarter. We are keeping a close eye on trends in Europe, but outside of Russia, the war in Ukraine has not yet impacted demand. Cancellations have been minimal. And as all countries in the region have removed or reduced travel restrictions, bookings across the rest of Europe have accelerated for spring and the summer high season. 
In Russia, we've closed our corporate offices and paused all future hotel development and new hotel openings. There are currently 23 properties opened in the country, though occupancies are modest. We continue to evaluate our operations in Russia, which represented well under 1% of our global fees in 2019. 
We are watching the horrific humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries with deep concern. And we're doing what we can to help those impacted in the region. I'm very proud of our teams that have been mobilizing to help those in need in numerous ways, including working with relief partners and housing refugees at Marriott properties in neighboring countries. 
The power of Marriott Bonvoy was, again, evident in the quarter, as we remain focused on strengthening our loyalty platform for our 164 million members. Of course, member engagement has risen as travel demand comes back, but there has also been a significant increase in members earning and using points outside of our hotels. Our Bonvoy members are interacting with us more through everyday spending, thanks to our collaborations with companies like Uber. We have also seen incredible global interest in and engagement with our Bonvoy co-brand cards, with new card acquisitions and card spend both up meaningfully year-over-year. 
The first quarter also marked our best quarter ever for direct digital bookings, which helped drive owner and franchisee profitability. Digital bookings were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019, partially driven by meaningfully higher downloads of our redesigned Bonvoy app, which were 70% above pre-pandemic levels. 
Turning to development. The number of deals presented at our monthly development committee meetings has continued to increase. We signed 124 deals globally through March of this year, a new first quarter record. Conversion activity remains a bright spot, given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system. 
Conversions accounted for 22% of room additions in the quarter. Despite construction time lines having lengthened a bit so far this year due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we expect openings to ramp up each quarter in 2022. Average construction time lines are currently just over 2 years for limited service properties and remain longer for full-service properties. 
Looking ahead, we still expect full year gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. 
With financing starting to ease a bit, the industry has seen a notable ramp-up in new construction starts in the first quarter, but they are still well below 2019 levels. However, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our momentum around conversions and the largest pipeline in the industry. 
In closing, I feel extremely optimistic about our future. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands and over 8,000 properties worldwide, our invaluable Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our numerous growth opportunities and the best associates in the business, I believe Marriott is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued recovery ahead. 
I will now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Our first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations, with global RevPAR down 19% compared to 2019. Gross fee revenues totaled $815 million in the quarter, almost doubling from a year ago, driven overwhelmingly by higher RevPAR. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees, once again, showed meaningful growth, totaling $170 million in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year credit card fees. 
Incentive management fees, or IMF, are rebounding nicely and reached $102 million in the quarter. They comprise 13% of total gross fees, an acceleration from 7% in the year ago quarter, driven in part by strong performance at our U.S. and Canada hotels. Over 55% of our IMFs were earned at our industry-leading luxury properties. IMFs from our comp luxury hotels were 10% above the first quarter of 2019, while IMFs from our comp luxury resorts were up more than 60% over the same time frame. Roughly 60% of IMFs were earned at our international properties during the quarter. 
Our owned and leased portfolio, again, generated positive profits, totaling $44 million in the quarter due to international government subsidies and improved results at hotels in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America and Europe. G&A and other expense totaled $208 million in the first quarter due to timing and lower travel costs as a result of the Omicron variant. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $759 million, down only 8% compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
We remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while also containing operating costs. Our U.S. managed hotels profit margins were nearly back to 2019 levels in the first quarter, despite RevPAR down 16% compared to 2019. While industry staffing challenges persist, primarily in certain U.S. markets, we've made great progress since last summer in successfully hiring for open positions. As always, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation, but we're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we're very pleased with the positive momentum and demand we're seeing across customer segments in the vast majority of markets around the world. With the recent widespread easing of travel restrictions in many regions, employees returning to the office in greater numbers, increasingly positive travel sentiment and our team's focus on ADR, we're even more optimistic than we were a quarter ago that we'll see meaningful additional global RevPAR recovery this year, assuming no major change in the global economic environment or the behavior of the virus. 
There's still too much volatility given uncertainty around travel restrictions in countries like China and a high reliance on cross-border guests across our international markets to give global RevPAR or specific earnings guidance. But we do have more visibility in our largest market, the U.S. and Canada, which is almost entirely dependent on domestic travelers. 
In the U.S. and Canada, occupancy and ADR continued to improve in April, and we estimate that RevPAR fully recovered to 2019 levels for the month. We're extremely pleased to reach this milestone roughly 2 years after the pandemic began. 
While demand still varies considerably across hotel types and markets, given current booking and ADR trends, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada to be roughly flat to 2019 in the remaining quarters of 2022. Internationally, we expect continued RevPAR recovery across markets that have not yet fully recovered, though the levels of progress will vary widely across regions. 
To further help with your modeling, let me share some additional color. At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2022 RevPAR versus full year 2021 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. 
For the full year, interest expense net is still anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is now expected to be around 24%. G&A and other expenses are still anticipated to be $860 million to $880 million, well below 2019. We still anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. 
We could now see loyalty be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. With the meaningful pickup in demand, we've seen an increase in redemption activity and expect this trend to persist. 
We've made meaningful progress in driving cash flow, managing expenses and improving our credit profile. Given this progress as well as the strength of our business and our confidence and our outlook improving further, we're very pleased to be resuming capital returns to shareholders sooner than we had anticipated. With leverage close to our target ratio of between 3 and 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, we're resuming our dividend at $0.30 a share in the second quarter, the first dividend in 2 years. 
We remain committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that increases shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Assuming the global demand environment continues to improve and that we are within our target leverage ratio range, we expect to resume share repurchases this year. 
Our business model has demonstrated terrific resilience, and I want to thank our teams all over the world for helping us navigate the challenges over the past 2 years. It's thrilling to see so many hotels full of guests again, and we're very optimistic about the future of travel and the future of Marriott International.

As you know, many of the development projects that we entertain in Greater China come to us when they are well under construction. And so one of the metrics we use to evaluate growth pace is intake of MOUs or LOIs, and we've seen pretty steady pace of MOU intake even during the impact of the zero COVID policy across China. 
We have seen some construction interruption as we've seen here in the U.S. But for the first time, we're starting to see some real traction on the conversion side, which has not historically been particularly active source of rooms growth across Greater China."

So I think, generally, as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years.

So I think, generally, as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years. And as you probably heard us say, we actually saw credit card fees in Q1 '22, up 26% compared to '19. So they really and obviously up a whole lot over last year as well. 
So it's a combination of 2 things, Stephen. One is that we continue to see overall credit card spend increase and then our new card acquisition growth has also been impressive. So I think as you continue to see that moving forward, that's a strength. 
The other thing is, obviously, we are a card that tends to be logged by people who love to travel. So there, again, as you see people returning to travel, I think that's also great incentive with all the Bonvoy points that they earned. So I think you'll continue to see that be a strong force in the growth in our fees this year. 
And as you think about the cash flow, there are 2 points that I'd make on working capital. One is that, generally speaking, as you remember, we are a negative working capital business overall. And as the company recovery continues. I think that trend will continue to show itself from the standpoint that our fees get paid so quickly, while it's not always the case that our payables have to be paid quite as quickly. So that will continue to help us on the working capital side. 
And as you pointed out, on loyalty, we have moved from where we thought it was a slight source of cash to a slight use of cash as a result of higher redemptions. I think you should expect as the year moves on that, that will continue, but that is our current forecast for the year that ties into these RevPAR numbers that we've talked about in the U.S."

When you look at the composition of that line, I mean, it's 34% of the -- this quarter's franchise and other fees relates to the non-RevPAR fees. It was a similar percentage in the fourth quarter. 
When you think about it, when you're coming out of this year going into next year, how do you look at that percentage? Or how do you kind of look at the trajectory of credit card fees and then non-franchise fees there?"

But I think one thing to remember is that the residential is lumpy. So just as a reminder, last year, for example, we had $67 million in fees in 2021 for residential and the year before that, it was well under half of that. So just remember, that's a terrifically strong business for us, and we love what we see in terms of signings and performance. But it is based on the pace of those sales of those residences. And so it does vary up and down. 
But on the credit card part, which is, as you know, well over half of the total number of, for example, 170 in the first quarter. I think steady as she goes, not willing to give a particular growth percentage, but I think it is really both the combination of strength of the consumer. So we're assuming that there's not a big change in the macroeconomic picture. 
And then number two is the connection to Bonvoy and to our overall system. And I think that, that has definitely been part of what you're seeing in the growth. Just to remind you where we were pre-COVID is that the credit card growth was in the high single digits pre-COVID. Now obviously, we've seen better numbers than that as we're coming out of it."

Though I will remind you, we had a very large conversion deal in CALA last year, where they -- the conversions entered the pipeline quickly and then actually opened. So it can vary. 
The other kind of disproportionate pipeline area is Middle East Africa, where it's currently about 4% of our rooms, but it's about 9% of our pipeline.

Lucky to have got to know her. I really wanted to just ask you a little bit more about what you're seeing and hearing from owners around wage pressure and kind of where that stands, if people are seeing any sort of let up in that? 
And then just, Tony, in general, as I'm sure you have the risks or the fears around recession have been heightened significantly as if that goes through this tightening phase. I'm just wondering if you have any kind of feedback from the corporates or whomever that you're speaking with around heightened concerns on that front?"

There's no doubt, if you remember, in the U.S., for us, the average hourly salary from January '21 to December of '21 was about a 10% increase. 
So I mean, there's no doubt that in certain markets, in certain hotels, places that to get the hiring done really did require some meaningful work. And what we are finding now that as frankly, the world returns to a bit more normal pace of everything from availability of child care to the government subsidies winding down to, frankly, people feeling more comfortable about being in the workplace, that we have had an easier time getting positions filled. And we're basically back to a position of being relatively consistent with pre-pandemic levels of open positions. I'm really talking about the U.S. here. 
No, I think certainly, as you've described, we do expect to continue to have strong pressures on the wage and benefit front. We've worked incredibly hard on scheduling and productivity measures to make sure that we're managing the hotels the best way we can with also providing great service to the guests. 
And so right now, we've been thrilled to see that even with RevPAR in our managed hotels that RevPAR is meaningfully down compared to '19, that our managed margins are similar. And we do expect to continue to see gains in occupancy as we move forward, which will be helpful. 
So we will keep some of these productivity gains, maybe 200 basis points-ish around the world to help us offset inflation. But we're really glad that we repriced our rooms every night in terms of ADR because there's no doubt that that's been a big help in managing these margins. 
And on the recession front, I guess I would point out 2 things. Number one, even though we saw a pretty tough GDP number come out recently, I think the factors behind it really point to actually a pretty strong economy. You've got really strong job additions in the U.S. You've got generally 2 jobs available for every person that's looking for a job. You've seen greater participation rates in chunks of the population. You've also seen that consumer spending continues to be really strong. 
And while the export markets for us were tough, I think in many respects, because of COVID in other parts of the world, they're really -- I think there's good reason to think that the U.S. economy will continue to march along. Now as we see what the Fed could do, that obviously could have a slowing impact. But we think there is still pent-up demand, and we believe that we'll continue to see strong demand for our hotels."

I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically, whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically, I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. 
There's a bit of a tug of war right now, I think, between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint, and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers, immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics, particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient, would suggest that, that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction are starting to win that tug of war a bit."

This is a fairly similar pattern to how we did it coming out of the Great Recession, which is to give ourselves time to see how the recovery is moving forward. 
So assuming that we continue to see the strength that we are seeing and that our bookings are showing, I would expect that we will obviously continue the dividend and fairly -- in fairly short order, get it back to the kind of payout levels that we had prior to the pandemic. 
Share repurchase is obviously the much more flexible part of our capital return strategy. And so there, we've got some gatekeepers. We really want to absolutely feel comfortable about the positioning in our 3 to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA range. That's an important part. 
And as I talked about in my comments, we're very close to that. And we will -- with the kind of cash generation that our business model has, we'll get there very quickly. But we do want to be squarely in that range and feel comfortable that with possible volatility, that we're in good shape to stay there. 
So I think you will see, as we've talked about, that assuming things continue as they are, I would expect that you will see both the dividend continue as well as the share repurchase. The timing of when we may have a dividend increase, David, is really all around the pace of acceleration, whether this pace of acceleration continues, whether it's different. I just think we need a little bit more time to feel comfortable because the one thing you know, once we raise that dividend, we want to make sure that we're comfortable to keep it there.

They were, again, roughly 40% coming from the U.S. and Canada. And frankly, that's only down -- so call that $40 million, that's only down from the high 50s millions in 2019, while RevPAR is obviously still down in the mid-teens for those hotels in the U.S. So it's a really impressive performance. 
In Q1 of 2019, 56% of the U.S. hotels paid in IMF. While, in Q1 this year, we're at 12%. So to your point, there is a way to go, and it obviously is -- they're much stronger in the luxury and resort hotels. It's a bit of a step function, where so many hotels have this jump from an owner's priority in the U.S. to then where they actually earned. 
And there's not -- I can't point to one particular kind of demarcation point that will tell you that we can jump. In the international, it is much more aligned with what happens with base fees because as you know there, with every dollar of profit, we get a percentage with -- without an owner's priority in many of the hotels. 
So in the U.S., obviously, the big weakness right now is still on the occupancy side, and that will help us, particularly in the large cities as we continue to see gains in the premium hotels in the big cities. But there's unfortunately not one particular place that says if we get to ADR of whatever it is or RevPAR that that's going to clinch it. 
But again, one of the points that I made during my comments, we're really pleased to see the margins being similar to 2019 levels. And we're hopeful that, that will continue for the rest of the year. That we're able to hold on to this kind of margin performance for the full year for these manageable service hotels in the U.S., and that will obviously get us more IMFs. 
If you remember, you can only recognize IMFs, as you look at your full year forecast. So that's one of the other things as we continue to move through the year. We'll have more visibility about the full year forecast for these hotels, which will also be helpful."

Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron-related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy ros",1339,"Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron-related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy rose to 64%, with ADR an impressive 5% above March of 2019.  
COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world, but as global vaccination rates increase, case counts decline and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe. Many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy, leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel.  
Leisure demand, which had already fully recovered during 2021, has further strengthened this year, with first quarter global leisure transient room nights more than 10% above 2019. Recovery of business transient and group demand is still lagging leisure, but as greater numbers of employees return to the office, demand has been rapidly improving.  
Additionally, day of the week trends continue to show that trips that blend leisure and business are on the rise. In March, in the U.S. and Canada, while Monday through Wednesday occupancy was down in the mid-teens, occupancy during the shoulder days, Thursday and Sunday, was down in the single digits and occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was nearly in line with March of 2019.  
While still below pre-pandemic room nights, cross-border travel demand is growing slowly as more countries around the world reopen their borders and lift travel restrictions. Cross-border guests accounted for 14% of global room nights in the first quarter, a gain of around 100 basis points compared to a quarter ago, but well below the 2019 share of 19%.  
In the U.S. and Canada, March RevPAR was within 4% of 2019. Occupancy topped 68% during the month and ADR accelerated to 6% over pre-pandemic levels. While the extent of RevPAR recovery still varies widely from city to city, overall, progress during the quarter was widespread across all chain scales as well as market types, that is primary, secondary and tertiary markets, RevPAR recovery saw a meaningful improvement in March versus the fourth quarter.  
Luxury was the standout in the quarter, with ADR a remarkable 27% above pre-pandemic rates. Group demand in the U.S. and Canada accelerated sharply during the first quarter. In March, group RevPAR was 16% below 2019 compared to down more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Growth in new bookings has contributed to a meaningful improvement in group pace for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, group revenue pays for the remainder of 2022 was down in the high single-digit range compared to 2019. We also expect additional short-term bookings to further boost group revenues. April was the eighth month in a row where in the year for the year group bookings exceeded 2019 levels.  
Importantly, our sales teams remain focused on driving ADR, which has continued to rise for new bookings. ADR for managed hotel bookings made in January was 3% above 2019 levels, while ADR for bookings made in March had risen to 12% above pre-pandemic levels.  
Business transient demand in the U.S. also gained momentum during the quarter. Recovery in March improved notably compared to the fourth quarter, with business transient room nights down 10% to 15%. Special corporate accounts, which tend to be larger companies, have recovered more slowly than smaller-sized businesses, which have now fully recovered. Special corporate new bookings strengthened in March and further advanced in April.  
Internationally, all regions, except for Greater China, experienced additional RevPAR recovery in March compared to the fourth quarter recovery. In the Middle East and Africa, where borders have been opened since late last year, first quarter performance was stellar, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. This was led by strength in the UAE from the World Expo in Dubai that ran from October of 2021 through March of this year.  
At the other end of the spectrum, in Greater China, where restrictions have been the most severe, RevPAR dropped significantly with the lockdown of several major cities, including Shanghai, late in the quarter. We are keeping a close eye on trends in Europe, but outside of Russia, the war in Ukraine has not yet impacted demand. Cancellations have been minimal. And as all countries in the region have removed or reduced travel restrictions, bookings across the rest of Europe have accelerated for spring and the summer high season.  
In Russia, we've closed our corporate offices and paused all future hotel development and new hotel openings. There are currently 23 properties opened in the country, though occupancies are modest. We continue to evaluate our operations in Russia, which represented well under 1% of our global fees in 2019.  
We are watching the horrific humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries with deep concern. And we're doing what we can to help those impacted in the region. I'm very proud of our teams that have been mobilizing to help those in need in numerous ways, including working with relief partners and housing refugees at Marriott properties in neighboring countries.  
The power of Marriott Bonvoy was, again, evident in the quarter, as we remain focused on strengthening our loyalty platform for our 164 million members. Of course, member engagement has risen as travel demand comes back, but there has also been a significant increase in members earning and using points outside of our hotels. Our Bonvoy members are interacting with us more through everyday spending, thanks to our collaborations with companies like Uber.  
We have also seen incredible global interest in and engagement with our Bonvoy co-brand cards, with new card acquisitions and card spend both up meaningfully year-over-year.  
The first quarter also marked our best quarter ever for direct digital bookings, which helped drive owner and franchisee profitability. Digital bookings were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019, partially driven by meaningfully higher downloads of our redesigned Bonvoy app, which were 70% above pre-pandemic levels.  
Turning to development. The number of deals presented at our monthly development committee meetings has continued to increase. We signed 124 deals globally through March of this year, a new first quarter record. Conversion activity remains a bright spot, given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system.  
Conversions accounted for 22% of room additions in the quarter. Despite construction time lines having lengthened a bit so far this year due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we expect openings to ramp up each quarter in 2022. Average construction time lines are currently just over 2 years for limited service properties and remain longer for full-service properties.  
Looking ahead, we still expect full year gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S.  
With financing starting to ease a bit, the industry has seen a notable ramp-up in new construction starts in the first quarter, but they are still well below 2019 levels. However, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our momentum around conversions and the largest pipeline in the industry.  
In closing, I feel extremely optimistic about our future. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands and over 8,000 properties worldwide, our invaluable Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our numerous growth opportunities and the best associates in the business, I believe Marriott is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued recovery ahead.  
I will now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees, once again, showed meaningful growth, totaling a $170 million in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year credit card fees.  
Incentive management fees, or IMF, are rebounding nicely and reached $102 million in the quarter. They comprise 13% of total gross fees, an acceleration from 7% in the year ago quarter, driven in part by strong performance at our U.S. and Canada hotels. Over 55% of our IMFs were earned at our industry-leading luxury properties. IMFs from our comp luxury hotels were 10% above the first quarter of 2019, while IMFs from our comp luxury resorts were up more than 60% over the same time frame. Roughly 60% of IMFs were earned at our international properties during the quarter.  
Our owned and leased portfolio, again, generated positive profits, totaling $44 million in the quarter due to international government subsidies and improved results at hotels in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America and Europe. G&A and other expense totaled $208 million in the first quarter due to timing and lower travel costs as a result of the Omicron variant. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $759 million, down only 8% compared to the first quarter of 2019.  
We remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while also containing operating costs. Our U.S. managed hotels profit margins were nearly back to 2019 levels in the first quarter, despite RevPAR down 16% compared to 2019. While industry staffing challenges persist, primarily in certain U.S. markets, we've made great progress since last summer in successfully hiring for open positions. As always, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation, but we're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years.  
As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we're very pleased with the positive momentum and demand we're seeing across customer segments in the vast majority of markets around the world. With the recent widespread easing of travel restrictions in many regions, employees returning to the office in greater numbers, increasingly positive travel sentiment and our team's focus on ADR, we're even more optimistic than we were a quarter ago that we'll see meaningful additional global RevPAR recovery this year, assuming no major change in the global economic environment or the behavior of the virus.  
There's still too much volatility given uncertainty around travel restrictions in countries like China and a high reliance on cross-border guests across our international markets to give global RevPAR or specific earnings guidance. But we do have more visibility in our largest market, the U.S. and Canada, which is almost entirely dependent on domestic travelers.  
In the U.S. and Canada, occupancy and ADR continued to improve in April, and we estimate that RevPAR fully recovered to 2019 levels for the month. We're extremely pleased to reach this milestone roughly 2 years after the pandemic began.  
While demand still varies considerably across hotel types and markets, given current booking and ADR trends, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada to be roughly flat to 2019 in the remaining quarters of 2022. Internationally, we expect continued RevPAR recovery across markets that have not yet fully recovered, though the levels of progress will vary widely across regions.  
To further help with your modeling, let me share some additional color. At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2022 RevPAR versus full year 2021 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees.  
For the full year, interest expense net is still anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is now expected to be around 24%. G&A and other expenses are still anticipated to be $860 million to $880 million, well below 2019. We still anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters.  
We could now see loyalty be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. With the meaningful pickup in demand, we've seen an increase in redemption activity and expect this trend to persist.  
We've made meaningful progress in driving cash flow, managing expenses and improving our credit profile. Given this progress as well as the strength of our business and our confidence and our outlook improving further, we're very pleased to be resuming capital returns to shareholders sooner than we had anticipated. With leverage close to our target ratio of between 3x and 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, we're resuming our dividend at $0.30 a share in the second quarter, the first dividend in 2 years.  
We remain committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that increases shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Assuming the global demand environment continues to improve and that we are within our target leverage ratio range, we expect to resume share repurchases this year.  
Our business model has demonstrated terrific resilience, and I want to thank our teams all over the world for helping us navigate the challenges over the past 2 years. It's thrilling to see so many hotels full of guests again, and we're very optimistic about the future of travel and the future of Marriott International.

As you know, many of the development projects that we entertain in Greater China come to us when they are well under construction. And so one of the metrics we use to evaluate growth pace is intake of MOUs or LOIs, and we've seen pretty steady pace of MOU intake even during the impact of the zero COVID policy across China. 
We have seen some construction interruption as we've seen here in the U.S. But for the first time, we're starting to see some real traction on the conversion side, which has not historically been particularly active source of rooms growth across Greater China."

So I think, generally, as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years.

So I think, generally, as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years. And as you probably heard us say, we actually saw credit card fees in Q1 '22, up 26% compared to '19. So they really and obviously up a whole lot over last year as well. 
So it's a combination of 2 things, Stephen. One is that we continue to see overall credit card spend increase and then our new card acquisition growth has also been impressive. So I think as you continue to see that moving forward, that's a strength. 
The other thing is, obviously, we are a card that tends to be logged by people who love to travel. So there, again, as you see people returning to travel, I think that's also great incentive with all the Bonvoy points that they earned. So I think you'll continue to see that be a strong force in the growth in our fees this year. 
And as you think about the cash flow, there are 2 points that I'd make on working capital. One is that, generally speaking, as you remember, we are a negative working capital business overall. And as the company recovery continues. I think that trend will continue to show itself from the standpoint that our fees get paid so quickly, while it's not always the case that our payables have to be paid quite as quickly. So that will continue to help us on the working capital side. 
And as you pointed out, on loyalty, we have moved from where we thought it was a slight source of cash to a slight use of cash as a result of higher redemptions. I think you should expect as the year moves on that, that will continue, but that is our current forecast for the year that ties into these RevPAR numbers that we've talked about in the U.S."

I do think, as we talked about last quarter, the availability of debt financing has likely been the single biggest impediment to an acceleration of new construction, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. And as that flow of debt capital starts to free up a little bit, that's why I think we're seeing a parallel increase in construction starts.

So just when you think about that, that obviously can be someone going to see somebody where it's -- at a hotel that is not very full.

But I think overall, the best way to think about it is roughly 5% of total rooms."

And then just, Tony, in general, as I'm sure you have the risks or the fears around recession have been heightened significantly as if that goes through this tightening phase. I'm just wondering if you have any kind of feedback from the corporates or whomever that you're speaking with around heightened concerns on that front?"

There's no doubt, if you remember, in the U.S., for us, the average hourly salary from January '21 to December of '21 was about a 10% increase. 
So I mean, there's no doubt that in certain markets, in certain hotels, places that to get the hiring done really did require some meaningful work. And what we are finding now that as frankly, the world returns to a bit more normal pace of everything from availability of child care to the government subsidies winding down to, frankly, people feeling more comfortable about being in the workplace, that we have had an easier time getting positions filled. And we're basically back to a position of being relatively consistent with pre-pandemic levels of open positions. I'm really talking about the U.S. here. 
No, I think certainly, as you've described, we do expect to continue to have strong pressures on the wage and benefit front. We've worked incredibly hard on scheduling and productivity measures to make sure that we're managing the hotels the best way we can with also providing great service to the guests. 
And so right now, we've been thrilled to see that even with RevPAR in our managed hotels that, that RevPAR is meaningfully down compared to '19, that our managed margins are similar. And we do expect to continue to see gains in occupancy as we move forward, which will be helpful. 
So we will keep some of these productivity gains, maybe 200 basis points-ish around the world to help us offset inflation. But we're really glad that we repriced our rooms every night in terms of ADR because there's no doubt that that's been a big help in managing these margins. 
And on the recession front, I guess I would point out 2 things. Number one, even though we saw a pretty tough GDP number come out recently, I think the factors behind it really point to actually a pretty strong economy. You've got really strong job additions in the U.S. You've got generally 2 jobs available for every person that's looking for a job. You've seen greater participation rates in chunks of the population. You've also seen that consumer spending continues to be really strong. 
And while the export markets for us were tough, I think in many respects, because of COVID in other parts of the world, they're really -- I think there's good reason to think that the U.S. economy will continue to march along. Now as we see what the Fed could do, that obviously could have a slowing impact. But we think there is still pent-up demand, and we believe that we'll continue to see strong demand for our hotels."

I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically, whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically, I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. 
There's a bit of a tug of war right now, I think, between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint, and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers, immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics, particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient, would suggest that, that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction are starting to win that tug of war a bit."

This is a fairly similar pattern to how we did it coming out of the Great Recession, which is to give ourselves time to see how the recovery is moving forward. 
So assuming that we continue to see the strength that we are seeing and that our bookings are showing, I would expect that we will obviously continue the dividend and fairly -- in fairly short order, get it back to the kind of payout levels that we had prior to the pandemic. 
Share repurchase is obviously the much more flexible part of our capital return strategy. And so there, we've got some gatekeepers. We really want to absolutely feel comfortable about the positioning in our 3x to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA range. That's an important part. 
And as I talked about in my comments, we're very close to that. And we will -- with the kind of cash generation that our business model has, we'll get there very quickly. But we do want to be squarely in that range and feel comfortable that with possible volatility, that we're in good shape to stay there. 
So I think you will see, as we've talked about, that assuming things continue as they are, I would expect that you will see both the dividend continue as well as the share repurchase. The timing of when we may have a dividend increase, David, is really all around the pace of acceleration, whether this pace of acceleration continues, whether it's different. I just think we need a little bit more time to feel comfortable because the one thing you know, once we raise that dividend, we want to make sure that we're comfortable to keep it there. We're very comfortable with the $0.30, and we'll be looking at it literally every single month as we move forward."

They were, again, roughly 40% coming from the U.S. and Canada. And frankly, that's only down -- so call that $40 million, that's only down from the high 50s millions in 2019, while RevPAR is obviously still down in the mid-teens for those hotels in the U.S. So it's a really impressive performance. 
In Q1 of 2019, 56% of the U.S. hotels paid in IMF. While, in Q1 this year, we're at 12%. So to your point, there is a way to go, and it obviously is -- they're much stronger in the luxury and resort hotels. It's a bit of a step function, where so many hotels have this jump from an owner's priority in the U.S. to then where they actually earned. 
And there's not -- I can't point to one particular kind of demarcation point that will tell you that we can jump. In the international, it is much more aligned with what happens with base fees because as you know there, with every dollar of profit, we get a percentage with -- without an owner's priority in many of the hotels. 
So in the U.S., obviously, the big weakness right now is still on the occupancy side, and that will help us, particularly in the large cities as we continue to see gains in the premium hotels in the big cities. But there's unfortunately not one particular place that says if we get to ADR of whatever it is or RevPAR that that's going to clinch it. 
But again, one of the points that, that I made during my comments, we're really pleased to see the margins being similar to 2019 levels. And we're hopeful that, that will continue for the rest of the year. That we're able to, to hold on to this kind of margin performance for the full year for these manageable service hotels in the U.S., and that will obviously get us more IMFs. 
If you remember, you can only recognize IMFs, as you look at your full year forecast. So that's one of the other things as we continue to move through the year. We'll have more visibility about the full year forecast for these hotels, which will also be helpful."

We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of A",1173,"Thank you, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of Asia Pacific had more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, leading to June global RevPAR 1% above 2019. Worldwide occupancy for the month rose to 71%, just 5 percentage points below prepandemic levels with global ADR an impressive 8% over the same month in 2019. 
Demand across all customer segments improved during the quarter. Record leisure demand strengthened further with second quarter global leisure transient room nights 1% above the 2019 second quarter. 
Group demand experienced the greatest acceleration. In the U.S. and Canada, Group RevPAR had nearly fully recovered in June down just 1% to 2019 compared to down 17% in March. Group revenue pace for the back half of the year has also continued to improve. June in the year fourth year new bookings were up 50% compared to those bookings in June of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group RevPAR for the remainder of 2022 was pacing just a few percentage points down to 2019. We expect additional short-term bookings will further bolster group revenues, which could lead to second half group RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada being even to even up slightly compared to 2019. 
Our sales team remains focused on driving group average rate, which has been steadily rising for new bookings. At our hotels in the U.S. and Canada, ADR for in the year for the year group bookings made in January was just above 2019 levels. But by June, the rate had risen to up 16%. Business transient demand also strengthened, albeit at a more moderate pace as workers return to the office in greater numbers. In the U.S. June business transient room nights were 9% below the same month in 2019 versus down about 20% in the first quarter. 
Day of the week trends in the U.S. and Canada suggest that travelers are continuing to combine leisure and business streams. While occupancy midweek has continued to recover, in June, Monday through Wednesday occupancy was still around 10 percentage points below 2019. Occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was fully recovered, and occupancy on Thursdays and Sundays, typically known as shoulder nights, was close to 2019 levels. 
With nearly all major countries around the world having opened their borders rising cross-border travel was another key driver of the solid recovery during the quarter. However, cross-border travel is still not fully back to prepandemic levels. So there is still additional upside, especially from Greater China, where stringent travel restrictions remain in place. 
While we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. On the contrary, the pent-up demand for all types of [ travel ], the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment and the lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders in most markets around the world are fueling travel. And as Leeny will discuss, we expect to see continued RevPAR recovery through the end of the year. 
As travelers get back on the road in increasing numbers, our 169 million Bonvoy members are more actively engaging with our powerful loyalty platform. Monthly active users of our app, digital visits and direct digital bookings, which help drive the owner and franchisee profitability, all reached new highs in June. Additionally, more members are earning and using points outside of a hotel stay as a result of our focus on enhancing the platform through numerous collaborations. 
The number of Bonvoy co-brand credit card holders is climbing globally with card acquisitions and total card spend both hitting record levels in the second quarter. Remarkably, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from the end of 2019 through the end of the second quarter this year. In July, we introduced a new credit card in China, and the initial response has been tremendous. 
Turning to the development front. The pace of deal activity continues to pick up. In the second quarter, we signed another 135 deals, a second quarter record following a record first quarter. Additionally, despite supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and rising interest rates, the number of deals falling out of the pipeline remains below historical levels. 
Interest in conversions remains particularly strong, given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales as owners continue to seek out the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott portfolio. Conversions represented 30% of room signings in the quarter. One win to highlight is a recent landmark agreement for 8 hotels in Vietnam with Vinpearl, a new owner to our system. The deal includes 6 conversion hotels that are expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. 
Conversions also represented 25% of the roughly 17,000 rooms added to our system in the quarter. While construction time lines have lengthened a bit this year in most markets due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we still expect the number of room additions to ramp in the second half of the year. For the full year, gross additions are still anticipated to approach 5%. 
Given our announcement several weeks ago that we are suspending all operations in Russia, we now expect a 1.5% to 2% deletion rate for 2022. While our expectation for deletions outside of Russia remains at 1% to 1.5%, the deletion of 6,500 rooms in the country represents almost 0.5 percentage point. Now as a reminder, fees from Russia represented well under 0.5% of global fees in 2019. We have not been recognizing fees from Russia for many months now, and the financial impact of these rooms leaving is de minimis. So our net rooms growth for 2022 could now be 3% to 3.5% or 3.5% to 4% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. 
We remain confident that, over the next several years, we will return to our prepandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. The timing will largely depend on when new construction starts, which have trailed well below 2019 levels for the last 2 years really begin to accelerate, particularly here in the U.S. Construction time lines in the U.S. are currently just over 2 years for a limited service hotel and longer for full-service properties. 
Looking ahead with the largest footprint in the industry, strong builder affinity for our brands and the improving global travel environment, I am bullish about the company's future growth prospects for development and for the company overall. I want to take a moment and thank all of our associates around the world. Their commitment to taking care of our guests has helped produce our outstanding results, and I'm so very proud of their dedication and resilience. And now I'll turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply, and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter.

Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply, and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global RevPAR was down only 3% compared to prepandemic levels. .
Looking at the regions. In the U.S. and Canada, RevPAR came in ahead of our expectations largely due to stronger-than-anticipated growth in ADR and group demand. Compared to 2019, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was up 1% in the quarter and up 3% in June. ADR has improved each month this year, reaching 9% above prepandemic levels in June. Occupancy further strengthened from the first to the second quarter on both an absolute basis and versus prepandemic levels. June occupancy of 76% was within 4 percentage points of the same month in 2019. 
In June, U.S. and Canada RevPAR more than fully recovered across all market types, primary, secondary and tertiary, for the first time since the pandemic began. It has been very encouraging to see demand come back so powerfully in major cities like New York, where RevPAR increased 7% versus June 2019. With orders opened in Europe, the room nights from international guests more than doubled in the region from the first quarter to the second. With this strong return of international travel, Europe has experienced the swiftest RevPAR recovery of all of our regions this year. RevPAR in Europe topped 2019 levels in June, a remarkable 57 percentage point increase from January. 
Cross-border travel also helped drive strong second quarter results in the Middle East and Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America area. Second quarter RevPAR rose 16% in EMEA and 13% in CALA compared to 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, saw rapid RevPAR improvement during the second quarter as the region is now mostly open with India and Australia more than fully recovered. Second quarter RevPAR was down 22% compared to 2019 given the lack of travelers from Greater China and the fact that rigorous travel restrictions remain in place in Japan, one of our largest markets in the region. 
Greater China continues to lag the recovery of other regions due to its strict 0 COVID policy. RevPAR during the quarter declined more than 50% compared to 2019 as a result of the lockdowns in many cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. 
Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter driven by higher RevPAR, rooms growth and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. Those fees totaled $204 million in the second quarter driven largely by growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose a remarkable 38% year-over-year. 
Incentive management fees, or IMF, increased meaningfully in the quarter, reaching $135 million. Over half of our IMFs came from U.S. and Canada, where we earned more IMFs than we did in the second quarter of 2019. 
At the hotel level, working closely with our owners and franchisees to contain operating costs while delivering superior customer service remains the key area of focus. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels were 3 percentage points higher than 2019 levels in the second quarter despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. We are keeping an eye on wages and benefits as industry staffing challenges persist in certain markets, yet we remain optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. 
G&A and other expenses totaled $231 million in the second quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals as well as increased travel expense. With COVID now essentially endemic, global borders overwhelmingly open and business somewhat more predictable, we're providing guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The full details are in our press release. There is still a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty in our outlook, especially as it relates to Greater China, but we are encouraged by the positive momentum in demand across customer segments and robust ADRs in the vast majority of markets around the world. 
We expect the global RevPAR recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and ADR compared to 2019 in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. On a worldwide basis compared to 2019, we could see RevPAR flat to up 3% in the third quarter and down 6% to down 3% for the full year. Compared to 2021, global RevPAR in the third quarter could be up in the mid-30% range, and for the full year, it could be up around 50%. 
For the full year, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $890 million to $900 million due to higher compensation accruals as well as travel expenses but still well below [indiscernible] G&A. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, above our prior full year peak in 2019. We now expect full year investment spending of $600 million to $650 million. Our guidance now includes roughly $200 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. Loyalty is still expected to be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. 
At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was in the low end of our targeted range of 3 to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter and have already bought 448 million of stock as of July 29, in addition to paying our dividend in the second quarter at $0.30 per share. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will make investments that enhance our growth and increase shareholder value while returning any excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
Given our outlook for further global recovery and our powerful business model that is generating significant cash beyond our investment needs, we expect to return more than $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This level of capital returns is included in the guidance we have provided today. 
Looking ahead, I'm very optimistic about our future. Marriott is incredibly well positioned given the breadth and depth of our unparalleled global portfolio, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and the best team in the business. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And then the last thing I would say is all of those are comments about demand levels. We continue to see really encouraging pricing power on the leisure side as well.

I think to really see acceleration, and this is an industry comment as much as a Marriott comment, particularly in the U.S., you have seen a slowing in construction starts. Just over the last quarter, we have seen that start to tick up, although not to levels we saw in 2019. But I think we will do our best to continue to drive conversion volume and do everything we can to get shovels in the ground.

As demand and performance have recovered, there is the potential that there may be more assets in play, number one. 
Number two, the portfolio of conversion-friendly brands we have, particularly our soft brands, Tribute, Autograph and Luxury Collection is more robust than we've ever armed our transactors in any other recessionary environment.

So it's definitely improved. It is not back to where we were in '19 in terms of the labor shortage, but we're definitely seeing steady improvement, and the wage increases have slowed.

One of the easiest ways to think about luxury is that rate has continued to stay very strong. But what we've also seen is that the markets that were previously weaker, like a New York or San Francisco, the luxury hotels in those markets are now filling in. They, on average, are not necessarily quite as high as in some of the resort markets. So it actually makes it look, on a blended basis, like the gains in ADR and luxury are not as strong, while the reality is just the opposite, that they continue to be quite strong. .
I think one of the most encouraging things to see is that the overall luxury portfolio is continuing to gain in both occ and rate. And then as Tony was talking about earlier, I think it's also particularly encouraging to see the premium market, the Marriotts, the Sheratons, the Renaissances in kind of all markets really recovering now more in the second quarter meaningfully than they were in the first quarter. 
So we really don't expect that we are depending on continued additional ADR gains in luxury through the rest of this year, but we do continue to see really strong demand.

They're just wishing for the good old days where they had maximum flexibility.

As you may recall from some prior earnings calls, in the depths of the pandemic, we suspended some of those quality metrics. Those are all back in place now, brand, standard, audits, guest surveys. And the teams -- we just went through our quarterly business reviews. All of our teams around the world are keenly focused on driving intent to return. And we're pretty encouraged. And I think it's reflected in the manner in which our most loyal Bonvoy customers continue to engage. Our top tier within Bonvoy, the ambassador tier, has remained very active. 96% of our ambassadors had at least one stay or points transaction in '21, they averaged about 100 nights, and we see those metrics improving as well.

And I think it's reasonable to expect in the coming quarters that we would start to get back to the trend line we saw prepandemic of the total volume of OTA contribution moderating. 
I think your first question was really more around mix by segment. Back in '19 in round numbers, about 40% of our business was leisure. 37% was business transient. 20% was group and 4% was contract. In the second quarter, business transient had risen to about 32%. Leisure transient was 43%. group was 21%, and contract was pretty steady at 4%. 
But remember, the leisure segment was already our most rapidly growing segment even in 2019 before the pandemic did. And we continue to see -- expect to see leisure to grow rapidly.

But we are not back to the same level of cross-border travel. Obviously, particularly with Asia Pacific and Greater China still being very much domestic travel based. 
The thing I did find interesting in Q2 in the U.S. was that we were pretty close to being back to the number of international -- the percentage of international nights. We were pre pandemic at 5%. And in Q2, we were at 4% coming from cross-border travel. I think the biggest shift that you saw was obviously partly a function of opening kind of more comfort travel and then the strong dollar.

We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of A",1172,"Thank you, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of Asia Pacific had more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, leading to June global RevPAR 1% above 2019. Worldwide occupancy for the month rose to 71%, just 5 percentage points below prepandemic levels with global ADR an impressive 8% over the same month in 2019.  
Demand across all customer segments improved during the quarter. Record leisure demand strengthened further with second quarter global leisure transient room nights 14% above the 2019 second quarter.  
Group demand experienced the greatest acceleration. In the U.S. and Canada, Group RevPAR had nearly fully recovered in June down just 1% to 2019 compared to down 17% in March. Group revenue pace for the back half of the year has also continued to improve. June in the year, for the year, new bookings were up 50% compared to those bookings in June of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group RevPAR for the remainder of 2022 was pacing just a few percentage points down to 2019. We expect additional short-term bookings will further bolster group revenues, which could lead to second half group RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada being even to even up slightly compared to 2019.  
Our sales team remains focused on driving group average rate, which has been steadily rising for new bookings. At our hotels in the U.S. and Canada, ADR for in the year, for the year group bookings made in January was just above 2019 levels. But by June, the rate had risen to up 16%. Business transient demand also strengthened, albeit at a more moderate pace as workers return to the office in greater numbers. In the U.S. June business transient room nights were 9% below the same month in 2019 versus down about 20% in the first quarter.  
Day of the week trends in the U.S. and Canada suggest that travelers are continuing to combine leisure and business streams. While occupancy midweek has continued to recover, in June, Monday through Wednesday occupancy was still around 10 percentage points below 2019. Occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was fully recovered, and occupancy on Thursdays and Sundays, typically known as shoulder nights, was close to 2019 levels.  
With nearly all major countries around the world having opened their borders rising cross-border travel was another key driver of the solid recovery during the quarter. However, cross-border travel is still not fully back to prepandemic levels. So there is still additional upside, especially from Greater China, where stringent travel restrictions remain in place.  
While we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. On the contrary, the pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment and the lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders in most markets around the world are fueling travel. And as Leeny will discuss, we expect to see continued RevPAR recovery through the end of the year.  
As travelers get back on the road in increasing numbers, our 169 million Bonvoy members are more actively engaging with our powerful loyalty platform. Monthly active users of our app, digital visits and direct digital bookings, which help drive the owner and franchisee profitability, all reached new highs in June. Additionally, more members are earning and using points outside of a hotel stay as a result of our focus on enhancing the platform through numerous collaborations.  
The number of Bonvoy co-brand credit card holders is climbing globally with card acquisitions and total card spend both hitting record levels in the second quarter. Remarkably, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from the end of 2019 through the end of the second quarter this year. In July, we introduced a new credit card in China, and the initial response has been tremendous.  
Turning to the development front. The pace of deal activity continues to pick up. In the second quarter, we signed another 135 deals, a second quarter record following a record first quarter. Additionally, despite supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and rising interest rates, the number of deals falling out of the pipeline remains below historical levels.  
Interest in conversions remains particularly strong, given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales as owners continue to seek out the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott portfolio. Conversions represented 30% of room signings in the quarter.  
One win to highlight is a recent landmark agreement for 8 hotels in Vietnam with Vinpearl, a new owner to our system. The deal includes 6 conversion hotels that are expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. Conversions also represented 25% of the roughly 17,000 rooms added to our system in the quarter. While construction time lines have lengthened a bit this year in most markets due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we still expect the number of room additions to ramp in the second half of the year.  
For the full year, gross additions are still anticipated to approach 5%.  
Given our announcement several weeks ago that we are suspending all operations in Russia, we now expect a 1.5% to 2% deletion rate for 2022. While our expectation for deletions outside of Russia remains at 1% to 1.5%, the deletion of 6,500 rooms in the country represents almost 0.5 percentage point. Now as a reminder, fees from Russia represented well under 0.5% of global fees in 2019. We have not been recognizing fees from Russia for many months now, and the financial impact of these rooms leaving is de minimis. So our net rooms growth for 2022 could now be 3% to 3.5% or 3.5% to 4% before factoring in the deletions in Russia.  
We remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our prepandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. The timing will largely depend on when new construction starts, which have trailed well below 2019 levels for the last 2 years really begin to accelerate, particularly here in the U.S. Construction time lines in the U.S. are currently just over 2 years for a limited service hotel and longer for full-service properties.  
Looking ahead with the largest footprint in the industry, strong builder affinity for our brands and the improving global travel environment, I am bullish about the company's future growth prospects for development and for the company overall. I want to take a moment and thank all of our associates around the world. Their commitment to taking care of our guests has helped produce our outstanding results, and I'm so very proud of their dedication and resilience. And now I'll turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail."
31148,1790257381,2612076,"Marriott International, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2022",2022-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony. Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply, and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global Rev",1063,"Thank you, Tony. Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply, and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global RevPAR was down only 3% compared to prepandemic levels. . 
Looking at the regions. In the U.S. and Canada, RevPAR came in ahead of our expectations largely due to stronger-than-anticipated growth in ADR and group demand. Compared to 2019, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was up 1% in the quarter and up 3% in June. ADR has improved each month this year, reaching 9% above prepandemic levels in June.  
Occupancy further strengthened from the first to the second quarter on both an absolute basis and versus prepandemic levels. June occupancy of 76% was within 4 percentage points of the same month in 2019.  
In June, U.S. and Canada RevPAR more than fully recovered across all market types, primary, secondary and tertiary for the first time since the pandemic began. It has been very encouraging to see demand come back so powerfully in major cities like New York, where RevPAR increased 7% versus June 2019. With orders opened in Europe, the room nights from international guests more than doubled in the region from the first quarter to the second. With this strong return of international travel, Europe has experienced the swiftest RevPAR recovery of all of our regions this year. RevPAR in Europe topped 2019 levels in June, a remarkable 57 percentage point increase from January.  
Cross-border travel also helped drive strong second quarter results in the Middle East and Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America area. Second quarter RevPAR rose 16% in EMEA and 13% in CALA compared to 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, saw rapid RevPAR improvement during the second quarter as the region is now mostly open with India and Australia more than fully recovered. Second quarter RevPAR was down 22% compared to 2019 given the lack of travelers from Greater China and the fact that rigorous travel restrictions remain in place in Japan, one of our largest markets in the region.  
Greater China continues to lag the recovery of other regions due to its strict zero COVID policy. RevPAR during the quarter declined more than 50% compared to 2019 as a result of the lockdowns in many cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.  
Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter driven by higher RevPAR, rooms growth and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. Those fees totaled $204 million in the second quarter driven largely by growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose a remarkable 38% year-over-year.  
Incentive management fees, or IMF, increased meaningfully in the quarter, reaching $135 million. Over half of our IMFs came from U.S. and Canada, where we earned more IMFs than we did in the second quarter of 2019. At the hotel level, working closely with our owners and franchisees to contain operating costs while delivering superior customer service remains the key area of focus. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels were 3 percentage points higher than 2019 levels in the second quarter despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. We are keeping an eye on wages and benefits as industry staffing challenges persist in certain markets, yet we remain optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years.  
G&A and other expenses totaled $231 million in the second quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals as well as increased travel expense. With COVID now essentially endemic, global borders overwhelmingly open and business somewhat more predictable, we're providing guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The full details are in our press release. There is still a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty in our outlook, especially as it relates to Greater China, but we are encouraged by the positive momentum in demand across customer segments and robust ADRs in the vast majority of markets around the world.  
We expect the global RevPAR recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and ADR compared to 2019 in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. On a worldwide basis compared to 2019, we could see RevPAR flat to up 3% in the third quarter and down 6% to down 3% through the full year. Compared to 2021, global RevPAR in the third quarter could be up in the mid-30% range, and for the full year, it could be up around 50%.  
For the full year, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $890 million to $900 million due to higher compensation accruals as well as travel expenses but still well below [Audio Gap] G&A. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, above our prior full year peak in 2019. We now expect full year investment spending of $600 million to $650 million. Our guidance now includes roughly $200 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. Loyalty is still expected to be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies.  
At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was in the low end of our targeted range of 3 to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter and have already bought 448 million of stock as of July 29, in addition to paying our dividend in the second quarter at $0.30 per share.  
Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will make investments that enhance our growth and increase shareholder value while returning any excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating.  
Given our outlook for further global recovery and our powerful business model that is generating significant cash beyond our investment needs, we expect to return more than $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This level of capital returns is included in the guidance we have provided today.  
Looking ahead, I'm very optimistic about our future. Marriott is incredibly well positioned given the breadth and depth of our unparalleled global portfolio, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and the best team in the business. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So it's not that different for '23 versus a quarter ago except from what we're seeing in the quarter for the quarter, and even in the back half of '22, we're seeing some really great fill-in business that has got us pretty close to '19 levels where we could end up actually exceeding '19 levels in the back half of this year."

Number one, unlike some conventional downturns we've experienced in the past, where early in the downturn, you saw a lot of distress, the impact to our business was so severe that you saw the lenders being much more creative than accommodating with owners. So you didn't necessarily see a flood of distressed assets changing hands in the market. As demand and performance have recovered, there is the potential that there may be more assets in play, number one.  
Number two, the portfolio of conversion-friendly brands we have, particularly our soft brands, Tribute, Autograph and Luxury Collection is more robust than we've ever armed our transactors in any other recessionary environment. And I combine those 2 factors, and it drives my bullishness about that trajectory."

And we hear anecdotally from our corporate clients. We're seeing more and more return to the office, which is driving business demand.

And one of the things that I think is interesting is to look at the positions that we're trying to fill if, for example, normal staffing levels were that we were trying to fill the final 95% to 100% of the positions we needed at the hotel level. Right now, we're at 93%. 
So it's definitely improved. It is not back to where we were in '19 in terms of the labor shortage, but we're definitely seeing steady improvement, and the wage increases have slowed. Outside the U.S., it's much more varied. It really depends on the particular market.

One of the easiest ways to think about luxury is that rate has continued to stay very strong. But what we've also seen is that the markets that were previously weaker, like a New York or San Francisco, the luxury hotels in those markets are now filling in. They, on average, are not necessarily quite as high as in some of the resort markets. So it actually makes it look, on a blended basis, like the gains in ADR and luxury are not as strong, while the reality is just the opposite, that they continue to be quite strong. .
I think one of the most encouraging things to see is that the overall luxury portfolio is continuing to gain in both occ and rate. And then as Tony was talking about earlier, I think it's also particularly encouraging to see the premium market, the Marriotts, the Sheratons, the Renaissances in kind of all markets really recovering now more in the second quarter meaningfully than they were in the first quarter. 
So we really don't expect that we are depending on continued additional ADR gains in luxury through the rest of this year, but we do continue to see really strong demand.

We're not quite back to where we were pre pandemic, but we have made meaningful and steady progress on those metrics. 
As you may recall from some prior earnings calls, in the depths of the pandemic, we suspended some of those quality metrics. Those are all back in place now, brand, standard, audits, guest surveys. And the teams -- we just went through our quarterly business reviews. All of our teams around the world are keenly focused on driving intent to return. And we're pretty encouraged. And I think it's reflected in the manner in which our most loyal Bonvoy customers continue to engage. Our top tier within Bonvoy, the ambassador tier, has remained very active. 96% of our ambassadors had at least one stay or points transaction in '21, they averaged about 100 nights, and we see those metrics improving as well.

And I think it's reasonable to expect in the coming quarters that we would start to get back to the trend line we saw prepandemic of the total volume of OTA contribution moderating. 
I think your first question was really more around mix by segment. Back in '19 in round numbers, about 40% of our business was leisure. 37% was business transient. 20% was group and 4% was contract. In the second quarter, business transient had risen to about 32%. Leisure transient was 43%. Group was 21%, and contract was pretty steady at 4%. 
But remember, the leisure segment was already our most rapidly growing segment even in 2019 before the pandemic hit. And we continue to see -- expect to see leisure to grow rapidly.

But we are not back to the same level of cross-border travel. Obviously, particularly with Asia Pacific and Greater China still being very much domestic travel based. 
The thing I did find interesting in Q2 in the U.S. was that we were pretty close to being back to the number of international -- the percentage of international nights. We were pre pandemic at 5%. And in Q2, we were at 4% coming from cross-border travel. I think the biggest shift that you saw was obviously partly a function of opening kind of more comfort travel and then the strong dollar.

The only other thing I will point out is that August is typically a seasonally quieter months for us in group just because of the realities of family vacations and people not being in school.

Quarter rose above 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began, up nearly 2%. RevPAR compared to 2019 improved sequentially from the second quarter in every region around the world. Global occupancy rose to 69% and while ADR outpaced by 2019, excuse me, by a remarkable 10%. Compared to prepandemic levels, worldwide RevPAR in September reached a new monthly high watermark, increasing more than 4% or nearly 7%, excluding Greater China. During the quarter, leisure demand remained strong, well above 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, full-service group revenue for the quarter showed continued growth, ending up 3% over the same quarter in 2019. The Fourth quarter full-service group revenue is currently pacing up 4%, but is likely to improve further given the strong last-minute group bookings that we've seen all year. The trend towards last-minute bookings has led to meaningful compression in pricing power, helping group ADR for new bookings rise each quarter this year. 
At our managed hotels in the U.S. ADR for in the year 4 year group bookings made in the third quarter rose 17% compared to same year bookings made in the 20,193rd quarter. a significant jump from the 6% increase we saw in the first quarter. ADR for group bookings made in the third quarter for 2023 outpaced 20,193rd quarter bookings for events in 2000 by 24%. Business transient demand also continued to improve during the quarter, although it still lags 2019 levels. Third quarter business transient room nights in the U.S. and Canada were 11% below 2019. We are currently in the midst of our special corporate negotiations for 2023 and are very pleased with how they're progressing. After 2 years of holding rates steady, the early results look positive for at least high single-digit year-over-year rate growth. 
Third quarter day of the week trends continue to suggest that travelers are combining leisure and business trips. In fact, the average length of a transient business trip has increased meaningfully, and year-to-date is up more than 15% compared to 2019. With borders reopened in most countries around the world, rising cross-border travel helped spur demand during the quarter, especially in Europe and in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region. Cross-border guests accounted for 15% of our global room nights in the third quarter. an uptick from 12% in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, 18% of travel to our properties was from cross-border guests. So we anticipate additional upside from international travel especially from Greater China once stringent travel restrictions are relaxed. 
Given rapidly rising interest rates and growing concerns about a possible global recession, we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends. There is no doubt that the hospitality industry is impacted by economic cycles. And with transient booking windows averaging only about 3 weeks trends could change relatively quickly. However, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. In fact, we've seen just the opposite, booking trends remain very healthy. Given sustained high levels of employment, consumer trends prioritizing experiences versus goods, pent-up travel demand and a high level of consumer savings, travel spending has been incredibly resilient. In October, demand remains strong across our regions, with the exception of Greater China, where trends are still evolve. Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program grew to 173 million members at the end of the third quarter. The program achieved record penetration levels in the quarter reaching 60% in the U.S. and Canada and 53% globally. Members also continue to engage with our co-brand credit cards, which had another solid quarter. After recently making significant enhancements by adding new benefits to many of our U.S. cards, sign-ups have well exceeded expectations. This led to record new cardholder acquisitions as well as record spending for the first 9 months of this year. We also introduced 2 mid-tier cards at the end of September, which should help drive strong growth going forward. While much smaller fee contributors than our U.S. co-brand cards, we have similarly seen record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spend. 
This has been particularly driven by China, where we've had great traction after launching our first cards there in July. Our Bonvoy members have been increasingly interacting with the platform through our direct digital channels. which helps boost owner and franchisee profitability. Since 2019, our share of room nights booked through direct digital channels has increased more than 5 percentage points to 38% while our distribution through OTAs has risen by less than 1 percentage point to 12%. The power of Bonvoy in our direct channels has also been evident in our latest offering, the Ritz-Carlton Yacht and which made its inaugural voyage from Barcelona last month. Remarkably, around 2/3 of all bookings for this incredible brand extension have been through direct channels, which is many times above the rates most cruise companies experience. Additionally, Bonvoy members account for more than half of the Yacht bookings. We look forward to more ships joining the portfolio in the future. 
Shifting to the development front, our pipeline grew for the fourth quarter in a row, totaling more than 502,000 rooms by the end of the third pool. Signing activity in the quarter remained healthy in most regions of the world. Our development team continues to be laser focused on conversions, a particularly bright spot in the development story. Conversions represented 21% of room signings and 27% of remote openings in the quarter. We are very enthusiastic about the level of conversations on conversions, including for multiunit conversion opportunities. Outside Greater China, we were pleased to see new construction starts pick up nicely in the third quarter. While not yet back to 2019 levels, new construction starts in the U.S. reached the highest quarterly level since the pandemic began. For full year 2022, we now expect gross rooms growth of approximately 4.5% compared to our prior expectation of closer to 5%. The change is primarily a result of fewer expected openings in Greater China as the lockdowns there have extended construction time lines. The good news is that we have not seen deals in Greater China or in any of our regions falling out of the pipeline at a higher than usual rate. With just 2 months left in the year, we now expect deletions at the bottom end of our prior guidance. Deletions could be about 1.5% for 2022 or 1%, excluding the 50 basis point impact from our exit from Russia. 
So our net rooms growth for 2022 is likely to be around 3% or 3.5% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We're always looking at opportunities that help broaden the offering for our guests as well as our owners and franchisees. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the City Express brand portfolio. which is currently comprised of 152 hotels with over 17,000 rooms in the CALA region. We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential. Upon closing this transaction, we will immediately gain a significant foothold in this high-growth segment in CALA, while also becoming the largest hotel company in the region. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in CALA as well as other locations around the world. If the transaction closes before year-end, our 2022 gross rooms growth could be around 5.5%, and our net rooms growth could be approximately 4%. We really look forward to working with the City Express team. We expect solid rooms growth going forward, given the attractiveness of our portfolio of global brands, our powerful loyalty program, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline. While the exact timing will depend on how new construction starts trend from here, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth. 
Now before I turn it over to Leeny, I just want to recognize and thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment, passion and resilience. Leeny."

We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global Reports. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5% and above prepandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPA",1061,"Thank you, Tony. We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global Reports. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5% and above prepandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPAR for all market types primary, secondary and tertiary and all brand types from luxury through extended stay was more fully recovered for the first time. With the exception of Asia Pacific, our international regions posted incredibly strong RevPAR growth as restrictions across most countries fully lifted. Europe, in particular, benefited from a large increase in U.S. leisure demand, thanks to the strong dollar. Compared to 2019, third quarter RevPAR rose 6% in Europe, nearly 19% in the Middle East and Africa and nearly 18% in CALA. RevPAR is still lagging behind 2019 levels in Greater China and in our Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC region. Greater China improved the most in the quarter with RevPAR 23% below 2019, 30 percentage points better than a quarter ago. However, the recovery there remains uneven given China's renewed commitment to its strict 0 COVID policy. The good news is that we continue to see that when a market reopens for domestic travel after a lockdown, lodging demand rebounds very quickly. 
In APAC, South Korea joined India and Australia in crossing the full recovery mark but this was offset by Japan's borders remaining closed until the end of the quarter. Third quarter RevPAR in APAC was 14% below pre-pandemic levels an 8 percentage point improvement from a quarter ago. As we move through the fourth quarter, APAC is benefiting from a recovery in airlift in Japan's now open orders. Three quarter -- third quarter total gross fees of $1.1 billion rose 11% compared to 2019, exceeding the top end of our guidance. Growth was driven by RevPAR improvement and room additions as well as another quarter of strong non-RevPAR related fees. Those fees totaled $192 million in the third quarter largely aided by ongoing growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose 22% year-over-year. The strength of our industry-leading luxury portfolio also contributed significantly to fee growth in the quarter. Gross fees from our luxury properties were up 13% versus the same quarter in 2019 and even with Greater China's weaker performance, while our luxury properties account for 21% of our managed rooms, they contributed 34% of our total incentive management fees in the third quarter. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA also exceeded the high end of our guidance, outpacing the same quarter in 2019 by 9%. With the strong U.S. dollar, foreign exchange net of hedging, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $22 million in the quarter, some of which was included in our guidance a quarter ago. This negative currency translation was more than made up for by the positive impact from increased U.S. leisure travel abroad. We estimate net of our hedges, a 100 basis point change in the U.S. dollar could affect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA by less than $10 million. G&A and other expenses totaled $216 million in the third quarter, better than our guidance, largely reflecting lower-than-expected administrative costs and bad debt. At the hotel level, we remain focused on containing operating costs for our owners and franchisees while also delivering superior service to our guests. With ADR 15% above 2019 and our significant productivity enhancements, third quarter profit margins at our U.S. and Canada managed hotels were 2 full percentage points above 2019 levels despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Wage and benefit growth while still high, continued to moderate in the third quarter. 
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 guidance, the details of which are in our press release. As we head into the end of the year, we're very pleased with the strong continued momentum in our business. Group and transient bookings are showing further gains against 2019. In both the U.S. and Canada and internationally, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR compared to pre-pandemic levels to accelerate from the third quarter, even with anticipated weaker demand in Greater China. Compared to 2019, fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 4% to 6% in the U.S. and Canada, be down 2% to flat internationally and increase 2% to 4% globally. Worldwide fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 27% to 29% over fourth quarter 2021. We're still working through our 2023 budgets and recognize that there is heightened macro uncertainty. That said, we currently think 2023 global RevPAR could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison given the impact of the omicron variant in early 2022. 
For full year 2022, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $880 million to $890 million, slightly better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower bad debt expense. We're also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA of around $3.79 billion at the midpoint of the range which is 6% higher than our prior full peak year in 2019. Due to the timing of some capital expenditures for owned leased hotels and corporate systems as well as key money payments, we now expect full year investment spending of closer to $500 million, assuming the City Express transaction does not close in 2022. Strong spending on our credit cards is expected to result in loyalty being a slight source of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. Year-to-date, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, a significant increase of nearly $1.2 billion compared to the first 3 quarters of last year, a strong reminder of the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was excellent at the low end of investment grade targets. With our solid financial results and cash flow generations, we have already returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through October 31, and we now expect to return more than $2.7 billion to shareholders this year. 
In closing, we're incredibly proud of how well our business is performing and how resilient our business has proven to be. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?"

We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we're seeing in the debt markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S. is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shoes in the ground but we're quite encouraged about the consistency we've seen in the volume of under construction projects in our pipeline. In fact, we were looking at it over the last few days. As you saw in our release, we continue to have a little over 200,000 rooms under construction. It's actually the 20th straight quarter where we've had more than 200,000 rooms under construction globally. The market in China is most certainly where we're seeing the most challenges. The disproportionate share of our projects in the pipeline in China, in fact, about 60% are in the luxury and upper upscale tier, principally in primary markets, which are -- well, the combination of those quality tiers in those markets caused those projects to be the most significant fee generators, but they are more complex development projects, and it takes a little longer for them to get open in a market like China. But broadly, we continue to see really powerful interest in our portfolio of brands. And we're maybe most encouraged by the volume both on signings and openings in the conversion tier."

But I think we've got some things in our business that really do lead us to confidence about 2023, although we are not predicting per se a recession. We clearly believe there does continue to be pent-up travel demand, particularly in parts of the world where the borders are just opening. We're also seeing just generally a desire for travel and services as compared to goods, which we do see strongly in leisure. Also see, as we think about kind of the overall macro environment that there is pent-up savings for the consumer. So we'll have to see. But again, from where we sit right now and as we look into the booking trends into 2023. We continue to see strength across all the business segments, Shaun. And then the last thing I would say is the reality is our booking window is still short. So at roughly 3 weeks for transient bookings, things could change relatively quickly. But for the signs that we see right now, we feel good about 2023. Obviously, Q1 is a particularly hopeful item given we had Omicron in the first quarter of 2022."

And so I don't know that looking at that down 11% is particularly relevant. Even for Q4 this year, we're up 4%, and we think that will likely improve through the quarter, given the strength of short-term bookings and the trade that many of our customers are making for flexibility and they're willing to pay a higher rate. When I look deeper into what's on the books for 2023, room nights are down in the high teens, ADR is actually up close to about 10%. And then I think your second question was really about when that business is being booked. I guess I'll try to give you some 2022 data that is hopefully indicative of the trends we're seeing. About 50% of the group business we've seen year-to-date in 2022, was booked in the year for the year. That's about double what we saw prepandemic, where typically, we'd see about 25% of our total group volume being booked in the year for the year."

But whether it matches exactly RevPAR, we're not in a position to say specifically Obviously, when you look at compared to '19, those credit card fees have grown meaningfully more than hotel-related fees because of COVID and the steady growth in cardholders and credit card spend each and every year as we've moved through 2019. But I -- again, broadly speaking, we are looking at growth of non-RevPAR fees in 2023, both from credit cardholders as well as spend.

First of all, just from the dollar size, David, we were at $35 million of IMFs or about 1/3 from the U.S. and Canada, and that is pretty similar to what it was in Q3 '19. It was 39%. Now it was 26% of overall hotels in the U.S. and Canada are earning incentive fees in Q3 and 56% in '19. But it's important to break out full service from limited service because the reality is that we had a large portfolio back in '19 of managed limited service hotels, which, as you know, left our system over a year ago. So if you actually look at full service, we're actually at a slightly higher percentage of hotels earning IMFs in full service than we were in '19. And again, as we talked about before, in my comments that you saw house profit margins at our full-service hotels, up 200 basis points compared to '19 with our strong RevPAR performance and really strong efforts on the cost containment side. So I -- we feel good about what's going on. We've talked about, hoped for expected growth in RevPAR in 2023, both U.S. and internationally, which should bode well for continued progress on incentive fees. Obviously, wage and benefit growth is something we're keeping an eye on, which has moderated a bit, although it still reflects the fact that we're in an inflationary environment. And then the last thing I'll say is we've continued to see improvement in the large urban markets we've got a number of managed full-service hotels in the U.S. And we've seen nice progress as we moved into Q3 in some of those urban markets, and we expect them to continue on as we move into 2023 with that recovery."

So I would say, while we did things that on a temporary basis, like helped on the reducing reimbursable costs and helping with extensions on accounts receivable, they were all really overwhelmingly temporary things. And then also, if you remember, 85% of the things that we charge are based on top line revenues of the hotel. So they flex as the revenues go up and down. which is helpful to the hotel owners. I think you see things like what we've talked about on our direct digital bookings, things like that, which do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs as an example, all the productivity efforts that we've done to help improve our productivity per room. We've obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels. But as far as structural changes in the contracts, there's nothing really to look for there."

As we've discussed in the past, small- and medium-sized companies, which are about 60% of those BT room nights are fully recovered. And in fact, in Q3, their room nights were up about 10%. When you pivot to the larger companies, your comments are right. Special corporate, which tends to be a lot of those big companies, their room nights were down about 17% in the quarter. And when you start to look at the specific tiers within special corporate, you brought up tech as an example. They were down about 23% in the quarter. trying to respond more qualitatively in terms of what we're hearing from them. I think it's really embedded in the short booking window. They absolutely talk about the value of face-to-face interaction with each other, with their customers, with their clients. But they are also, again, much like our group customers willing to trade a bit of pricing for flexibility. And then the last thing I would say to try to address your question, we are relatively early in the special corporate rate negotiations.

I think number 1 for Marriott we've never had a better stack of conversion-friendly brands and across multiple quality tiers, which is really encouraging for us. Number two, we talked a bit about the constriction in the debt markets. There is meaningfully not meaningfully relatively more debt available for existing assets than there is new construction but the same lenses from the lender's perspective apply, brand affiliation, track record. And so in order to source the debt that is available for existing assets, I think you see existing owners and buyers of assets thinking longer and harder about brand affiliation. And then I think third, I mentioned this in response to 1 of the earlier questions.

So that's going to be everywhere from New York to Tulsa to smaller markets that are -- at limited service hotels rather than -- the larger special corporate accounts obviously are more headquartered in the urban large cities. The thing I will say is we've continued to see progress as we move along. When you think of, for example, you think of New York City, which has moved quite nicely during the year, with the improvement in BT, where they were down 29% in Q1 to where New York City was actually 3% higher in Q3 than 2019. So I think you will continue to see the progress, the trends in BT are similar, both internationally as well as in the U.S. I do think as we move into 2023, a lot of this world depend on the state of the economy. So kind of having a prediction about exactly where BT will go, it is tough to pinpoint. We do look for continued improvement and think it will ultimately get back to where it was, but the exact timing of that hard to say. And then the last thing I'll point out is just the reality that we have seen it moderate in terms of its rate of improvement as we've moved into Q3, and I would expect to see that moderation continue."

Compared to prepandemic levels, worldwide RevPAR in September reached a new monthly high watermark, increasing more than 4% or nearly 7%, excluding Greater China. 
During the quarter, leisure demand remained strong, well above 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, Full-Service group revenue for the quarter showed continued growth, ending up 3% over the same quarter in 2019. Fourth quarter Full-Service group revenue is currently pacing up 4%, but is likely to improve further given the strong last-minute group bookings that we've seen all year. The trend towards last-minute bookings has led to meaningful compression in pricing power, helping group ADR for new bookings rise each quarter this year.  
At our managed hotels in the U.S., ADR for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings made in the third quarter rose 17% compared to same year bookings made in the 2019, 3rd quarter. A significant jump from the 6% increase we saw in the first quarter. ADR for group bookings made in the third quarter for 2023 outpaced 2019, 3rd quarter bookings for events in 2000 by 24%. Business transient demand also continued to improve during the quarter, although it still lags 2019 levels. Third quarter business transient room nights in the U.S. and Canada were 11% below 2019. We are currently in the midst of our special corporate negotiations for 2023 and are very pleased with how they're progressing. After 2 years of holding rates steady, the early results look positive for at least high single-digit year-over-year rate growth.
Third quarter day-of-the-week trends continue to suggest that travelers are combining leisure and business trips. In fact, the average length of a transient business trip has increased meaningfully, and year-to-date is up more than 15% compared to 2019. With borders reopened in most countries around the world, rising cross-border travel helped spur demand during the quarter, especially in Europe and in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region. Cross-border guests accounted for 15% of our global room nights in the third quarter, an uptick from 12% in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, 18% of travel to our properties was from cross-border guests. So we anticipate additional upside from international travel especially from Greater China once stringent travel restrictions are relaxed.  
Given rapidly rising interest rates and growing concerns about a possible global recession, we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends. There is no doubt that the hospitality industry is impacted by economic cycles. And with transient booking windows averaging only about 3 weeks, trends could change relatively quickly. However, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. In fact, we've seen just the opposite. Booking trends remain very healthy. Given sustained high levels of employment, consumer trends prioritizing experiences versus goods, pent-up travel demand and a high level of consumer savings, travel spending has been incredibly resilient. 
In October, demand remained strong across our regions, with the exception of Greater China, where trends are still low. Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program grew to 173 million members at the end of the third quarter. The program achieved record penetration levels in the quarter reaching 60% in the U.S. and Canada and 53% globally. Members also continued to engage with our co-brand credit cards, which had another solid quarter. After recently making significant enhancements by adding new benefits to many of our U.S. cards, sign-ups have well exceeded expectations. 
This led to record new cardholder acquisitions as well as record spending for the first 9 months of this year. We also introduced 2 mid-tier cards at the end of September, which should help drive strong growth going forward. While much smaller fee contributors that are U.S. co-brand cards, we have similarly seen record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spend.
This has been particularly driven by China, where we've had great traction after launching our first cards there in July. Our Bonvoy members have been increasingly interacting with the platform through our direct digital channels, which helps boost owner and franchisee profitability. Since 2019, our share of room nights booked through direct digital channels has increased more than 5 percentage points to 38% while our distribution through OTAs has risen by less than 1 percentage point to 12%. 
The power of Bonvoy in our direct channels has also been evident in our latest offering, the Ritz-Carlton Yacht which made its inaugural voyage from Barcelona last month. Remarkably, around 2/3 of all bookings for this incredible brand extension have been through direct channels, which is many times above the rates most cruise companies experience. Additionally, Bonvoy members account for more than half of the Yacht bookings. We look forward to more ships joining the portfolio in the future.  
Shifting to the development front, our pipeline grew for the fourth quarter in a row, totaling more than 502,000 rooms by the end of the third quarter. Signing activity in the quarter remained healthy in most regions of the world. Our development team continues to be laser focused on conversions, a particularly bright spot in the development story. Conversions represented 21% of room signings and 27% of room openings in the quarter. We are very enthusiastic about the level of conversations on conversions, including for multiunit conversion opportunities. 
Outside the Greater China, we were pleased to see new construction starts pick up nicely in the third quarter. While not yet back to 2019 levels, new construction starts in the U.S. reached the highest quarterly level since the pandemic began. For full year 2022, we now expect gross rooms growth of approximately 4.5% compared to our prior expectation of closer to 5%. The change is primarily a result of fewer expected openings in Greater China as the lockdowns there have extended construction time lines. The good news is that we have not seen deals in Greater China or in any of our regions falling out of the pipeline at a higher than usual rate. With just 2 months left in the year, we now expect deletions at the bottom end of our prior guidance. Deletions could be about 1.5% for 2022 or 1%, excluding the 50 basis point impact from our exit from Russia.  
So our net rooms growth for 2022 is likely to be around 3% or 3.5% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We're always looking at opportunities that help broaden the offering for our guests as well as our owners and franchisees. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the City Express brand portfolio. which is currently comprised of 152 hotels with over 17,000 rooms in the CALA region. We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential. Upon closing this transaction, we will immediately gain a significant foothold in this high-growth segment in CALA, while also becoming the largest hotel company in the region. 
We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in CALA as well as other locations around the world. If the transaction closes before year-end, our 2022 gross rooms growth could be around 5.5%, and our net rooms growth could be approximately 4%. We really look forward to working with the City Express team. We expect solid rooms growth going forward, given the attractiveness of our portfolio of global brands, our powerful loyalty program, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline. While the exact timing will depend on how new construction starts trend from here, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth.  
Now before I turn it over to Leeny, I just want to recognize and thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment, passion and resilience. Leeny?"

We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global RevPAR growth. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5%, above pre-pandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. R",1060,"Thank you, Tony. We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global RevPAR growth. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5%, above pre-pandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPAR for all market types; primary, secondary and tertiary and all brand types from luxury through extended stay was more fully recovered for the first time. With the exception of Asia Pacific, our international regions posted incredibly strong RevPAR growth as restrictions across most countries fully lifted. Europe, in particular, benefited from a large increase in U.S. leisure demand, thanks to the strong dollar. 
Compared to 2019, third quarter RevPAR rose 6% in Europe, nearly 19% in the Middle East and Africa and nearly 18% in CALA. RevPAR is still lagging behind 2019 levels in Greater China and in our Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC region. Greater China improved the most in the quarter with RevPAR 23% below 2019, 30 percentage points better than a quarter ago. However, the recovery there remains uneven given China's renewed commitment to its strict 0 COVID policy. The good news is that we continue to see that when a market reopens for domestic travel after a lockdown, lodging demand rebounds very quickly.  
In APAC, South Korea joined India and Australia in crossing the full recovery mark, but this was offset by Japan's borders remaining closed until the end of the quarter. Third quarter RevPAR in APAC was 14% below pre-pandemic levels, an 8 percentage point improvement from a quarter ago. As we move through the fourth quarter, APAC is benefiting from a recovery in airlift in Japan's now open orders. Three quarter -- third quarter total gross fees of $1.1 billion rose 11% compared to 2019, exceeding the top end of our guidance. 
Growth was driven by RevPAR improvement and room additions as well as another quarter of strong non-RevPAR related fees. Those fees totaled $192 million in the third quarter, largely aided by ongoing growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose 22% year-over-year. The strength of our industry-leading luxury portfolio also contributed significantly to fee growth in the quarter. Gross fees from our luxury properties were up 13% versus the same quarter in 2019, even with Greater China's weaker performance. While our luxury properties account for 21% of our managed rooms, they contributed 34% of our total incentive management fees in the third quarter.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA also exceeded the high end of our guidance, outpacing the same quarter in 2019 by 9%. With the strong U.S. dollar, foreign exchange net of hedging, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $22 million in the quarter, some of which was included in our guidance a quarter ago. This negative currency translation was more than made up for by the positive impact from increased U.S. leisure travel abroad. We estimate net of our hedges, a 100 basis point change in the U.S. dollar could affect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA by less than $10 million. 
G&A and other expenses totaled $216 million in the third quarter, better than our guidance, largely reflecting lower-than-expected administrative costs and bad debt. At the hotel level, we remain focused on containing operating costs for our owners and franchisees while also delivering superior service to our guests. With ADR of 15% above 2019 and our significant productivity enhancements, third quarter profit margins at our U.S. and Canada managed hotels were 2 full percentage points above 2019 levels despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Wage and benefit growth while still high, continued to moderate in the third quarter.  
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance, the details of which are in our press release. As we headed into the end of the year, we're very pleased with the strong continued momentum in our business. Group's transient bookings are showing further gains against 2019. In both the U.S. and Canada and internationally, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR compared to pre-pandemic levels to accelerate from the third quarter, even with anticipated weaker demand in Greater China. Compared to 2019, fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 4% to 6% in the U.S. and Canada, be down 2% to flat internationally and increase 2% to 4% globally. 
Worldwide fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 27% to 29% over fourth quarter 2021. We're still working through our 2023 budgets and recognize that there is heightened macro uncertainty. That said, we currently think 2023 global RevPAR could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison given the impact of the Omicron variant in early 2022.
For full year 2022, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $880 million to $890 million, slightly better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower bad debt expense. We're also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA of around $3.79 billion at the midpoint of the range, which is 6% higher than our prior full peak year in 2019. Due to the timing of some capital expenditures for owned, leased hotels and corporate systems as well as key money payments, we now expect full year investment spending of closer to $500 million, assuming the City Express transaction does not close in 2022. Strong spending on our credit cards is expected to result in loyalty being a slight source of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies.
Year-to-date, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, a significant increase of nearly $1.2 billion compared to the first 3 quarters of last year, a strong reminder of the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was excellent at the low end of investment grade targets. With our solid financial results and cash flow generations, we have already returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through October 31, and we now expect to return more than $2.7 billion to shareholders this year.
In closing, we're incredibly proud of how well our business is performing and how resilient our business has proven to be. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?"

We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we're seeing in the debt markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S. is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shovels in the ground but we're quite encouraged about the consistency we've seen in the volume of under-construction projects in our pipeline. In fact, we were looking at it over the last few days. As you saw in our release, we continue to have a little over 200,000 rooms under construction. 
It's actually the 20th straight quarter where we had more than 200,000 rooms under construction globally. The market in China is most certainly -- where we're seeing the most challenges. The disproportionate share of our projects in the pipeline in China, in fact, about 60% are in the luxury and upper -- upscale tier, principally in primary markets, which are -- well, the combination of those quality tiers in those markets caused those projects to be the most significant fee generators, but they are more complex development projects, and it takes a little longer for them to get open in a market like China. But broadly, we continue to see really powerful interest in our portfolio of brands. And we're maybe most encouraged by the volume both on signings and openings in the conversion tier."

But I think we've got some things in our business that really do lead us to confidence about 2023, although we are not predicting per se a recession. We clearly believe there does continue to be pent-up travel demand, particularly in parts of the world where the borders are just opening. We're also seeing just generally a desire for travel and services as compared to goods, which we do see strongly in leisure. Also see, as we think about kind of the overall macro environment that there is pent-up savings for the consumer. 
So we'll have to see. But again, from where we sit right now and as we look into the booking trends moving into 2023, we continue to see strength across all the business segments, Shaun. And then the last thing I would say is the reality is our booking window is still short. So at roughly 3 weeks for transient bookings, things could change relatively quickly.

And so I don't know that looking at that down 11% is particularly relevant. Even for Q4 this year, we're up 4%, and we think that will likely improve through the quarter, given the strength of short-term bookings and the trade that many of our customers are making for flexibility and they're willing to pay a higher rate. 
When I look deeper into what's on the books for 2023, room nights are down in the high teens. ADR is actually up close to about 10%. And then I think your second question was really about when that business is being booked? I guess I'll try to give you some 2022 data that is hopefully indicative of the trends we're seeing. About 50% of the group business we've seen year-to-date in 2022 was booked in the year, for the year.

So I think you'll continue to see growth in the cardholders and then growth in spend. But whether it matches exactly RevPAR, we're not in a position to say specifically. 
Obviously, when you look at compared to '19, those credit card fees have grown meaningfully more than hotel-related fees because of COVID and the steady growth in cardholders and credit card spend each and every year as we've moved through 2019. But I -- again, broadly speaking, we are looking at growth of non-RevPAR fees in 2023, both from credit cardholders as well as spend.

As has always been the case in constricted debt markets, brand affiliation, track record of the developer, strength of the sponsorship are what -- are the factors that capture the construction debt that is, in fact, available. And so we see signs that the strength of our brands continue to capture a disproportionate share of what's out there. 
A quarter or so ago, we announced closing on the financing for a $1.2 billion Gaylord Pacific Hotel in Chula Vista, California.

First of all, just from the dollar size, David, we were at $35 million of IMFs or about 1/3 from the U.S. and Canada, and that is pretty similar to what it was in Q3 '19. It was 39%. Now it was 26% of overall hotels in the U.S. and Canada earning incentive fees in Q3 and 56% in '19. But it's important to break out full service from limited service because the reality is that we had a large portfolio back in '19 of managed limited service hotels, which, as you know, left our system over a year ago. 
So if you actually look at full service, we're actually at a slightly higher percentage of hotels earning IMFs in full service than we were in '19. And again, as we talked about before, in my comments that you saw house profit margins at our full-service hotels, up 200 basis points compared to '19 with our strong RevPAR performance and really strong efforts on the cost containment side. So I -- we feel good about what's going on. We've talked about -- hoped for expected growth in RevPAR in 2023, both U.S. and internationally, which should bode well for continued progress on incentive fees. 
Obviously, wage and benefit growth is something we're keeping an eye on, which has moderated a bit, although it still reflects the fact that we're in an inflationary environment. And then the last thing I'll say is we've continued to see improvement in the large urban markets where we've got a number of managed Full-Service hotels in the U.S. And we've seen nice progress as we moved into Q3 in some of those urban markets, and we expect them to continue on as we move into 2023 with that recovery."

So I would say, while we did things that on a temporary basis like helped on the reducing reimbursable costs and helping with extensions on accounts receivable, they were all really overwhelmingly temporary things. And then also, if you remember, 85% of the things that we charge are based on top line revenues of the hotel. So they flex as the revenues go up and down, which is helpful to the hotel owners. 
I think you see things like what we've talked about on our direct digital bookings, things like that, which do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs as an example, all the productivity efforts that we've done to help improve our productivity per room. We've obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels.

When you pivot to the larger companies, your comments are right. Special corporate, which tends to be a lot of those big companies, their room nights were down about 17% in the quarter. And when you start to look at the specific tiers within special corporate, you brought up tech as an example. They were down about 23% in the quarter. Trying to respond more qualitatively in terms of what we're hearing from them. I think it's really embedded in the short booking window. They absolutely talk about the value of face-to-face interaction with each other, with their customers, with their clients. 
But they are also, again, much like our group customers willing to trade a bit of pricing for flexibility.

So that's going to be everywhere from New York to Tulsa to smaller markets that are -- at limited-service hotels rather than -- the larger special corporate accounts obviously are more headquartered in the urban large cities. 
The thing I will say is we've continued to see progress as we move too along. When you think of, for example, you think of New York City, which has moved quite nicely during the year, with the improvement in BT, where they were down 29% in Q1. Today New York City was actually 3% higher in Q3 than 2019. So I think you will continue to see the progress, the trends in BT are similar, both internationally as well as in the U.S. I do think as we move into 2023, a lot of this world depend on the state of the economy. So kind of having a prediction about exactly where BT will go, it is tough to pinpoint. 
We do look for continued improvement and think it will ultimately get back to where it was, but the exact timing of that hard to say. And then the last thing I'll point out is just the reality that we have seen it moderate in terms of its rate of improvement as we've moved into Q3, and I would expect to see that moderation continue."
