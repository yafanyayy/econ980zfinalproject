I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've lear",910,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. 
I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time, being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bear market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals. I've seen deflationary threats. I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30x earnings, and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7x earnings. 
With all this experience, that comes with age, I might add, here's what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on high-yield securities are approaching historically tight levels while key credit metrics, such as leverage and coverage ratios, are showing signs of weakening.  The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time. 
With respect to rates, the 10-year treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknowns of our current economic and political landscape both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect and it concerns me.
The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19x earnings, 3 turns [ph] higher than the 50-year average of 16. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more. 
The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers. The wave of private capital, combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rate has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for a company that haven't already been gobbled up by strategic buyers. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time. Complacency reigns supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. 
So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we bought back relatively few low shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.
In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock than the first half of the year when Loews shares were trading at lower prices and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. 
As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity market. 
Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share repurchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buy back our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes, we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are a flip at the switch. But I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders. 
As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked if my foot is getting sore, and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. 
We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction, from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics, add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we had hoped they would. 
It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our long-standing philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes, we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes, we choose to take the action of taking no action. 
Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all. Now over to our CFO, David Edelson."

CNA was a major contributor",1060,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total. 
Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available by webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website. 
Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by 2 unusual items totaling $359 million, the a $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond.  Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. 4 main items drove this quarterly increase, the first 3 of which related to CNA. 
First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding the reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operatings results. By resetting these reserve based on management's best estimates, long-term care should, on average, generate breakeven results if actual experience is in line with those estimates. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss. 
Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver, as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimates adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.
Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and other than temporary impairments taken to maintain flexibility. 
And fourth, Loews' parent company net investment income was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset in part by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments, declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond caused by fewer rigs operating and thus, fewer revenue-earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.
Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels, income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effective tax rate declined. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same 2 unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.
The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by $177 million and rig impairment charges at Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million. And by $267 million in 2016. 
Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income with Diamond Offshore being the main counterbalance. CNA benefited from higher earnings its Life & Group segment given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives.
Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities also contributing nicely. On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income, absent the impairment charges, declined from 2015 to 2016. 
The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue-earning days and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. 
As you know, we maintained a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 principal reasons: To enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

What we've seen from some of his statements and some of the executive orders is a push towards reducing cumbersome rules and regulation. And I think that is positive. But what we're really going to have to wait to see is what happens with the major economic legislation that comes before Congress. There's only so much that a President can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to health care and a whole bunch of other legislations. So I would say that I am hopeful that I think also it's too early to tell. One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary, and that is that, as you know, for the past 6, 7 years, we've grown at about 2% a year. And we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you'll get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP. So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial progrowth policies will be in the United States. I believe in that for the past 6 or 7 years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyching was due to the fact that we had anemic growth. And I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now we'll see if the man in office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that."

So far, the number of universal Loews rooms, which are on the universal campus, is measured at 5,000 or 6,000. So as I said, there's room for growth in Orlando. Where in the rest of the country, where we don't have such a large demand driver, then the growth has been and probably will continue to be slower there.

That's all a base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see, with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in 5 or 6 years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80 plus billion cubic feet per day.

And Boardwalk is working very hard in making it strategic plan so that it can capture as much of that natural gas as possible."

I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've lear",909,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. 
I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time, being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bear market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals. I've seen deflationary threats. I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30x earnings, and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7x earnings. 
With all this experience, that comes with age, I might add, here's what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on high-yield securities are approaching historically tight levels while key credit metrics, such as leverage and coverage ratios, are showing signs of weakening. The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time. 
With respect to rates, the 10-year treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknowns of our current economic and political landscape both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect and it concerns me.
The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19x earnings, 3 turns higher than the 50-year average of 16. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more. 
The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers. The wave of private capital, combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rate has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for a company that haven't already been gobbled up by strategic buyers. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time. Complacency reigns supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. 
So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we bought back relatively few low shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.
In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock than the first half of the year when Loews shares were trading at lower prices and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. 
As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity market. 
Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share repurchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buy back our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes, we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are a flip at the switch. But I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders. 
As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked if my foot is getting sore, and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. 
We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction, from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics, add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we had hoped they would. 
It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our long-standing philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes, we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes, we choose to take the action of taking no action. 
Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all. Now over to our CFO, David Edelson."

CNA was a major contributor",1060,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total. 
Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available by webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website. 
Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by 2 unusual items totaling $359 million, the a $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond. Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. 4 main items drove this quarterly increase, the first 3 of which related to CNA. 
First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding the reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operating results. By resetting these reserve based on management's best estimates, long-term care should, on average, generate breakeven results if actual experience is in line with those estimates. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss. 
Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver, as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimates adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.
Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and other than temporary impairments taken to maintain flexibility. 
And fourth, Loews' parent company net investment income was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset in part by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments, declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond caused by fewer rigs operating and thus, fewer revenue-earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.
Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels, income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effective tax rate declined. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same 2 unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.
The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by $177 million and rig impairment charges at Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million. And by $267 million in 2016. 
Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income with Diamond Offshore being the main counterbalance. CNA benefited from higher earnings its Life & Group segment given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives.
Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities also contributing nicely. On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income, absent the impairment charges, declined from 2015 to 2016. 
The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue-earning days and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. 
As you know, we maintained a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 principal reasons: To enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

There's only so much that a president can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to health care and a whole bunch of other legislation. So I would say that I am hopeful, but I think also it's too early to tell. One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary, and that is that, as you know, for the past 6, 7 years, we've grown at about 2% a year. And we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you'll get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP. So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial pro-growth policies will be in the United States. I believe that for the past 6 or 7 years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyche was due to the fact that we had anemic growth. And I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now we'll see if the man in office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that."

So far, the number of Universal Loews rooms, which are on the Universal campus, is measured at 5,000 or 6,000. So as I said, there's room for growth in Orlando.

Exports to Mexico have increased about 1 billion cubic feet a year for the past several years, and it looks like that's set to continue increasing. That's all a base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see, with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in 5 or 6 years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80-plus billion cubic feet per day. And the thing I know about that 80 billion cubic feet of natural gas, it's all going to have to move in a natural gas pipeline. And Boardwalk is working very hard in making its strategic plan so that it can capture as much of that natural gas as possible."

I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've lear",908,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. 
I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time, being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bear market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals. I've seen deflationary threats. I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30x earnings, and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7x earnings. 
With all this experience, that comes with age I might add, here's what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on high-yield securities are approaching historically tight levels while key credit metrics, such as leverage and coverage ratios, are showing signs of weakening. The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time. 
With respect to rates, the 10-year Treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknowns of our current economic and political landscape both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect and it concerns me.
The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19x earnings, 3 turns higher than the 50-year average of 16x. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more. 
The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers. The wave of private capital, combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rate has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for a company that hasn’t already been gobbled up by strategic buyers. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time. Complacency reigns supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. 
So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we bought back relatively few Loews shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.
In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock than the first half of the year when Loews shares were trading at lower prices and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. 
As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity market. 
Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share repurchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buy back our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes, we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are asleep at the switch. But I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time, measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders. 
As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked if my foot is getting sore, and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. 
We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction, from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics, add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we had hoped they would. 
It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our long-standing philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes, we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes, we choose to take the action of taking no action. 
Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all. Now over to our CFO, David Edelson."

For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor",1061,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total. 
Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available via webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website. 
Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by 2 unusual items totaling $359 million, the $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond. Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. 4 main items drove this quarterly increase, the first 3 of which related to CNA. 
First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding a reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operating results. By resetting these reserve based on management's best estimates, long-term care should, on average, generate breakeven results if actual experience is in line with those estimates. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss. 
Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver, as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimates adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.
Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and, other than temporary impairments, taken to maintain flexibility. 
And fourth, Loews' parent company net investment income was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset in part by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments, declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond caused by fewer rigs operating and thus, fewer revenue-earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.
Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels, income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effective tax rate declined. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same 2 unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.
The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by $177 million and rig impairment charges at Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million. And by $267 million in 2016. 
Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income with Diamond Offshore being the main tender balance. CNA benefited from higher earnings in its Life & Group segment given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives.
Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities also contributing nicely. On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income, absent the impairment charges, declined from 2015 to 2016. 
The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue-earning days and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. 
As you know, we maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 principal reasons: To enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

Marc Edwards and the team at Diamond Offshore are in a tough market that has only gotten tougher. Marc has been doing a phenomenal job in leading Diamond through this turbulent period and certainly deserves combat pay. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the most respected CEOs in the natural gas transportation space. Under his leadership, Boardwalk has continued to strengthen its balance sheet while strategically building out the company's transportation system and advantageously utilizing its existing assets. And last, but certainly not least, Jon Tisch at Loews Hotels is a star in the hotel industry and is leading one of the industry's premier brands into its next phase of growth.

What we've seen from some of his statements and some of the executive orders is a push towards reducing cumbersome rules and regulation. And I think that is positive. But what we're really going to have to wait to see is what happens with major economic legislation that comes before Congress. There's only so much that a president can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to health care and a whole bunch of other legislation. So I would say that I am hopeful, but I think also it's too early to tell. 
One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary, and that is that, as you know, for the past 6, 7 years, we've grown at about 2% a year. And we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you'll get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP. So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial pro-growth policies will be in the United States. I believe that for the past 6 or 7 years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyche was due to the fact that we had anemic growth. And I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now we'll see if the man in office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that."

Exports to Mexico have increased about 1 billion cubic feet a year for the past several years, and it looks like that's set to continue increasing. That's all on base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see -- with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in 5 or 6 years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80-plus billion cubic feet per day.

I have an expression that goes, ""Sounds good when you say it fast."" And when you say it fast, yes, all Loews does is collect dividends from its subsidiaries and watch over them a bit. But in fact, there's an awful lot more that's going on. There is compliance. There is investments. There's monitoring. There's the proverbial kicking those tires of looking for new businesses.

I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016.

I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. 
I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time, being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bear market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals. I've seen deflationary threats. I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30x earnings, and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7x earnings. 
With all this experience, that comes with age I might add, here's what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on high-yield securities are approaching historically tight levels while key credit metrics, such as leverage and coverage ratios, are showing signs of weakening. The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time. 
With respect to rates, the 10-year Treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknowns of our current economic and political landscape both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect and it concerns me.
The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19x earnings, 3 turns higher than the 50-year average of 16x. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more. 
The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers. The wave of private capital, combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rate has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for a company that hasn’t already been gobbled up by strategic buyers. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time. Complacency reigns supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. 
So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we bought back relatively few Loews shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.
In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock than the first half of the year when Loews shares were trading at lower prices and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. 
As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity market. 
Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share repurchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buy back our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes, we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are asleep at the switch. But I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time, measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders. 
As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked if my foot is getting sore, and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. 
We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction, from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics, add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we had hoped they would. 
It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our long-standing philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes, we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes, we choose to take the action of taking no action. 
Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all. Now over to our CFO, David Edelson."

For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total. 
Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available via webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website. 
Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by 2 unusual items totaling $359 million, the $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond. Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. 4 main items drove this quarterly increase, the first 3 of which related to CNA. 
First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding a reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operating results. By resetting these reserve based on management's best estimates, long-term care should, on average, generate breakeven results if actual experience is in line with those estimates. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss. 
Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver, as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimates adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.
Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and, other than temporary impairments, taken to maintain flexibility. 
And fourth, Loews' parent company net investment income was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset in part by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments, declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond caused by fewer rigs operating and thus, fewer revenue-earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.
Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels, income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effective tax rate declined. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same 2 unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.
The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by $177 million and rig impairment charges at Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million. And by $267 million in 2016. 
Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income with Diamond Offshore being the main tender balance. CNA benefited from higher earnings in its Life & Group segment given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives.
Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities also contributing nicely. On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income, absent the impairment charges, declined from 2015 to 2016. 
The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue-earning days and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. 
As you know, we maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 principal reasons: To enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

What we've seen from some of his statements and some of the executive orders is a push towards reducing cumbersome rules and regulation. And I think that is positive. But what we're really going to have to wait to see is what happens with major economic legislation that comes before Congress. There's only so much that a president can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to health care and a whole bunch of other legislation. So I would say that I am hopeful, but I think also it's too early to tell. One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary, and that is that, as you know, for the past 6, 7 years, we've grown at about 2% a year. And we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you'll get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP. So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial pro-growth policies will be in the United States. I believe that for the past 6 or 7 years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyche was due to the fact that we had anemic growth. And I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now we'll see if the man in office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that."

So far, the number of Universal Loews rooms, which are on the Universal campus, is measured at 5,000 or 6,000. So as I said, there's room for growth in Orlando. Where -- in the rest of the country, where we don't have such a large demand driver, then the growth has been and probably will continue to be slower.

When I think of natural gas and natural gas demand, the real demand driver in my mind is exports of natural gas, which in the course of the next 3 or 4 or 5 years will go from 0 LNG to 10 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas for LNG.

Exports to Mexico have increased about 1 billion cubic feet a year for the past several years, and it looks like that's set to continue increasing. That's all on base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see -- with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in 5 or 6 years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80-plus billion cubic feet per day. And the thing I know about that 80 billion cubic feet of natural gas, it's all going to have to move in a natural gas pipeline. And Boardwalk is working very hard in making its strategic plan so that it can capture as much of that natural gas as possible."

I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've lear",908,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. I want to start by sharing my thoughts on the financial market as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. 
I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time, being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bear market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals. I've seen deflationary threats. I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30x earnings, and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7x earnings. 
With all this experience, that comes with age I might add, here's what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on high-yield securities are approaching historically tight levels while key credit metrics, such as leverage and coverage ratios, are showing signs of weakening. The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time. 
With respect to rates, the 10-year Treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknowns of our current economic and political landscape both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect and it concerns me.
The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19x earnings, 3 turns higher than the 50-year average of '16. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more. 
The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers. The wave of private capital, combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rate has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for a company that hasn’t already been gobbled up by strategic buyers. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time. Complacency reigns supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. 
So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we bought back relatively few Loews shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.
In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock than the first half of the year when Loews shares were trading at lower prices and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. 
As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity market. 
Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share repurchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buy back our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes, we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are asleep at the switch. But I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time, measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders. 
As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked if my foot is getting sore, and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. 
We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction, from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics, add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we had hoped they would. 
It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our long-standing philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes, we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes, we choose to take the action of taking no action. 
Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all. Now over to our CFO, David Edelson."

CNA was a major contributor",1061,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was a major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total. 
Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available via webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website. 
Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by 2 unusual items totaling $359 million, the $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond. Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. 4 main items drove this quarterly increase, the first 3 of which related to CNA. 
First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding a reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operating results. By resetting these reserve based on management's best estimates, long-term care should, on average, generate breakeven results if actual experience is in line with those estimates. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss. 
Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver, as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimates adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.
Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and, other than temporary impairments, taken to maintain flexibility. 
And fourth, Loews' parent company net investment income was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset in part by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments, declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond caused by fewer rigs operating and thus, fewer revenue-earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.
Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels, income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effective tax rate declined. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same 2 unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.
The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by $177 million and rig impairment charges at Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million. And by $267 million in 2016. 
Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income with Diamond Offshore being the main tender balance. CNA benefited from higher earnings in its Life & Group segment given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives.
Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities also contributing nicely. On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income, absent the impairment charges, declined from 2015 to 2016. 
The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue-earning days and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. 
As you know, we maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 principal reasons: To enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

Before we open up the call to questions, I want to take a moment to talk about the leadership that we have in place in each of our subsidiaries. Dino Robusto joined CNA in November of 2016 as its CEO. What we've already seen in this short period of time is his strategic thinking, his operational expertise and his tremendous drive, he has really energized the employees, brokers and agents of CNA. Marc Edwards and the team at Diamond Offshore are in a tough market that has only gotten tougher. Marc has been doing a phenomenal job in leading Diamond through this turbulent period and certainly deserves combat pay. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the most respected CEOs in the natural gas transportation space. Under his leadership, Boardwalk has continued to strengthen its balance sheet while strategically building out the company's transportation system and advantageously utilizing its existing assets. And last, but certainly not least, Jon Tisch at Loews Hotels is a star in the hotel industry and is leading one of the industry's premier brands into its next phase of growth. I want to thank each of our CEOs for the many contributions they are making to Loews and to its shareholders. Now back to Mary."

What we've seen from some of his statements and some of the executive orders is a push towards reducing cumbersome rules and regulation. And I think that is positive. But what we're really going to have to wait to see is what happens with major economic legislation that comes before Congress. There's only so much that a president can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to health care and a whole bunch of other legislation. So I would say that I am hopeful, but I think also it's too early to tell. One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary, and that is that, as you know, for the past 6, 7 years, we've grown at about 2% a year. And we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you'll get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP. So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial pro-growth policies will be in the United States. I believe that for the past 6 or 7 years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyche was due to the fact that we had anemic growth. And I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now we'll see if the man in office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that."

So in Orlando, there's very significant growth. And that's driven because the demand driver is right there. It's the theme park. And -- whereas Disney has tens of thousands of hotel rooms. So far, the number of Universal Loews rooms, which are on the Universal campus, is measured at 5,000 or 6,000. So as I said, there's room for growth in Orlando. Where -- in the rest of the country, where we don't have such a large demand driver, then the growth has been and probably will continue to be slower.

Exports to Mexico have increased about 1 billion cubic feet a year for the past several years, and it looks like that's set to continue increasing. That's all on base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see -- with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in 5 or 6 years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80-plus billion cubic feet per day.

I have an expression that goes, ""Sounds good when you say it fast."" And when you say it fast, yes, all Loews does is collect dividends from its subsidiaries and watch over them a bit.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our final call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire",602,"Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining our final call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Container Company or CCC for $1.2 billion. The company is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia that makes containers for stable end markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. The acquisition of CCC will add a new industry to Loews' already diverse portfolio of businesses and provide a great foundation for expansion through organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. 
We've been analyzing the packaging industry for quite some time, getting to know it well and looking for the right deal, and we believe we found it. CCC is an outstanding company that checks all the boxes for Loews' criteria. 
First of all, the size of the investment meets the Goldilocks test. The $600 million check is just right, allowing us to feel comfortable about making add-on investments down of the road. Aside from the size of the investment, the other check boxes are the fragmentation of the industry, the opportunity for add-on investments, their defensive position in consumer end markets, strong cash-on-cash returns and a highly qualified management team. 
Consolidated sector is the -- of the packaging industry is attractive to us for a number of reasons. The rigid plastic packaging sector is somewhat recession resistant in that its products are used primarily for nondiscretionary consumer items. And while there are evolutionary changes in the business, we believe it's unlikely that this sector will be subject to major technological disruption.
CCC is the largest national player in the small to medium volume segment of this industry with 59 manufacturing facilities across the U.S., either co-located or close to their customers, a distinct advantage in minimizing transportation costs. The company have long-term client relationships with little turnover in its customer base. 
Over the last several years, CCC has focused on customers who have small but growing brands that had been challenging traditional incumbents in various product classes, such as seventh generation cleaning products and for so laundry detergent. A data point that will come as no surprise to our shareholders is that we especially like the steady cash flow characteristics of this sector. 
We anticipate near double-digit cash-on-cash returns on our investment. CCC's free cash flow will, for the foreseeable future, be used either to pay down debt or to finance acquisitions. 
Finally, and most importantly, CCC has a strong and experienced management team with a track record of operational excellence. As I've said before, we kicked a lot of tires in this process, and we have yet to come across a management team as ready for primetime as CCC's. We look forward to working with its CEO, Sean foemen, and his team to profitably grow the company. 
The acquisition of CCC will be financed with approximately 50% cash and 50% debt at the CCC level. For Loews, this is a relatively small acquisition that allows us to continue to retain substantial liquidity at the parent company. After the close, Loews will still have approximately $5 billion of cash and investments. 
We expect the transaction to close later this month and will include partial quarter financial results for the Loews Packaging Group in our second quarter earnings release. As far as this quarter goes, I'm happy with our results and the progress of each of our subsidiary. Our CFO, David Edelson, will now provide more details. Over to you, David"
285930,428076538,1184067,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year",909,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year quarterly earnings improvement. These are also set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement. The supplement is available by webcast and has been posted to the Loews IR website. 
In summary, CNA had an excellent quarter and contributed the bulk of our net income, accounting for approximately 80% of the total. Similarly, CNA drove our year-over-year increase with Boardwalk Pipeline, Loews Hotels and parent company investments also contributing. Diamond Offshore was the main earnings drag this quarter, given the ongoing difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market. 
Turning to the details. CNA's substantial increase in net income came on the back of strong net investment income, a lower recto-active reinsurance charge then in the prior year, a significant turnaround in realized gains and good underwriting results in its core P&C business with a especially favorable results in specialty and international. 
As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, CNA's results were depressed by 3 items: Realized investment losses, which reduced our net income by $17 million; losses on LP investments, which reduced our net income by $7 million; and a retroactive reinsurance charge, which reduced our net income by $74 million. The charge was related to the transfer of the company's asbestos and environmental solution liabilities to National Indemnity in 2010. 
Taken together, these 3 items lowered CNA's contribution to our first quarter 2016 net income by $98 million. Conversely, in this year's first quarter, CNA posted realized investment gains, not losses, which benefited our net income by $20 million. CNA's LP investments returned 3.8% benefiting our net income by $54 million. And while CNA booked a noncash retroactive reinsurance charge again this year, it was far smaller than last year's, reducing our net income by only $12 million versus last year's $74 million. So on a year-over-year basis, these 3 items accounted for $160 million of the $174 million increase in CNA's contribution to our net income in Q1 2017.
Away from these items, CNA showed improved results from current acts in the European sea underwriting and from the Life & Group segment, offset in part by a lower level of favorable prior year development. 
Beyond CNA, our year-over-year earnings improvement was driven by Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and parent company investments, offset by earnings decline at Diamond. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased year-over-year by 19% or $6 million, as revenues were up from recently completed growth projects as well as favorable market conditions for the company storage and parking and lending services. Boardwalk's excellent performance was highlighted by its net revenues being up 7% and EBITDA up 11%. 
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter with net income of $10 million. During the quarter, the company booked a gain on the sale of the JV property and wrote down its equity investment in another none Orlando JV property. These 2 one-time items netted to add $6 million to Q1 2017 net income. Setting aside these items, net income at Loews Hotels increased $1 million year-over-year. 
The main downdraft in the quarter was from Diamond Offshore as the depressed conditions in the offshore drilling space continue. Diamond's contribution to our Q1 net income declined from $43 million last year to $12 million in this year's first quarter. This $31 million negative swing was largely attributable to 2 factors: Diamond received a one-time demobilization feed last year that increased Diamond's contribution to our Q1 2016 net income by $13 million; and Diamond contract drilling revenue declined 10% excluding this demobilization fee, primarily due to fewer revenue-earning days. It is simply not possible for Diamond management to reduce expenses enough to compensate for the significant revenue decline it has experienced. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was strong in Q1 2017 as alternative investments and equities, including gold-related equities, drove $59 million of pretax investment income. In comparison, the parent company portfolio generated a loss in last year's first quarter as favorable results from gold-related equities were more than offset by unfavorable results from alternatives and other equities. Let me explain briefly the bump-up in our corporate expenses in the first quarter. 2 items, expenses related to acquisition activity and the timing of bonus accruals, accounted for the lion share of the increase. We expect to have additional acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter. 
As for bonuses, we will be accruing them ratably throughout the year this year, so this is simply a timing difference. Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At March 31, the parent company portfolio totaled $5.6 billion with 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investment. The parent company portfolio will decrease by just over $600 million upon the closing of the consolidated container transaction in May.
During the first quarter, we received $559 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $546 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Dividends received from CNA included a $2 per share special dividend, which itself totaled $485 million. We had no share repurchase activity during the first quarter. I will now hand the call back to Jim"

And this is not -- the purchase of CCC was not an either/or decision, vis-a-vis, Diamond Offshore. When the CCC acquisition closes, we'll still have close to $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. Rather, we saw this as -- we saw CCC as an attractive investment for Loews Corporation. It's the exact opposite in many ways of Diamond. It's totally noncyclical compared to the extreme cyclicality of Diamond Offshore. It seems to us to be a platform for growth. 
And with respect to Diamond, even at today's very low market price for Diamond, Loews still has $1 billion of exposure to the offshore drilling industry. So from a portfolio perspective, we are very comfortable with our exposure to and the upside potential for Diamond Offshore, and we're also happy to have a new subsidiary that has all the possibilities that I spoke about in my remarks just a few minutes ago."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry.

I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. 
As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Container Company, or CCC, for $1.2 billion. The company is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia that makes containers for stable end markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. The acquisition of CCC will add a new industry to Loews' already diverse portfolio of businesses and provide a great foundation for expansion through organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. 
We've been analyzing the packaging industry for quite some time, getting to know it well and looking for the right deal, and we believe we found it. CCC is an outstanding company that checks all the boxes for Loews' criteria. 
First of all, the size of the investment meets the Goldilocks test. The $600 million check is just right, allowing us to feel comfortable about making add-on investments down the road. 
Aside from the size of the investment, the other check boxes are the fragmentation of the industry, the opportunity for add-on investments, their defensive position in consumer end markets, strong cash-on-cash returns and a highly qualified management team. 
Consolidated sector is the -- of the packaging industry is attractive to us for a number of reasons. The rigid plastic packaging sector is somewhat recession resistant in that its products are used primarily for nondiscretionary consumer items. And while there are evolutionary changes in the business, we believe it's unlikely that this sector will be subject to major technological disruption.
CCC is the largest national player in the small- to medium-volume segment of this industry, with 59 manufacturing facilities across the U.S. either co-located or close to their customers, a distinct advantage in minimizing transportation costs. The company has long-term client relationships with little turnover in its customer base. 
Over the last several years, CCC has focused on customers who have small but growing brands that have been challenging traditional incumbents in various product classes such as Seventh Generation cleaning products and Persil laundry detergents. 
A data point that will come as no surprise to our shareholders is that we especially like the steady cash flow characteristics of this sector. We anticipate near double-digit cash-on-cash returns on our investment. CCC's free cash flow will, for the foreseeable future, be used either to pay down debt or to finance acquisitions. 
Finally, and most importantly, CCC has a strong and experienced management team with a track record of operational excellence. As I've said before, we kicked a lot of tires in this process, and we have yet to come across a management team as ready for prime time as CCC's. We look forward to working with its CEO, Sean Fallmann, and his team to profitably grow the company. 
The acquisition of CCC will be financed with approximately 50% cash and 50% debt at the CCC level. For Loews, this is a relatively small acquisition that allows us to continue to retain substantial liquidity at the parent company. After the close, Loews will still have approximately $5 billion of cash and investments. 
We expect the transaction to close later this month and will include partial quarter financial results for the Loews Packaging Group in our second quarter earnings release. 
As far as this quarter goes, I'm happy with our results and the progress of each of our subsidiaries. Our CFO, David Edelson, will now provide more details. Over to you, David."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter.

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year quarterly earnings improvement. These are also set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement. The supplement is available by webcast and has been posted to the Loews IR website. 
In summary, CNA had an excellent quarter and contributed the bulk of our net income, accounting for approximately 80% of the total. Similarly, CNA drove our year-over-year increase, with Boardwalk Pipeline, Loews Hotels and parent company investments also contributing. Diamond Offshore was the main earnings drag this quarter given the ongoing difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market. 
Turning to the details. CNA's substantial increase in net income came on the back of strong net investment income, a lower retroactive reinsurance charge than in the prior year, a significant turnaround in realized gains and good underwriting results in its core P&C business, with especially favorable results in specialty and international. 
As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, CNA's results were depressed by 3 items: realized investment losses, which reduced our net income by $17 million; losses on LP investments, which reduced our net income by $7 million; and a retroactive reinsurance charge, which reduced our net income by $74 million. The charge was related to the transfer of the company's asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity in 2010. 
Taken together, these 3 items lowered CNA's contribution to our first quarter 2016 net income by $98 million. 
Conversely, in this year's first quarter, CNA posted realized investment gains, not losses, which benefited our net income by $20 million. CNA's LP investments returned 3.8%, benefiting our net income by $54 million. And while CNA booked a noncash retroactive reinsurance charge again this year, it was far smaller than last year's, reducing our net income by only $12 million versus last year's $74 million. So on a year-over-year basis, these 3 items accounted for $160 million of the $174 million increase in CNA's contribution to our net income in Q1 2017.
Away from these items, CNA showed improved results from current accident year P&C underwriting and from the Life & Group segment, offset in part by a lower level of favorable prior year development. 
Beyond CNA, our year-over-year earnings improvement was driven by Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and parent company investments, offset by earnings declines at Diamond. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased year-over-year by 19% or $6 million as revenues were up from recently completed growth projects, as well as favorable market conditions for the company's storage and parking & lending services. Boardwalk's excellent performance was highlighted by its net revenues being up 7% and EBITDA up 11%. 
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During the quarter, the company booked a gain on the sale of the JV property and wrote down its equity investment in another non-Orlando JV property. These 2 onetime items netted to add $6 million to Q1 2017 net income. Setting aside these items, net income at Loews Hotels increased $1 million year-over-year. 
The main downdraft in the quarter was from Diamond Offshore as the depressed conditions in the offshore drilling space continued. Diamond's contribution to our Q1 net income declined from $43 million last year to $12 million in this year's first quarter. This $31 million negative swing was largely attributable to 2 factors: Diamond received a onetime demobilization fee last year that increased Diamond's contribution to our Q1 2016 net income by $13 million; and Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 10%, excluding this demobilization fee, primarily due to fewer revenue-earning days. It is simply not possible for Diamond management to reduce expenses enough to compensate for the significant revenue declines it has experienced. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was strong in Q1 2017 as alternative investments and equities, including gold-related equities, drove $59 million of pretax investment income. In comparison, the parent company portfolio generated a loss in last year's first quarter as favorable results from gold-related equities were more than offset by unfavorable results from alternatives and other equities. 
Let me explain briefly the bump-up in our corporate expenses in the first quarter. Two items, expenses related to acquisition activity and the timing of bonus accruals, accounted for the lion's share of the increase. We expect to have additional acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter. 
As for bonuses, we will be accruing them ratably throughout the year this year, so this is simply a timing difference. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At March 31, the parent company portfolio totaled $5.6 billion, with 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company portfolio will decrease by just over $600 million upon the closing of the Consolidated Container transaction in May.
During the first quarter, we received $559 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $546 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Dividends received from CNA included a $2 per-share special dividend, which itself totaled $485 million. 
We had no share repurchase activity during the first quarter. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

Rather, we saw this as -- we saw CCC as an attractive investment for Loews Corporation. It's the exact opposite in many ways of Diamond. It's totally noncyclical compared to the extreme cyclicality of Diamond Offshore. It seems to us to be a platform for growth. And with respect to Diamond, even at today's very low market price for Diamond, Loews still has $1 billion of exposure to the offshore drilling industry. So from a portfolio perspective, we're very comfortable with our exposure to and the upside potential for Diamond Offshore, and we're also happy to have a new subsidiary that has all the possibility that I spoke about in my remarks just a few minutes ago."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry.

I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. 
As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Container Company, or CCC, for $1.2 billion. The company is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia that makes containers for stable end markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. The acquisition of CCC will add a new industry to Loews' already diverse portfolio of businesses and provide a great foundation for expansion through organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. 
We've been analyzing the packaging industry for quite some time, getting to know it well and looking for the right deal, and we believe we found it. CCC is an outstanding company that checks all the boxes for Loews' criteria. 
First of all, the size of the investment meets the Goldilocks test. The $600 million check is just right, allowing us to feel comfortable about making add-on investments down the road. 
Aside from the size of the investment, the other check boxes are the fragmentation of the industry, the opportunity for add-on investments, their defensive position in consumer end markets, strong cash-on-cash returns and a highly qualified management team. 
Consolidated sector is the -- of the packaging industry is attractive to us for a number of reasons. The rigid plastic packaging sector is somewhat recession resistant in that its products are used primarily for nondiscretionary consumer items. And while there are evolutionary changes in the business, we believe it's unlikely that this sector will be subject to major technological disruption.
CCC is the largest national player in the small- to medium-volume segment of this industry, with 59 manufacturing facilities across the U.S. either co-located or close to their customers, a distinct advantage in minimizing transportation costs. The company has long-term client relationships with little turnover in its customer base. 
Over the last several years, CCC has focused on customers who have small but growing brands that have been challenging traditional incumbents in various product classes such as Seventh Generation cleaning products and Persil laundry detergents. 
A data point that will come as no surprise to our shareholders is that we especially like the steady cash flow characteristics of this sector. We anticipate near double-digit, cash-on-cash returns on our investment. CCC's free cash flow will, for the foreseeable future, be used either to pay down debt or to finance acquisitions. 
Finally, and most importantly, CCC has a strong and experienced management team with a track record of operational excellence. As I've said before, we kicked a lot of tires in this process, and we have yet to come across a management team as ready for prime time as CCC's. We look forward to working with its CEO, Sean Fallmann, and his team to profitably grow the company. 
The acquisition of CCC will be financed with approximately 50% cash and 50% debt at the CCC level. For Loews, this is a relatively small acquisition that allows us to continue to retain substantial liquidity at the parent company. After the close, Loews will still have approximately $5 billion of cash and investments. 
We expect the transaction to close later this month and will include partial quarter financial results for the Loews Packaging Group in our second quarter earnings release. 
As far as this quarter goes, I'm happy with our results and the progress of each of our subsidiaries. Our CFO, David Edelson, will now provide more details. Over to you, David."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter.

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year quarterly earnings improvement. These are also set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement. The supplement is available by webcast and has been posted to the Loews IR website. 
In summary, CNA had an excellent quarter and contributed the bulk of our net income, accounting for approximately 80% of the total. Similarly, CNA drove our year-over-year increase, with Boardwalk Pipeline, Loews Hotels and parent company investments also contributing. Diamond Offshore was the main earnings drag this quarter, given the ongoing difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market. 
Turning to the details. CNA's substantial increase in net income came on the back of strong net investment income, a lower retroactive reinsurance charge than in the prior year, a significant turnaround in realized gains and good underwriting results in its core P&C business, with especially favorable results in specialty and international. 
As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, CNA's results were depressed by 3 items: realized investment losses, which reduced our net income by $17 million; losses on LP investments, which reduced our net income by $7 million; and a retroactive reinsurance charge, which reduced our net income by $74 million. The charge was related to the transfer of the company's asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity in 2010. 
Taken together, these 3 items lowered CNA's contribution to our first quarter 2016 net income by $98 million. 
Conversely, in this year's first quarter, CNA posted realized investment gains, not losses, which benefited our net income by $20 million. CNA's LP investments returned 3.8%, benefiting our net income by $54 million. And while CNA booked a noncash retroactive reinsurance charge again this year, it was far smaller than last year's, reducing our net income by only $12 million versus last year's $74 million. So on a year-over-year basis, these 3 items accounted for $160 million of the $174 million increase in CNA's contribution to our net income in Q1 2017.
Away from these items, CNA showed improved results from current accident year P&C underwriting and from the Life & Group segment, offset in part by a lower level of favorable prior year development. 
Beyond CNA, our year-over-year earnings improvement was driven by Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and parent company investments, offset by earnings declines at Diamond. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased year-over-year by 19% or $6 million, as revenues were up from recently completed growth projects as well as favorable market conditions for the company's storage and parking & lending services. Boardwalk's excellent performance was highlighted by its net revenues being up 7% and EBITDA up 11%. 
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During the quarter, the company booked a gain on the sale of the JV property and wrote down its equity investment in another non-Orlando JV property. These 2 onetime items netted to add $6 million to Q1 2017 net income. Setting aside these items, net income at Loews Hotels increased $1 million year-over-year. 
The main downdraft in the quarter was from Diamond Offshore as the depressed conditions in the offshore drilling space continued. Diamond's contribution to our Q1 net income declined from $43 million last year to $12 million in this year's first quarter. This $31 million negative swing was largely attributable to 2 factors: Diamond received a onetime demobilization fee last year that increased Diamond's contribution to our Q1 2016 net income by $13 million; and Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 10%, excluding this demobilization fee, primarily due to fewer revenue-earning days. It is simply not possible for Diamond management to reduce expenses enough to compensate for the significant revenue declines it has experienced. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was strong in Q1 2017 as alternative investments and equities, including gold-related equities, drove $59 million of pretax investment income. In comparison, the parent company portfolio generated a loss in last year's first quarter as favorable results from gold-related equities were more than offset by unfavorable results from alternatives and other equities. 
Let me explain briefly the bump-up in our corporate expenses in the first quarter. Two items, expenses related to acquisition activity and the timing of bonus accruals, accounted for the lion's share of the increase. We expect to have additional acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter. 
As for bonuses, we will be accruing them ratably throughout the year this year, so this is simply a timing difference. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At March 31, the parent company portfolio totaled $5.6 billion, with 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company portfolio will decrease by just over $600 million upon the closing of the Consolidated Container transaction in May.
During the first quarter, we received $559 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $546 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Dividends received from CNA included a $2 per-share special dividend, which itself totaled $485 million. 
We had no share repurchase activity during the first quarter. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

Rather, we saw this as -- we saw CCC as an attractive investment for Loews Corporation. It's the exact opposite in many ways of Diamond. It's totally noncyclical compared to the extreme cyclicality of Diamond Offshore. It seems to us to be a platform for growth. And with respect to Diamond, even at today's very low market price for Diamond, Loews still has $1 billion of exposure to the offshore drilling industry. So from a portfolio perspective, we're very comfortable with our exposure to and the upside potential for Diamond Offshore, and we're also happy to have a new subsidiary that has all the possibility that I spoke about in my remarks just a few minutes ago."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry.

I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. 
As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Container Company, or CCC, for $1.2 billion. The company is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia that makes containers for stable end markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. The acquisition of CCC will add a new industry to Loews' already diverse portfolio of businesses and provide a great foundation for expansion through organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. 
We've been analyzing the packaging industry for quite some time, getting to know it well and looking for the right deal, and we believe we found it. CCC is an outstanding company that checks all the boxes for Loews' criteria. 
First of all, the size of the investment meets the Goldilocks test. The $600 million check is just right, allowing us to feel comfortable about making add-on investments down the road. 
Aside from the size of the investment, the other check boxes are the fragmentation of the industry, the opportunity for add-on investments, their defensive position in consumer end markets, strong cash-on-cash returns and a highly qualified management team. 
Consolidated sector is the -- of the packaging industry is attractive to us for a number of reasons. The rigid plastic packaging sector is somewhat recession resistant in that its products are used primarily for nondiscretionary consumer items. And while there are evolutionary changes in the business, we believe it's unlikely that this sector will be subject to major technological disruption.
CCC is the largest national player in the small- to medium-volume segment of this industry, with 59 manufacturing facilities across the U.S. either co-located or close to their customers, a distinct advantage in minimizing transportation costs. The company has long-term client relationships with little turnover in its customer base. 
Over the last several years, CCC has focused on customers who have small but growing brands that have been challenging traditional incumbents in various product classes such as Seventh Generation cleaning products and Persil laundry detergents. 
A data point that will come as no surprise to our shareholders is that we especially like the steady cash flow characteristics of this sector. We anticipate near double-digit, cash-on-cash returns on our investment. CCC's free cash flow will, for the foreseeable future, be used either to pay down debt or to finance acquisitions. 
Finally, and most importantly, CCC has a strong and experienced management team with a track record of operational excellence. As I've said before, we kicked a lot of tires in this process, and we have yet to come across a management team as ready for prime time as CCC's. We look forward to working with its CEO, Sean Fallmann, and his team to profitably grow the company. 
The acquisition of CCC will be financed with approximately 50% cash and 50% debt at the CCC level. For Loews, this is a relatively small acquisition that allows us to continue to retain substantial liquidity at the parent company. After the close, Loews will still have approximately $5 billion of cash and investments. 
We expect the transaction to close later this month and will include partial quarter financial results for the Loews Packaging Group in our second quarter earnings release. 
As far as this quarter goes, I'm happy with our results and the progress of each of our subsidiaries. Our CFO, David Edelson, will now provide more details. Over to you, David."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter.

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year quarterly earnings improvement. These are also set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement. The supplement is available by webcast and has been posted to the Loews IR website. 
In summary, CNA had an excellent quarter and contributed the bulk of our net income, accounting for approximately 80% of the total. Similarly, CNA drove our year-over-year increase, with Boardwalk Pipeline, Loews Hotels and parent company investments also contributing. Diamond Offshore was the main earnings drag this quarter, given the ongoing difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market. 
Turning to the details. CNA's substantial increase in net income came on the back of strong net investment income, a lower retroactive reinsurance charge than in the prior year, a significant turnaround in realized gains and good underwriting results in its core P&C business, with especially favorable results in specialty and international. 
As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, CNA's results were depressed by 3 items: realized investment losses, which reduced our net income by $17 million; losses on LP investments, which reduced our net income by $7 million; and a retroactive reinsurance charge, which reduced our net income by $74 million. The charge was related to the transfer of the company's asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity in 2010. 
Taken together, these 3 items lowered CNA's contribution to our first quarter 2016 net income by $98 million. 
Conversely, in this year's first quarter, CNA posted realized investment gains, not losses, which benefited our net income by $20 million. CNA's LP investments returned 3.8%, benefiting our net income by $54 million. And while CNA booked a noncash retroactive reinsurance charge again this year, it was far smaller than last year's, reducing our net income by only $12 million versus last year's $74 million. So on a year-over-year basis, these 3 items accounted for $160 million of the $174 million increase in CNA's contribution to our net income in Q1 2017.
Away from these items, CNA showed improved results from current accident year P&C underwriting and from the Life & Group segment, offset in part by a lower level of favorable prior year development. 
Beyond CNA, our year-over-year earnings improvement was driven by Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and parent company investments, offset by earnings declines at Diamond. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased year-over-year by 19% or $6 million, as revenues were up from recently completed growth projects as well as favorable market conditions for the company's storage and parking & lending services. Boardwalk's excellent performance was highlighted by its net revenues being up 7% and EBITDA up 11%. 
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During the quarter, the company booked a gain on the sale of the JV property and wrote down its equity investment in another non-Orlando JV property. These 2 onetime items netted to add $6 million to Q1 2017 net income. Setting aside these items, net income at Loews Hotels increased $1 million year-over-year. 
The main downdraft in the quarter was from Diamond Offshore as the depressed conditions in the offshore drilling space continued. Diamond's contribution to our Q1 net income declined from $43 million last year to $12 million in this year's first quarter. This $31 million negative swing was largely attributable to 2 factors: Diamond received a onetime demobilization fee last year that increased Diamond's contribution to our Q1 2016 net income by $13 million; and Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 10%, excluding this demobilization fee, primarily due to fewer revenue-earning days. It is simply not possible for Diamond management to reduce expenses enough to compensate for the significant revenue declines it has experienced. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was strong in Q1 2017 as alternative investments and equities, including gold-related equities, drove $59 million of pretax investment income. In comparison, the parent company portfolio generated a loss in last year's first quarter as favorable results from gold-related equities were more than offset by unfavorable results from alternatives and other equities. 
Let me explain briefly the bump-up in our corporate expenses in the first quarter. Two items, expenses related to acquisition activity and the timing of bonus accruals, accounted for the lion's share of the increase. We expect to have additional acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter. 
As for bonuses, we will be accruing them ratably throughout the year this year, so this is simply a timing difference. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At March 31, the parent company portfolio totaled $5.6 billion, with 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company portfolio will decrease by just over $600 million upon the closing of the Consolidated Container transaction in May.
During the first quarter, we received $559 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $546 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Dividends received from CNA included a $2 per-share special dividend, which itself totaled $485 million. 
We had no share repurchase activity during the first quarter. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

Rather, we saw this as -- we saw CCC as an attractive investment for Loews Corporation. It's the exact opposite in many ways of Diamond. It's totally noncyclical compared to the extreme cyclicality of Diamond Offshore. It seems to us to be a platform for growth. And with respect to Diamond, even at today's very low market price for Diamond, Loews still has $1 billion of exposure to the offshore drilling industry. So from a portfolio perspective, we're very comfortable with our exposure to and the upside potential for Diamond Offshore, and we're also happy to have a new subsidiary that has all the possibility that I spoke about in my remarks just a few minutes ago."

But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results as once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice o",886,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had of great quarter and operating results were strong across of the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results as once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice of speaking in detail on a single topic of interest. 
Specifically, I'd like to talk a bit about the benefits and diversification with regard to our portfolio of businesses using the recent histories of CNA and Diamond Offshore as example. 
It's long been our belief that having a diversified portfolio of businesses subject to different market cycles offers the best way to deliver superior returns over the long term. However, operating in diverse industries does mean that at any given time, our subsidiaries can face vastly different market environments, some hospitable and others more challenging. CNA and Diamond today illustrate the point. 
Over the last few years, CNA has been on the upswing while Diamond now operates an industry facing and productive down cycle.
Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property casualty insurance market. Over the last year, CNA's total return to shareholders was more than 70%. While CNA was just a strong financially a year ago as it is today, the market seems to have finally caught on. 
A little less than 20 years ago, CNA was an insurance company that had lots it's way, trying to be all things to all people with no focused strategy. 
Today, the company has been transformed into a consistently profitable commercial P&C insurance carrier with strong operating results in an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. 
Let me give you a little history.  Steve, CNA's CEO from 2001 to '09 had the arduous task of streamlining the company. He divested certain lines of business that were not core to CNA such as reinsurance, life insurance and personals line. It sounds easier in retrospect, but at the time, it was growing and Steve did an excellent job riding the ship. 
When Steve retired in '09, Tom Motamed became the CEO. He focused CNA on improving its market position in specialty and commercial lines, creating a culture of underwriting discipline and making sure that the company had adequate reserves. This new direction helped fortify CNA's balance sheet, which remains rock solid to this day.
In November of last year, industry veteran, Dino Robusto joined CNA, ready, willing, able and jumping at the bits to lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability. CNA's long-standing goal is to post best in class underwriting results and it's getting closer to that achievement every day. 
CNA's loss ratio is basically in line with, if not better than, it's top-tier competitors. 
However, its expense ratio tends to be higher than its competition, which management is addressing. 
The bottom line is that while CNA have come a long way, we believe there's still ample runway for value creation, and we believe that Dino with his energy, experience and vision is the right individual to get the job done. If you look at CNA's earnings results for this quarter, you'll see he's already been hard at work. The company had a combined ratio of 93.5%, primarily due to improved underwriting performance. 
In stark contrast to CNA's upswing, Diamond Offshore is operating in an industry that continues to face one of the sharpest down turns in its history. Contracts have been canceled, leading edge day rates are often times at or below operating cost and oil prices remain well below levels of a few years ago. 
Despite the pain, Diamond's CEO, Mark Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, scale and determination. 
And while the short to medium-term outlook for the offshore drilling market remains bleak diamond has maintained its relative strength and all of its new build drilling rigs are operating under long-term contracts at an average rate of $450,000 per day. 
The company has also been exploring new ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide better value to its customers. 
While we don't know exactly when the offshore drilling market will recover, we do not doubt the inevitability of a recovery. Steep declines in existing oil fields will hit the market in the next few years and growth in offshore oil production will be needed to meet demand. Offshore oil is a significant part of the global supply mix that we believe cannot and will not be replaced by conventional offshore drilling or shale production. 
Today, we are seeing the famous of green shoots as the offshore drilling industry moves towards product standardization and simplification.
So in conclusion, let's remember that it was only about 5 years ago that Diamond was Loews' largest subsidiary by market value, supplying the lion share of our cash flow. Back then, CNA was just beginning its rise. Yet today, the roles are reversed. Oiling companies and a variety of industries offers a safeguards to shareholders against volatility in any one sector. 
Looking back at our history, we can clearly see that operating in diverse industries have given Loews a distinct advantage in its quest to create long-term value for its shareholders, a commitment that has defied Loews for more than 50 years. And now, over to David"
285930,530319979,1259411,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2017",2017-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning.

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter. 
Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the bulk of the $296 million year-over-year positive earnings win, while parent company investment income was the main detractor versus the prior year. 
Lower rig impairments at Diamond contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Rig impairments reduced Loews' net income in Q2 2016 by $267 million, whereas in this year's second quarter, the impairment hit dropped to $23 million. 
Excluding the Diamond impairments, Loews' net income was $254 million in Q2 2017, up from $202 million in Q2 2016.
The key drivers for the quarter are set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement, which has been posted to our Investor Relations website. 
CNA had an excellent quarter and was, by far, the largest contributor to our consolidated net income at $244 million. This represents a $55 million or 29% year-to-year  increase. 
Two factors drove this increase, stronger P&C underwriting income and higher realized investment gains. Net investment income was, in fact, down slightly year-over-year, given a modest fall off in LP results. 
The improvement in P&C underwriting income came from a meaningfully lower combined ratio. CNA's calendar year combined ratio declined from 97.4 in Q2 2016 to 93.5 in this year's second quarter, a 3.9-point improvement on $1.6 billion of quarterly net earned premiums.
Given the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development essentially offset one another this quarter, I would highlight the improvement in CNA's combined ratio, excluding CAT in prior year development, also known as the non-CAT accident year combined ratio. 
Specifically, the company's non-CAT accident year combined ratio dropped to 3.7 points from 98.3 in Q2 2016 to 94.6 in this year's second quarter. All three of CNA's P&C segments, Specialty, Commercial and International, showed excellent year-over-year improvement. 
The improvement was particularly notable in the company's commercial old and International segments as those non-CAT accident year combined ratios dropped by 3.2 points and 14.2 points, respectively.
This quarter highlights CNA's enhanced underwriting discipline, its ongoing favorable prior development and its focus on expense control. Dino Robusto and his team are singularly focused on continual improvement across CNA, building on the solid foundation created by Tom Motamed during his tenure as CEO. 
Turning to Diamond officer. While Diamond contributed only $7 million to our net income this quarter, that is over $300 million more than last year's second quarter. The previously mentioned rig impairments accounted for most of the year-over-year swing. 
That said, even after excluding the impairment charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income increased $57 million year-over-year, driven mainly by higher contract drilling revenues, strong cost controls, reduced depreciation expense owing to last year's rig impairments and a lower effective tax rate.
Boardwalk posted excellent results in the quarter after excluding a one-time loss associated with the sale of a gas processing facility and related gathering assets. The loss decreased Boardwalk's contribution to our net income by $15 million. Thus, accounting for the year-to-year decline in net income contribution.  Absent this loss, however, Boardwalk would have contributed $21 million to our Q2 2017 net income versus $17 million last year. And remember that in last year's second quarter, Boardwalk benefited from a legal settlement that increased its net income contribution by $4 million.
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter with net income of $10 million. During last year's second quarter, the company wrote down an equity investment in one of its joint-venture hotel properties. So while the year-over-year net income comparison was still favorable, it's not as dramatic as it first appears. 
The hotel companies adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the write down and other nonrecurring items, was $61 million for the quarter, up from $56 million in Q2 2016.
The increase was principally driven by Loews Hotels joint venture properties at the Universal Orlando Resort. Our earnings supplement include the definition of adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was weak in Q2's 2017 as a results from gold-related equities were down meaningfully versus the prior year as where results from other equity strategies. 
While our holdings of gold-related equities can be volatile from one period to another, we have under 3% of parent company cash and investments devoted to this asset class. 
And overtime, these investments have performed as intended within the context of the overall parent company portfolio.
As you know, we closed on the purchase of Consolidated Container Company on May 22. In the segment results and Page 5 of our release, CCC's revenues for the period of our ownership are included in investment income and other. CCC's pretax net income are included in corporate. 
CCC essentially broke even during the first 6 weeks of our ownership as the company's income was negatively affected by deal-related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting entries. Please note that we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. We expect to show CCC as its own reporting segment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At June 30, post the funding of the CCC acquisition, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion with approximately 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. 
During the second quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries including $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
CNA announced this morning that it had increased its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, which translates into an incremental $12 million per quarter to Loews. This dividend hike is yet further evidence of CNA's rock solid capital position and its improving operating performance.

Man, oh, man. I lost my paper. There we go. Thank you, David. 
Before we turn the call over to Mary, I want to bring up a question that I think is top of mind for most of you, namely: Why hasn't Loews bought back more shares considering that some of the products discount is the highest it's been in a number of years? 
As I'm sure you know, we're well aware of Loews' in some of the parts valuation. In fact, it's something that I track constantly. Judging by the increase on our stock price over the past 9 months, it certainly, seems that we should have been more active repurchasing our stock. 
What's other stock is that while Loews almost only seems relatively cheap and even more so now given the widening discount, the market still seems very high to us. We've been nervous about the equity market for a while, and we've been struggling to reconcile our view of the markets absolute level with a relative value of Loews' stock. 
As you know, we take a long-term view on share repurchases. We'll look for opportunities to repurchase Loews stock when both its relative and absolute value are attractive. We know that if a stock market declines, our share rise will likely move in the same direction. 
So given our nervousness about the stock market, we've been waiting for a time to repurchase shares at a more advantageous price. 
Some of you may think we made maybe too cautious. You maybe right. Only time will tell. Historically though, we have shown that once we are comfortable buying back shares, we buy back a lot of them. In the last 2 years, our buyback may have seen anemic, but over just the last 5 years, we bought back 14% of our outstanding shares at a cost at approximately $2.5 billion. Clearly, repurchasing our shares remains an important way that we allocate capital to create shareholder value. 
And now I'd like to hand the call back to Mary"

What we do know is that shale oil production is up rather significantly in the past year. And the general forecast is U.S. shale oil production can increase by about 1 million barrels per day every year. The question is, for how many years will U.S. shale production be able to increase at that rate? And the other question is, what's going to happen to worldwide oil consumption? And most importantly, in my mind, what's going to happen to worldwide oil depletion? Our guess is that the underinvestment in oil exploration and production over the past 3 years is going to start to take its toll as projects that were completed before that period start to come online and start to deplete. And it's our view that in the coming years, there will be a significant need for the offshore oil that has provided up to 30% of the worldwide oil supply. So I would say that we feel like right now, even if you didn't ask about it, right now, we're balancing along at the bottom with respect to offshore oil drilling. But we believe that there are, as I said, a few green shoots. And we think that in the coming months and years, there will be more."

The fact that there's a lot of complacency in all markets, not just the equity markets leaves me -- and I'm pleased to say, a significant number of other market commentators to the view that this complacency that we're seeing in the market can lead to a decline in equity values.  When most investors buy Loews shares, if they change their mind, if they get nervous about the market, they can turn around and sell those shares. In the company buys new shares, we buy them forever. And so what we are trying to do when we buy our shares, is to buy them at the cheapest price we can purchase them at. I understand there are a lot of companies that repurchase their shares. They do it according to a program and they know ever quarter -- they budgeted so and so many dollars to buy in their shares. That's not the way we are roll. I will stand firmly behind, and I am proud of, our repurchase record that goes back to the '70s. We bought shares at attractive prices over that time period. And in that time period, probably retired in excess of 75% of our then outstanding shares. So yes, it is possible that I'm being a bit stubborn, that the market is going to go up from here. But we've got to do what we think is right for all the shareholders. And our guess, at this point in time, is as it has been, not to spend our corporate cash on share repurchases.

Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice",882,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice of speaking in detail on a single topic of interest. Specifically, I'd like to talk a bit about the benefits of diversification with regard to our portfolio of businesses, using the recent histories of CNA and Diamond Offshore as examples. 
It has long been our belief that having a diversified portfolio of businesses subject to different market cycles offers the best way to deliver superior returns over the long term. However, operating in diverse industries does mean that, at any given time, our subsidiaries can face vastly different market environments, some hospitable and others more challenging. CNA and Diamond today illustrate the point. Over the last few years, CNA has been on the upswing while Diamond now operates in an industry facing a protracted down cycle.
Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property/casualty insurance market. Over the last year, CNA's total return to shareholders was more than 70%. While CNA was just as strong financially a year ago as it is today, the market seems to have finally caught on. A little less than 20 years ago, CNA was an insurance company that had lost its way, trying to be all things to all people with no focused strategy. Today, the company has been transformed into a consistently profitable commercial P&C insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. 
Let me give you a little history. Steve Lilienthal, CNA's CEO from 2001 to '09, had the arduous task of streamlining the company. He divested certain lines of business that were not core to CNA, such as reinsurance, life insurance and personal lines. It sounds easier in retrospect, but at the time, it was grueling, and Steve did an excellent job riding the ship. 
When Steve retired in '09, Tom Motamed became the CEO. He focused CNA on improving its market position in specialty and commercial lines, creating a culture of underwriting discipline and making sure that the company had adequate reserves. This new direction helped fortify CNA's balance sheet, which remains rock solid to this day. 
In November of last year, industry veteran Dino Robusto joined CNA, ready, willing, able and chomping at the bits to lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability. CNA's long-standing goal is to post best-in-class underwriting results, and it's getting closer to that achievement every day. CNA's loss ratio is basically in line with, if not better than, its top-tier competitors. However, its expense ratio tends to be higher than its competition, which management is addressing. 
The bottom line is that while CNA have come a long way, we believe there is still ample runway for value creation, and we believe that Dino with his energy, experience and vision is the right individual to get the job done.  If you look at CNA's earnings results for this quarter, you'll see he's already been hard at work. The company had a combined ratio of 93.5%, primarily due to improved underwriting performance.  
In stark contrast to CNA's upswing, Diamond Offshore is operating in an industry that continues to face one of the sharpest downturns in its history. Contracts have been canceled. Leading-edge day rates are oftentimes at or below operating costs, and oil prices remained well below levels of a few years ago. 
Despite the pain, Diamond's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, scale and determination. And while the short- to medium-term outlook for the offshore drilling market remains bleak, Diamond has maintained its relative strength, and all of its newbuild drilling rigs are operating under long-term contracts at an average rate of $450,000 per day. 
The company has also been exploring new ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide better value to its customers. 
While we don't know exactly when the offshore drilling market will recover, we do not doubt the inevitability of a recovery. Steep declines in existing oilfields will hit the market in the next few years, and growth in offshore oil production will be needed to meet demand. Offshore oil is a significant part of the global supply mix that we believe cannot and will not be replaced by conventional offshore drilling or shale production. 
Today, we are seeing the faintest of green shoots as the offshore drilling industry moves towards product standardization and simplification.
So in conclusion, let's remember that it was only about 5 years ago that Diamond was Loews' largest subsidiary by market value, supplying the lion's share of our cash flow. Back then, CNA was just beginning its rise. Yet today, the roles have reversed. Owning companies in a variety of industries offers a safeguard to shareholders against volatility in any one sector. Looking back at our history, we can clearly see that operating in diverse industries has given Loews a distinct advantage in its quest to create long-term value for its shareholders, a commitment that has defined Loews for more than 50 years. 
And now over to David"
285930,530319979,1259475,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2017",2017-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the b",1001,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the bulk of the $296 million year-over-year positive earnings win while parent company investment income was the main detractor versus the prior year. 
Lower rig impairments at Diamond contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Rig impairments reduced Loews' net income in Q2 2016 by $267 million, whereas in this year's second quarter, the impairment hit dropped to $23 million. Excluding the Diamond impairments, Loews' net income was $254 million in Q2 2017, up from $202 million in Q2 2016.
The key drivers for the quarter are set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement, which has been posted to our Investor Relations website. CNA had an excellent quarter and was, by far, the largest contributor to our consolidated net income at $244 million. This represents a $55 million or 29% year-to-year increase. 
Two factors drove this increase: stronger P&C underwriting income and higher realized investment gains. Net investment income was, in fact, down slightly year-over-year, given a modest falloff in LP results. The improvement in P&C underwriting income came from a meaningfully lower combined ratio. CNA's calendar year combined ratio declined from 97.4% in Q2 2016 to 93.5% in this year's second quarter, a 3.9 point improvement on $1.6 billion of quarterly net earned premiums.
Given that catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development essentially offset one another this quarter, I would highlight the improvement in CNA's combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development, also known as the non-cat accident year combined ratio. Specifically, the company's non-cat accident year combined ratio dropped 3.7 points from 98.3% in Q2 2016 to 94.6% in this year's second quarter. All 3 of CNA's P&C segments, specialty, commercial and international, showed excellent year-over-year improvement. The improvement was particularly notable in the company's commercial and international segments as those non-cat accident year combined ratios dropped by 3.2 points and 14.2 points, respectively.
This quarter highlights CNA's enhanced underwriting discipline, its ongoing favorable prior year development and its focus on expense control. Dino Robusto and his team are singularly focused on continual improvement across CNA, building on the solid foundation created by Tom Motamed during his tenure as CEO. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. While Diamond contributed only $7 million to our net income this quarter, that is over $300 million more than last year's second quarter. The previously mentioned rig impairments accounted for most of the year-over-year swing. That said, even after excluding the impairment charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income increased $57 million year-over-year, driven mainly by higher contract drilling revenues, strong cost controls, reduced depreciation expense owing to last year's rig impairments and a lower effective tax rate.
Boardwalk posted excellent results in the quarter after excluding a onetime loss associated with the sale of a gas processing facility and related gathering assets. The loss decreased Boardwalk's contribution to our net income by $15 million, thus accounting for the year-to-year decline in net income contribution.  Absent this loss, however, Boardwalk would have contributed $21 million to our Q2 2017 net income versus $17 million last year. And remember that in last year's second quarter, Boardwalk benefited from a legal settlement that increased its net income contribution by $4 million.
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During last year's second quarter, the company wrote down an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. So while the year-over-year net income comparison was still favorable, it's not as dramatic as it first appears. 
The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the write-down and other nonrecurring items, was $61 million for the quarter, up from $56 million in Q2 2016. The increase was principally driven by Loews Hotels joint venture properties at the Universal Orlando Resort. Our earnings supplement includes the definition of adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was weak in Q2 2017 as results from gold-related equities were down meaningfully versus the prior year as were results from other equity strategies. 
While our holdings of gold-related equities can be volatile from one period to another, we have under 3% of parent company cash and investments devoted to this asset class, and over time, these investments have performed as intended within the context of the overall parent company portfolio.
As you know, we closed on the purchase of Consolidated Container Company on May 22. In the segment results on Page 5 of our release, CCC's revenues for the period of our ownership are included in investment income and other. CCC's pretax net income are included in corporate. 
CCC essentially broke even during the first 6 weeks of our ownership as the company's income was negatively affected by deal-related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting entries. Please note that we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. We expect to show CCC as its own reporting segment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At June 30, post the funding of the CCC acquisition, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, with approximately 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. 
During the second quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
CNA announced this morning that it has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, which translates into an incremental $12 million per quarter to Loews. This dividend hike is yet further evidence of CNA's rock-solid capital position and its improving operating performance.

Man, oh man, I lost my pages. There we go. Thank you, David. 
Before we turn the call over to Mary, I want to bring up a question that I think is top of mind for most of you, namely, Why hasn't Loews bought back more shares considering that the sum-of-the-parts discount is the highest it's been in a number of years? As I'm sure you know, we are well aware of Loews' sum-of-the-parts valuation. In fact, it's something that I track constantly. Judging by the increase on our stock price over the past 9 months, it certainly seems that we should have been more active repurchasing our stock. 
What's held us back is that while Loews almost always seems relatively cheap and even more so now, given the widening discount, the market still seems very high to us. We've been nervous about the equity market for a while, and we've been struggling to reconcile our view of the market's absolute level with the relative value of Loews' stock. 
As you know, we take a long-term view on share repurchases. We'll look for opportunities to repurchase Loews stock when both its relative and absolute values are attractive. We know that if the stock market declines, our share price will likely move in the same direction. So given our nervousness about the stock market, we've been waiting for a time to repurchase shares at a more advantageous price. 
Some of you may think we may be too cautious. You may be right. Only time will tell. Historically, though, we have shown that once we are comfortable buying back shares, we back -- buy back a lot of them. In the last 2 years, our buybacks may have seemed anemic, but over just the last 5 years, we bought back 14% of our outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Clearly, repurchasing our shares remains an important way that we allocate capital to create shareholder value. 
And now I'd like to hand the call back to Mary"

I haven't followed it recently. What we do know is that shale oil production is up rather significantly in the past year, and the general forecast is that U.S. shale oil production can increase by about 1 million barrels per day every year. The question is, for how many years will U.S. shale production be able to increase at that rate? And the other question is, what's going to happen to worldwide oil consumption? And most importantly, in my mind, what's going to happen to worldwide oil depletion? Our guess is that the underinvestment in oil exploration and production over the past 3 years is going to start to take its toll as projects that were completed before that period start to come online and start to deplete. And it's our view that in the coming years, there will be a significant need for the offshore oil that has provided up to 30% of the worldwide oil supply. So I would say that we feel that, right now -- even though you didn't ask about it, we feel that right now we're bouncing along at the bottom with respect to offshore oil drilling. But we believe that there are, as I said, a few green shoots, and we think that in the coming months and years, there'll be more."

That's equipment that's generally third- and fourth-generation rigs where there has been an assessment by the individual owners that those rigs -- it is not worthwhile for them to store those rigs with a hope and expectation that in a number of years, they will be able to come back into the market. There's general agreement that there are more than enough fifth- and six-generation rigs in order to satisfy the future demand for drilling assets over the coming 5 years. So I think that it's very possible that some of that scrapping will continue. But I think the important thing to look at is not the scrapping but rather what percent of the fleet is operating and how much of the fifth- and sixth-generation fleets are stacked and what will be the cost to be able to bring those rigs out of the stack mode when, as and if the demand increases."

I don't think that Loews, in any way, is overpriced versus the stock market. But the stock market trading at 17, 18 or 19x earnings, the fact that interest rates are still as low as they are when we were seeing economic growth of 2.5%, the fact that there's a lot of complacency in all markets, not just the equity markets leads me and I'm pleased to say a significant number of other market commentators to the view that this complacency that we're seeing in the market can lead to a decline in equity values. We -- when most investors buy Loews shares, if they change their mind, if they get nervous about the market, they can turn around and sell those shares. When the company buys the shares, we buy them forever. And so what we are trying to do when we buy our shares is to buy them at the cheapest price we can purchase them at. I understand there are a lot of companies that repurchase their shares. They do it according to a program, and they know every quarter they're going to -- they've budgeted so and so many dollars to buy in their shares. That's not the way we roll. We -- I will stand firmly behind and I am proud of our repurchase record that goes back to the '70s. We bought shares at attractive prices over that time period and, in that time period, have probably retired in excess of 75% of our then outstanding shares. So yes, it is possible that I'm being a bit stubborn, that the market is going to go up from here, but we've got to do what we think is right for all the shareholders. And our guess, at this point in time, is as it has been, not to spend our corporate cash on share repurchases. That can change at any point in time without any notice to shareholders, but it's how we come out after assessing all the factors that we consider."

285930,530319979,1259521,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2017",2017-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice",878,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice of speaking in detail on a single topic of interest. Specifically, I'd like to talk a bit about the benefits of diversification with regard to our portfolio of businesses, using the recent histories of CNA and Diamond Offshore as examples. 
It has long been our belief that having a diversified portfolio of businesses subject to different market cycles offers the best way to deliver superior returns over the long term. However, operating in diverse industries does mean that, at any given time, our subsidiaries can face vastly different market environments, some hospitable and others more challenging. CNA and Diamond today illustrate the point. Over the last few years, CNA has been on the upswing while Diamond now operates in an industry facing a protracted down cycle.
Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property/casualty insurance market. Over the last year, CNA's total return to shareholders was more than 70%. While CNA was just as strong financially a year ago as it is today, the market seems to have finally caught on. A little less than 20 years ago, CNA was an insurance company that had lost its way, trying to be all things to all people with no focused strategy. Today, the company has been transformed into a consistently profitable commercial P&C insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. 
Let me give you a little history. Steve Lilienthal, CNA's CEO from 2001 to '09, had the arduous task of streamlining the company. He divested certain lines of business that were not core to CNA, such as reinsurance, life insurance and personal lines. It sounds easier in retrospect, but at the time, it was grueling, and Steve did an excellent job righting the ship. 
When Steve retired in '09, Tom Motamed became the CEO. He focused CNA on improving its market position in specialty and commercial lines, creating a culture of underwriting discipline and making sure that the company had adequate reserves. This new direction helped fortify CNA's balance sheet, which remains rock solid to this day. 
In November of last year, industry veteran Dino Robusto joined CNA, ready, willing, able and chomping-at-the-bit to lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability. CNA's long-standing goal is to post best-in-class underwriting results, and it's getting closer to that achievement every day. CNA's loss ratio is basically in-line with, if not better than, its top-tier competitors. However, its expense ratio tends to be higher than its competition, which management is addressing. 
The bottom line is that while CNA have come a long way, we believe there is still ample runway for value creation, and we believe that Dino, with his energy, experience and vision, is the right individual to get the job done.  If you look at CNA's earnings results for this quarter, you'll see he's already been hard at work. The company had a combined ratio of 93.5%, primarily due to improved underwriting performance.  
In stark contrast to CNA's upswing, Diamond Offshore is operating in an industry that continues to face one of the sharpest downturns in its history. Contracts have been canceled. Leading-edge day rates are oftentimes at or below operating costs, and oil prices remain well below levels of a few years ago. 
Despite the pain, Diamond's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, scale and determination. And while the short- to medium-term outlook for the offshore drilling market remains bleak, Diamond has maintained its relative strength, and all of its newbuild drilling rigs are operating under long-term contracts at an average rate of $450,000 per day. 
The company has also been exploring new ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide better value to its customers. 
While we don't know exactly when the offshore drilling market will recover, we do not doubt the inevitability of a recovery. Steep declines in existing oilfields will hit the market in the next few years, and growth in offshore oil production will be needed to meet demand. Offshore oil is a significant part of the global supply mix that we believe cannot and will not be replaced by conventional offshore drilling or shale production. 
Today, we are seeing the faintest of green shoots as the offshore drilling industry moves towards product standardization and simplification.
So in conclusion, let's remember that it was only about 5 years ago that Diamond was Loews' largest subsidiary by market value, supplying the lion's share of our cash flow. Back then, CNA was just beginning its rise. Yet today, the roles are reversed. Owning companies in a variety of industries offers a safeguard to shareholders against volatility in any one sector. Looking back at our history, we can clearly see that operating in diverse industries has given Loews a distinct advantage in its quest to create long-term value for its shareholders, a commitment that has defined Loews for more than 50 years. 
And now over to David"
285930,530319979,1259521,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2017",2017-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the b",1000,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the bulk of the $296 million year-over-year positive earnings win while parent company investment income was the main detractor versus the prior year. 
Lower rig impairments at Diamond contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Rig impairments reduced Loews' net income in Q2 2016 by $267 million, whereas in this year's second quarter, the impairment hit dropped to $23 million. Excluding the Diamond impairments, Loews' net income was $254 million in Q2 2017, up from $202 million in Q2 2016.
The key drivers for the quarter are set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement, which has been posted to our Investor Relations website. CNA had an excellent quarter and was, by far, the largest contributor to our consolidated net income at $244 million. This represents a $55 million or 29% year-to-year increase. 
Two factors drove this increase: stronger P&C underwriting income and higher realized investment gains. Net investment income was, in fact, down slightly year-over-year, given a modest falloff in LP results. The improvement in P&C underwriting income came from a meaningfully lower combined ratio. CNA's calendar year combined ratio declined from 97.4% in Q2 2016 to 93.5% in this year's second quarter, a 3.9 point improvement on $1.6 billion of quarterly net earned premiums.
Given that catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development essentially offset one another this quarter, I would highlight the improvement in CNA's combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development, also known as the non-cat accident year combined ratio. Specifically, the company's non-cat accident year combined ratio dropped 3.7 points from 98.3% in Q2 2016 to 94.6% in this year's second quarter. All 3 of CNA's P&C segments, specialty, commercial and international, showed excellent year-over-year improvement. The improvement was particularly notable in the company's commercial and international segments as those non-cat accident year combined ratios dropped by 3.2 points and 14.2 points, respectively.
This quarter highlights CNA's enhanced underwriting discipline, its ongoing favorable prior year development and its focus on expense control. Dino Robusto and his team are singularly focused on continual improvement across CNA, building on the solid foundation created by Tom Motamed during his tenure as CEO. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. While Diamond contributed only $7 million to our net income this quarter, that is over $300 million more than last year's second quarter. The previously mentioned rig impairments accounted for most of the year-over-year swing. That said, even after excluding the impairment charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income increased $57 million year-over-year, driven mainly by higher contract drilling revenues, strong cost controls, reduced depreciation expense owing to last year's rig impairments and a lower effective tax rate.
Boardwalk posted excellent results in the quarter after excluding a onetime loss associated with the sale of a gas processing facility and related gathering assets. The loss decreased Boardwalk's contribution to our net income by $15 million, thus accounting for the year-to-year decline in net income contribution.  Absent this loss, however, Boardwalk would have contributed $21 million to our Q2 2017 net income versus $17 million last year. And remember that in last year's second quarter, Boardwalk benefited from a legal settlement that increased its net income contribution by $4 million.
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During last year's second quarter, the company wrote down an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. So while the year-over-year net income comparison was still favorable, it's not as dramatic as it first appears. 
The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the write-down and other nonrecurring items, was $61 million for the quarter, up from $56 million in Q2 2016. The increase was principally driven by Loews Hotels joint venture properties at the Universal Orlando Resort. Our earnings supplement includes the definition of adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was weak in Q2 2017 as results from gold-related equities were down meaningfully versus the prior year as were results from other equity strategies. 
While our holdings of gold-related equities can be volatile from one period to another, we have under 3% of parent company cash and investments devoted to this asset class, and over time, these investments have performed as intended within the context of the overall parent company portfolio.
As you know, we closed on the purchase of Consolidated Container Company on May 22. In the segment results on Page 5 of our release, CCC's revenues for the period of our ownership are included in investment income and other. CCC's pretax net income are included in corporate. 
CCC essentially broke-even during the first 6 weeks of our ownership as the company's income was negatively affected by deal-related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting entries. Please note that we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. We expect to show CCC as its own reporting segment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At June 30, post the funding of the CCC acquisition, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, with approximately 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. 
During the second quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
CNA announced this morning that it has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, which translates into an incremental $12 million per quarter to Loews. This dividend hike is yet further evidence of CNA's rock-solid capital position and its improving operating performance.
I will now hand the call back to Jim"

Man, oh man, I lost my pages. There we go. Thank you, David. 
Before we turn the call over to Mary, I want to bring up a question that I think is top of mind for most of you, namely, Why hasn't Loews bought back more shares considering that the sum-of-the-parts discount is the highest it's been in a number of years? As I'm sure you know, we are well aware of Loews' sum-of-the-parts valuation. In fact, it's something that I track constantly. Judging by the increase on our stock price over the past 9 months, it certainly seems that we should have been more active repurchasing our stock. 
What's held us back is that while Loews almost always seems relatively cheap and even more so now, given the widening discount, the market still seems very high to us. We've been nervous about the equity market for a while, and we've been struggling to reconcile our view of the market's absolute level with the relative value of Loews' stock. 
As you know, we take a long-term view on share repurchases. We look for opportunities to repurchase Loews stock when both its relative and absolute values are attractive. We know that if the stock market declines, our share price will likely move in the same direction. So given our nervousness about the stock market, we've been waiting for a time to repurchase shares at a more advantageous price. 
Some of you may think we may be too cautious. You may be right. Only time will tell. Historically, though, we have shown that once we are comfortable buying back shares, we back -- buy back a lot of them. In the last 2 years, our buybacks may have seemed anemic, but over just the last 5 years, we've bought back 14% of our outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Clearly, repurchasing our shares remains an important way that we allocate capital to create shareholder value. 
And now I'd like to hand the call back to Mary"

And most importantly, in my mind, what's going to happen to worldwide oil depletion? Our guess is that the underinvestment in oil exploration and production over the past 3 years is going to start to take its toll as projects that were completed before that period start to come online and start to deplete. And it's our view that in the coming years, there will be a significant need for the offshore oil that has provided up to 30% of the worldwide oil supply.

That's equipment that's generally third- and fourth-generation rigs where there has been an assessment by the individual owners that those rigs -- it is not worthwhile for them to store those rigs with a hope and expectation that in a number of years, they will be able to come back into the market. There's general agreement that there are more than enough fifth- and six-generation rigs in order to satisfy the future demand for drilling assets over the coming 5 years. So I think that it's very possible that some of that scrapping will continue. But I think the important thing to look at is not the scrapping but rather what percent of the fleet is operating and how much of the fifth- and sixth-generation fleets are stacked and what will be the cost to be able to bring those rigs out of the stack mode when, as and if the demand increases."

I don't think that Loews, in any way, is overpriced versus the stock market. But the stock market trading at 17, 18 or 19x earnings, the fact that interest rates are still as low as they are when we were seeing economic growth of 2.5%, the fact that there's a lot of complacency in all markets, not just the equity markets leads me and I'm pleased to say a significant number of other market commentators to the view that this complacency that we're seeing in the market can lead to a decline in equity values. We -- when most investors buy Loews shares, if they change their mind, if they get nervous about the market, they can turn around and sell those shares. When the company buys in the shares, we buy them forever. And so what we are trying to do when we buy our shares is to buy them at the cheapest price we can purchase them at. I understand there are a lot of companies that repurchase their shares. They do it according to a program, and they know every quarter they're going to -- they've budgeted so and so many dollars to buy in their shares. That's not the way we roll. We -- I will stand firmly behind and I am proud of our repurchase record that goes back to the '70s. We bought shares at attractive prices over that time period and, in that time period, have probably retired in excess of 75% of our then outstanding shares. So yes, it is possible that I'm being a bit stubborn, that the market is going to go up from here, but we've got to do what we think is right for all the shareholders. And our guess, at this point in time, is as it has been, not to spend our corporate cash on share repurchases. That can change at any point in time without any notice to shareholders, but it's how we come out after assessing all the factors that we consider."

Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice",878,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had a great quarter and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results, as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice of speaking in detail on a single topic of interest. Specifically, I'd like to talk a bit about the benefits of diversification with regard to our portfolio of businesses, using the recent histories of CNA and Diamond Offshore as examples. 
It has long been our belief that having a diversified portfolio of businesses subject to different market cycles offers the best way to deliver superior returns over the long term. However, operating in diverse industries does mean that, at any given time, our subsidiaries can face vastly different market environments, some hospitable and others more challenging. CNA and Diamond today illustrate the point. Over the last few years, CNA has been on the upswing while Diamond now operates in an industry facing a protracted down cycle.
Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property/casualty insurance market. Over the last year, CNA's total return to shareholders was more than 70%. While CNA was just as strong financially a year ago as it is today, the market seems to have finally caught on. A little less than 20 years ago, CNA was an insurance company that had lost its way, trying to be all things to all people with no focused strategy. Today, the company has been transformed into a consistently profitable commercial P&C insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. 
Let me give you a little history. Steve Lilienthal, CNA's CEO from 2001 to '09, had the arduous task of streamlining the company. He divested certain lines of business that were not core to CNA, such as reinsurance, life insurance and personal lines. It sounds easier in retrospect, but at the time, it was grueling, and Steve did an excellent job righting the ship. 
When Steve retired in '09, Tom Motamed became the CEO. He focused CNA on improving its market position in specialty and commercial lines, creating a culture of underwriting discipline and making sure that the company had adequate reserves. This new direction helped fortify CNA's balance sheet, which remains rock solid to this day. 
In November of last year, industry veteran Dino Robusto joined CNA, ready, willing, able and chomping-at-the-bit to lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability. CNA's long-standing goal is to post best-in-class underwriting results, and it's getting closer to that achievement every day. CNA's loss ratio is basically in-line with, if not better than, its top-tier competitors. However, its expense ratio tends to be higher than its competition, which management is addressing. 
The bottom line is that while CNA have come a long way, we believe there is still ample runway for value creation, and we believe that Dino, with his energy, experience and vision, is the right individual to get the job done.  If you look at CNA's earnings results for this quarter, you'll see he's already been hard at work. The company had a combined ratio of 93.5%, primarily due to improved underwriting performance.  
In stark contrast to CNA's upswing, Diamond Offshore is operating in an industry that continues to face one of the sharpest downturns in its history. Contracts have been canceled. Leading-edge day rates are oftentimes at or below operating costs, and oil prices remain well below levels of a few years ago. 
Despite the pain, Diamond's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, scale and determination. And while the short- to medium-term outlook for the offshore drilling market remains bleak, Diamond has maintained its relative strength, and all of its newbuild drilling rigs are operating under long-term contracts at an average rate of $450,000 per day. 
The company has also been exploring new ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide better value to its customers. 
While we don't know exactly when the offshore drilling market will recover, we do not doubt the inevitability of a recovery. Steep declines in existing oilfields will hit the market in the next few years, and growth in offshore oil production will be needed to meet demand. Offshore oil is a significant part of the global supply mix that we believe cannot and will not be replaced by conventional offshore drilling or shale production. 
Today, we are seeing the faintest of green shoots as the offshore drilling industry moves towards product standardization and simplification.
So in conclusion, let's remember that it was only about 5 years ago that Diamond was Loews' largest subsidiary by market value, supplying the lion's share of our cash flow. Back then, CNA was just beginning its rise. Yet today, the roles are reversed. Owning companies in a variety of industries offers a safeguard to shareholders against volatility in any one sector. Looking back at our history, we can clearly see that operating in diverse industries has given Loews a distinct advantage in its quest to create long-term value for its shareholders, a commitment that has defined Loews for more than 50 years. 
And now over to David"
285930,530319979,1261886,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2017",2017-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the b",1000,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter.  Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the bulk of the $296 million year-over-year positive earnings win while parent company investment income was the main detractor versus the prior year. 
Lower rig impairments at Diamond contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Rig impairments reduced Loews' net income in Q2 2016 by $267 million, whereas in this year's second quarter, the impairment hit dropped to $23 million. Excluding the Diamond impairments, Loews' net income was $254 million in Q2 2017, up from $202 million in Q2 2016.
The key drivers for the quarter are set forth on Page 12 of our earnings supplement, which has been posted to our Investor Relations website. CNA had an excellent quarter and was, by far, the largest contributor to our consolidated net income at $244 million. This represents a $55 million or 29% year-to-year increase. 
Two factors drove this increase: stronger P&C underwriting income and higher realized investment gains. Net investment income was, in fact, down slightly year-over-year, given a modest falloff in LP results. The improvement in P&C underwriting income came from a meaningfully lower combined ratio. CNA's calendar year combined ratio declined from 97.4% in Q2 2016 to 93.5% in this year's second quarter, a 3.9 point improvement on $1.6 billion of quarterly net earned premiums.
Given that catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development essentially offset one another this quarter, I would highlight the improvement in CNA's combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development, also known as the non-cat accident year combined ratio. Specifically, the company's non-cat accident year combined ratio dropped 3.7 points from 98.3% in Q2 2016 to 94.6% in this year's second quarter. All 3 of CNA's P&C segments, specialty, commercial and international, showed excellent year-over-year improvement. The improvement was particularly notable in the company's commercial and international segments as those non-cat accident year combined ratios dropped by 3.2 points and 14.2 points, respectively.
This quarter highlights CNA's enhanced underwriting discipline, its ongoing favorable prior year development and its focus on expense control. Dino Robusto and his team are singularly focused on continual improvement across CNA, building on the solid foundation created by Tom Motamed during his tenure as CEO. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. While Diamond contributed only $7 million to our net income this quarter, that is over $300 million more than last year's second quarter. The previously mentioned rig impairments accounted for most of the year-over-year swing. That said, even after excluding the impairment charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income increased $57 million year-over-year, driven mainly by higher contract drilling revenues, strong cost controls, reduced depreciation expense owing to last year's rig impairments and a lower effective tax rate.
Boardwalk posted excellent results in the quarter after excluding a onetime loss associated with the sale of a gas processing facility and related gathering assets. The loss decreased Boardwalk's contribution to our net income by $15 million, thus accounting for the year-to-year decline in net income contribution.  Absent this loss, however, Boardwalk would have contributed $21 million to our Q2 2017 net income versus $17 million last year. And remember that in last year's second quarter, Boardwalk benefited from a legal settlement that increased its net income contribution by $4 million.
Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During last year's second quarter, the company wrote down an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. So while the year-over-year net income comparison was still favorable, it's not as dramatic as it first appears. 
The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the write-down and other nonrecurring items, was $61 million for the quarter, up from $56 million in Q2 2016. The increase was principally driven by Loews Hotels joint venture properties at the Universal Orlando Resort. Our earnings supplement includes the definition of adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was weak in Q2 2017 as results from gold-related equities were down meaningfully versus the prior year as were results from other equity strategies. 
While our holdings of gold-related equities can be volatile from one period to another, we have under 3% of parent company cash and investments devoted to this asset class, and over time, these investments have performed as intended within the context of the overall parent company portfolio.
As you know, we closed on the purchase of Consolidated Container Company on May 22. In the segment results on Page 5 of our release, CCC's revenues for the period of our ownership are included in investment income and other. CCC's pretax net income are included in corporate. 
CCC essentially broke-even during the first 6 weeks of our ownership as the company's income was negatively affected by deal-related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting entries. Please note that we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. We expect to show CCC as its own reporting segment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At June 30, post the funding of the CCC acquisition, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, with approximately 2/3 in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. 
During the second quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
CNA announced this morning that it has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, which translates into an incremental $12 million per quarter to Loews. This dividend hike is yet further evidence of CNA's rock-solid capital position and its improving operating performance.

Man, oh man, I lost my pages. There we go. Thank you, David. 
Before we turn the call over to Mary, I want to bring up a question that I think is top of mind for most of you, namely, Why hasn't Loews bought back more shares considering that the sum-of-the-parts discount is the highest it's been in a number of years? As I'm sure you know, we are well aware of Loews' sum-of-the-parts valuation. In fact, it's something that I track constantly. Judging by the increase on our stock price over the past 9 months, it certainly seems that we should have been more active repurchasing our stock. 
What's held us back is that while Loews almost always seems relatively cheap and even more so now, given the widening discount, the market still seems very high to us. We've been nervous about the equity market for a while, and we've been struggling to reconcile our view of the market's absolute level with the relative value of Loews' stock. 
As you know, we take a long-term view on share repurchases. We look for opportunities to repurchase Loews stock when both its relative and absolute values are attractive. We know that if the stock market declines, our share price will likely move in the same direction. So given our nervousness about the stock market, we've been waiting for a time to repurchase shares at a more advantageous price. 
Some of you may think we may be too cautious. You may be right. Only time will tell. Historically, though, we have shown that once we are comfortable buying back shares, we back -- buy back a lot of them. In the last 2 years, our buybacks may have seemed anemic, but over just the last 5 years, we've bought back 14% of our outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Clearly, repurchasing our shares remains an important way that we allocate capital to create shareholder value.

I haven't followed it recently. What we do know is that shale oil production is up rather significantly in the past year, and the general forecast is that U.S. shale oil production can increase by about 1 million barrels per day every year. The question is, for how many years will U.S. shale production be able to increase at that rate? And the other question is, what's going to happen to worldwide oil consumption? And most importantly, in my mind, what's going to happen to worldwide oil depletion? Our guess is that the underinvestment in oil exploration and production over the past 3 years is going to start to take its toll as projects that were completed before that period start to come online and start to deplete. And it's our view that in the coming years, there will be a significant need for the offshore oil that has provided up to 30% of the worldwide oil supply. So I would say that we feel that, right now -- even though you didn't ask about it, we feel that right now we're bouncing along at the bottom with respect to offshore oil drilling. But we believe that there are, as I said, a few green shoots, and we think that in the coming months and years, there'll be more."

That's equipment that's generally third- and fourth-generation rigs where there has been an assessment by the individual owners that those rigs -- it is not worthwhile for them to store those rigs with a hope and expectation that in a number of years, they will be able to come back into the market. There's general agreement that there are more than enough fifth- and six-generation rigs in order to satisfy the future demand for drilling assets over the coming 5 years. So I think that it's very possible that some of that scrapping will continue. But I think the important thing to look at is not the scrapping but rather what percent of the fleet is operating and how much of the fifth- and sixth-generation fleets are stacked and what will be the cost to be able to bring those rigs out of the stack mode when, as and if the demand increases."

I don't think that Loews, in any way, is overpriced versus the stock market. But the stock market trading at 17, 18 or 19x earnings, the fact that interest rates are still as low as they are when we were seeing economic growth of 2.5%, the fact that there's a lot of complacency in all markets, not just the equity markets leads me and I'm pleased to say a significant number of other market commentators to the view that this complacency that we're seeing in the market can lead to a decline in equity values. We -- when most investors buy Loews shares, if they change their mind, if they get nervous about the market, they can turn around and sell those shares. When the company buys in the shares, we buy them forever. And so what we are trying to do when we buy our shares is to buy them at the cheapest price we can purchase them at. I understand there are a lot of companies that repurchase their shares. They do it according to a program, and they know every quarter they're going to -- they've budgeted so and so many dollars to buy in their shares. That's not the way we roll. We -- I will stand firmly behind and I am proud of our repurchase record that goes back to the '70s. We bought shares at attractive prices over that time period and, in that time period, have probably retired in excess of 75% of our then outstanding shares. So yes, it is possible that I'm being a bit stubborn, that the market is going to go up from here, but we've got to do what we think is right for all the shareholders. And our guess, at this point in time, is as it has been, not to spend our corporate cash on share repurchases. That can change at any point in time without any notice to shareholders, but it's how we come out after assessing all the factors that we consider."

This quarter, I'd like to focus primarily on Loews' Hotels and the latest development that are going on there. But before I do, I want to give a brief update on the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey on Loews subsidiaries in Houston and Florida. 
First and foremost, we're counting our blessings that our employees and save and play counted for. But of course, many were severely affected by these catastrophic storms. We're helping to provide support to those employees and their families and happy to report that Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels were minimally impacted from an operations perspective. Our CFO, David Edelson, will share details later in our call about the impact that these storms have had on CNA and its results, but I will be remiss if I didn't highlight how well the company has navigated this challenging catastrophe-filled quarter. CNA posted net operating income of $159 million despite losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the company's capital position actually improved during the quarter. And now on to Loews Hotel.
Over the last 2 years, Loews Hotels has experienced dynamic growth. At the end of 2015, we had 23 hotels with almost 11,500 rooms. Since then, 2 hotels have been sold, and we have opened and/or committed to opening 7 new hotels, which will add about 5,000 keys to our room counts. Even while the chain has been expanding, operating margins have been increasing steadily. Additionally, John Tisch stepped back into his role as CEO of Loews Hotel last fall, just in time to lead this charge. There is no one we trust more at the helm. 
Notwithstanding the company's impressive growth, the hospitality industry is facing increasingly -- an increasingly challenging environment. For almost a decade, the hotel industry has seen consistent top line growth. But in many markets, supply is now outpacing demand and RevPAR growth has decelerated. Social media, instant availability of information, distribution, intermediaries, mobile devices and the sharing economy all exert pressure on the hospitality industry. Simultaneously, hotel companies has consolidated into industry being met with economies of scale pressuring smaller operators. 
So how is Loews Hotels addressing this host of challenges? The company's strategy is twofold. First, we are concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market, operatives that cater to group business and are therefore better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy and the technological disintermediation. These hotels typically have 300 to 800 rooms along with significant meeting space, properties such as the Loews Chicago Hotel, Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville and the Loews Miami Beach Hotel. 
Secondly, Loews Hotels continue to seek out partners who come to the party with properties that have unique built-in demand generators, similar to what we have done so successfully in our long-term partnership with Orlando Resorts, with Universal Orlando Resorts. This strategy of growth in immersive destination leverages our demonstrated success in managing themes concepts, exemplified by one-of-a-kind destinations, such as the Hard Rock Hotel and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort both in Orlando. 
Our partnership with Universal began almost 20 years ago with a joint venture in the first 3 hotels on the theme park campus. Today, Loews Hotels, in partnership with Universal, has 5 hotels and 5,600 rooms in Orlando, and we'll open our 6th property in the summer of 2018, the 600th room Aventura Hotel. And there's more to come. 
In the next several weeks, the partnership plans to announce a project that will be our largest investment so far in Orlando in terms of both rooms and dollars. So stay tuned. Our initial 3 hotel investments in the Orlando joint venture has yielded spectacular return and the properties continue to flourish. The second phase of our expansion in Orlando occurred in 2014 with the opening of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, a 2,200 room hotel that has already recouped much of its initial investment. During 2016, we opened the Loews Sapphire Falls Hotel with 1,000 guest room and connected it to the Loews Royal Pacific to create a combined 2,000 room complex with nearly 250,000 square feet of meeting space. All our properties on the universal campus consistently deliver occupancy rates and room rates well above their competition. Meaning, that our RevPAR there is market-leading.
Universal has been an outstanding partner and our joint ventures have been a great investment for both of us and our expectation is that it will continue to be so. Separating apart from Orlando, over the last several months, we have announced 3 additional new hotel projects that have great promise. The first hotel sits nicely into the part of our core strategy that focuses on group business. It's the 800 key Loews Kansas City hotel. This hotel, which will open in 2020, will be physically connected to the Kansas City Convention Center, which we believe will drive healthy group demand. This property will be the first new major hotel in Kansas City in over 30 years.
The second and third new projects under development fit squarely into our immersive destination strategy. Together with the quarter's companies, Loews' Hotels has announced a new partnership called Live by Loews. The first to 2 properties will be located in Arlington, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri and will open in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These properties are adjacent to the major sports arenas in those cities as well as being located in the quarters company's entertainment districts. 
In St. Louis, we'll partner with the St. Louis Cardinals. And in Arlington, we'll join forces with the Texas Rangers. Both teams have a deep-rooted fan base, and we look forward to welcoming them to our new best-in-class assets. But have no fear, these hotels will do plenty of business on nongame nights to. The stadiums and the quarter's entertainment district will host many concerts and events throughout the year and our hotels will include significant meeting space, making these ideal destinations for groups and transient customers looking for a unique, immersive experience.
These 3 new hotels are all development projects. Why are we focused more on building versus buying? It's simple. First, when you build something, you get exactly what you want. Second, we think the returns are great. We typically look to greenlight projects with midteen cash-on-cash returns on equity. And third, Loews Hotels is both an owner and an operator, a business model that is increasingly rare for hotel companies. This makes us an attractive partner for developers, immersive destination owners and municipalities alike. We think like owners because we are owners, which grades mutually beneficial partnership dynamics for all constituents, something Loews Hotels has prided itself on for almost 60 years that we've been in the business.
We are pleased with the growth and the growth prospects a Loews Hotels. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willing and ability to invest in its projects all represent competitive advantages. Over the coming years, we will continue to leverage our strong, competitive standing in the industry and seek to invest in projects with above market returns as well as cultivating new and existing partnerships. We are confident in Loews Hotels strategy, its leadership and the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson"
285930,540157289,1325431,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter of Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarter",1216,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter of Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly and year-to-date drivers. 2 principal factors cost $170 million year-over-year decline in our third quarter net income. Catastrophe losses at CNA related largely to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria reduced our third quarter net income by $170 million. Last year, the negative impact of catastrophes was only $10 million. 
Additionally, both CNA and Diamond incurred debt redemption charges during the quarter, which combined to reduce our net income by $35 million. Absent CNA's catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charges, our pro forma net income was $362 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter. 
Now for more on CNA. The company had a strong quarter operationally, which isn't obvious from the $178 million year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our third quarter net income. Let me say a bit more about CNA's catastrophe losses and debt redemption charge before highlighting the company's continued underwriting progress. 
CNA is in the insurance business, so catastrophe losses are part for the quarters. The good news is that CNA's losses were very much in line with, if not somewhat below, its market share in the affected areas. We believe this highlights the company's strong risk management. Overall, CNA incurred $269 million pretax of catastrophe losses in the quarter versus only $16 million in Q3 2016. As previously mentioned, these cat losses reduced our net income by $170 million this quarter as compared to $10 million last year. Now for the debt redemption charge. During the quarter, CNA issued $500 million of 10-year notes and redeemed $350 million of notes during November 2019. This early to redemption generated a $42 million pretax charge at CNA, which reduced its contribution to our net income by $24 million. 
Absent the catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charge, CNA's contribution to our net income with have been $324 million, up slightly from the prior year. CNA's underwriting results continued to show real progress in the quarter. It's combined ratio before cat losses and prior year development improved 2.9 points from the prior year from 97.5, down to 94.6. Additionally, the company booked a hefty 7.4 points of favorable prior year development, slightly lower than last year's 8 points, but still extremely positive.
So overall, excluding catastrophes, but including prior year development, CNA's combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2 as compared to 89.4 last year. 
Two more CNA observations. Number one, net investment income was down slightly year-over-year mainly due to slightly lower, but still quite positive LP returns. And number two, realized gains on the investment portfolio were higher last year than this year. Together, these 2 items accounted for a $29 million negative year-to-year net income variance for Loews. Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $6 million to our net income this quarter, about the same as last year. During the third quarter, Diamond issued $500 million of 8-year notes and redeemed $500 million of notes scheduled come due in May 2019. This redemption generated a $35 million pretax charge, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q3 net income by $11 million. Absent this debt redemption charge, Diamond's conjuration to our net income would have been a $17 million, up $10 million from the prior year.
Diamond effective tax rate can differ materially across quarters. So let me comment instead on its pretax income, which was down 9%, excluding the debt redemption charge. Contract drilling revenues were up about 5% from the prior year and depreciation was also favorable because of prior period rig impairments. However, these positives were offset by higher expenses, mainly contract drilling expenses, as well as higher interest expense as some interest is capitalized during last year's third quarter before the Ocean Great White went on contract. As you know, the offshore drilling market remains extremely challenging. Diamond is lay laser focus on maintaining a strong liquidity profile in maximizing its operating cash flow. On to Boardwalk, which posted excellent results in the quarter.
The company's operating revenues, net of fuel and transportation expenses, were up almost 3%. EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 48%. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was $17 million versus $14 million in Q3 2016. This contribution would have been $21 million this quarter if not for estate tax-related deferred tax true-up booked at the Loews level. 
Boardwalk's $1.2 billion of growth projects are on time and on budget and are backed by long-term fixed fee firm contracts. Results on a Loews Hotels improved year-over-year as pretax income rose 132% and adjusted EBITDA was up about 13%. The company's 5 properties at the Universal Orlando Resort propelled these improvements as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was under renovation during last year's third quarter. 
Earnings were negatively affected this year by lagging results at a few other companies group oriented hotels caused mainly by renovation activity and a shift in the holiday schedule. In keeping with Jim's focus on Loews Hotels, we have added information about this business to our quarterly earnings supplement, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted debt. These non-GAAP metrics quantify the prorata EBITDA and mortgage debt attributable to Loews Hotels. 
We disclose these metrics in part because GAAP joint venture accounting makes it difficult for investors to understand the underlying earnings power of Loews Hotels portfolio of joint venture properties. To answer and anticipate a question, we do not plan to begin providing property by property detail. That said, we hope to provide useful color on Loews Hotels results in future quarters.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $48 million, up from $36 million last year and just $2 million last quarter. Equities drove the year-over-year improvement, offset in part by alternatives and gold-related securities. The improvement from last quarter was attributable predominantly to alternatives and equities. And now for our newest subsidiary, consolidated container.
On Page 5 of our earnings release, CCC's revenues are shown in investment income and other and its pretax and net income are included in corporate and other. This is the first full quarter that CCC is included in our results. So it's obviously, still early days. 
Overall, CCC is performing well and the company remains solidly on track to deliver attractive double-digit cash-on-cash returns to Loews. On a net income basis, the company essentially broke even during the quarter. Operationally, CCC experienced some Hurricane Harvey-related disruptions in Q3. CCC's management team continues to impress us with its professionalism, operational know-how and strategic focus. We will have more to say about CCC during our year-end earnings call. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At September 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion with approximately 65% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, Marketable equity securities and our diversified portfolio of limited punishment investments. During the third quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary"

We are managing here for the intermediate to the long term. We are not managing for an individual year. As I constantly say, our goal is to increase long-term value. And so the things that we do not want to do is encourage actions that might lead to spiking earnings in 1-year or the next or doing things that might not lead to long-term value, but instead, might just lead to a short-term problem. So we've constructed a compensation system that focuses on generally consistent earnings for senior executives that compensates them fairly for what they do and generally results in compensation that does not have spikes because of one action or another. By doing that, we have a very collegial group here at the Loews senior management team because everybody knows that there is a -- that this is a team effort to build value. And additionally, because I think in part of the way our compensation system works, there is absolutely no desire on anybody's part to spike earnings in 1-year or the next. And so it's a system that is different than many other systems. We do give 2 senior executives and other Loews employees restricted stock units that hopefully will reflect, hopefully and ultimately, will reflect the value that has been created and provide some incentive, not that it's needed, but provide some incentive to the senior executives to focus on long-term value at Loews."

So it's really a difficult job for someone to value all the hotels. It takes a lot of time, attention and focus. Oftentimes, it means going and visiting properties and just understanding what the potential value might be. It's something that really needs to be done by someone who's well immersed in the hotel business, understands relative value.

And as opposed to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, I think it's going to happen. In fact, more rapidly than market [indiscernible] dollars. We allowed different executives here to have different views. I think what's going to happen -- what's happened is that there has been an anonymous, enormous underinvestment in productive capacity worldwide. It's breathtaking how big that underinvestment has been. And it is my belief, based on study and research, that shale oil produced in the United States will not be able to fully supply worldwide oil demand over the next 5 to 10 years, that there is a limit to the shale productive capacity in the United States. I know that, that statement may be going against history and the trend so far. But I think that what you will see is that there is a limit to how much shale oil can be produced here. Yes, it can increase by 1 million barrels this year and 1 million barrels next year and maybe even 1 million barrels for 1 or 2 years after that. But at some point in time, shale production will level off in the United States. And then what the world will need is more productive capacity. Typically, that productive capacity can take 3 to 5 years to come online and already for the past 2.5 or 3 years, the Board has been seriously under investing in that productive capacity. So my overall view is that oil companies need, major oil companies, we'll be forced by the market to invest in productive capacity. To date, they've had to decide between dividends and capital investing. And they've come down squarely on the side of dividends. But it is my guess that with brent trading over $60 with WTI as $53 or $54 a barrel, this is going to start to accumulate the cash flow that will enable them to crank up some of their offshore exploration and development projects. So while I don't expect a flood of waters this quarter into Diamond Offshore, my guess is that over the coming year or 2, the offshore drilling industry will see a significant increase in inquiring for offshore drilling services."

This quarter, I'd like to focus primarily on Loews' Hotels and the latest developments that are going on there. But before I do, I want to give a brief update on the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey on Loews' subsidiaries in Houston and Florida.
First and foremost, we're counting our blessings that all our employees and save and fully accounted for. But of course, many were still severely affected by these catastrophic storms. We're helping to provide support to those employees and their families and happy to report that Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels were minimally impacted from an operations perspective. Our CFO, David Edelson, will share details later in our call about the impact that these storms have had on CNA and its results, but I would be remiss if I didn't highlight how well the company has navigated this challenging catastrophe-filled quarter. CNA posted net operating income of $159 million despite losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the company's capital position actually improved during the quarter. And now on to Loews Hotel.
Over the last 2 years, Loews Hotels has experienced dynamic growth. At the end of 2015, we had 23 hotels with almost 11,500 rooms. Since then, 2 hotels have been sold, and we have opened and/or committed to opening 7 new hotels, which will add about 5,000 keys to our room count. Even while the chain has been expanding, operating margins have been increasing steadily. Additionally, Jon Tisch stepped back into his role as CEO of Loews Hotel last fall, just in time to lead this charge. There is no one we trust more at the helm.
Notwithstanding the company's impressive growth, the hospitality industry is facing increasingly -- an increasingly challenging environment. For almost a decade, the hotel industry has seen consistent top line growth. But in many markets, supply is now outpacing demand and RevPAR growth has decelerated. Social media, instant availability of information, distribution intermediaries, mobile devices and the sharing economy all exert pressure on the hospitality industry. Simultaneously, hotel companies have consolidated into industry behemoth with economies of scale pressuring smaller operators.
So how is Loews Hotels addressing this host of challenges? The company's strategy is twofold. First, we are concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market, properties that cater to group business and are therefore better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy and technological disintermediation. These hotels typically have 300 to 800 rooms along with significant meeting space, properties such as the Loews Chicago Hotel, Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville and the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.
Secondly, Loews Hotels continues to seek out partners who come to the party with properties that have unique built-in demand generators, similar to what we have done so successfully in our long-term partnership with Orlando Resorts -- with Universal Orlando Resorts. This strategy of growth in immersive destinations leverages our demonstrated success at managing themes concepts, exemplified by our one-of-a-kind destinations such as the Hard Rock Hotel and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, both in Orlando.
Our partnership with Universal began almost 20 years ago with a joint venture in the first 3 hotels on the theme park campus. Today, Loews Hotels, in partnership with Universal, has 5 hotels and 5,600 rooms in Orlando, and we'll open our 6th property in the summer of 2018, the 600-room Aventura Hotel. And there's more to come. 
In the next several weeks, the partnership plans to announce a project that will be our largest investment so far in Orlando in terms of both rooms and dollars. So stay tuned. Our initial 3 hotel investments in the Orlando joint venture has yielded spectacular returns and the properties continue to flourish. The second phase of our expansion in Orlando occurred in 2014 with the opening of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, a 2,200-room hotel that has already recouped much of its initial investment. During 2016, we opened the Loews Sapphire Falls Hotel with 1,000 guest rooms and connected it to the Loews Royal Pacific to create a combined 2,000-room complex with nearly 250,000 square feet of meeting space. All our properties on the Universal campus consistently deliver occupancy rates and room rates well above their competition. Meaning, that our RevPAR there is market-leading.
Universal has been an outstanding partner and our joint ventures have been a great investment for both of us and our expectation is that it will continue to be so. Separating apart from Orlando, over the last several months, we have announced 3 additional new hotel projects that have great promise. The first hotel fits nicely into the part of our core strategy that focuses on group business. It's the 800-key Loews Kansas City Hotel. This hotel, which will open in 2020, will be physically connected to the Kansas City Convention Center, which we believe will drive healthy group demand. This property will be the first new major hotel in Kansas City in over 30 years.
The second and third new projects under development fit squarely into our immersive destination strategy. Together with The Cordish Companies, Loews' Hotels has announced a new partnership called Live! by Loews. The first to 2 such properties will be located in Arlington, Texas, and St. Louis, Missouri and will open in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These properties are adjacent to the major sports arenas in those cities as well as being located in The Cordish Companies' entertainment districts.
In St. Louis, we'll partner with the St. Louis Cardinals. And in Arlington, we'll join forces with the Texas Rangers. Both teams have a deep-rooted fan base, and we look forward to welcoming them to our new best-in-class assets. But have no fear, these hotels will do plenty of business on nongame nights too. The stadiums and the quarter's entertainment district will host many concerts and events throughout the year, and our hotels will include significant meeting space, making these ideal destinations for groups and transient customers looking for a unique, immersive experience.
These 3 new hotels are all development projects. Why have we focused more on building versus buying? It's simple. First, when you build something, you get exactly what you want. Second, we think the returns are great. We typically look to greenlight projects with mid-teen cash-on-cash returns on equity. And third, Loews Hotels is both an owner and an operator, a business model that is increasingly rare for hotel companies. This makes us an attractive partner for developers, immersive destination owners and municipalities alike. We think like owners because we are owners, which creates mutually beneficial partnership dynamics for all constituents, something Loews Hotels has prided itself on for almost 60 years that we've been in the business.
We are pleased with the growth and the growth prospects at Loews Hotels. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willing and ability to invest in its projects all represent competitive advantages. Over the coming years, we will continue to leverage our strong, competitive standing in the industry and seek to invest in projects with above market returns as well as cultivating new and existing partnerships. We're confident in Loews Hotels' strategy, its leadership and the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,540157289,1325507,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter of Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarter",1217,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter of Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly and year-to-date drivers. 2 principal factors caused the $170 million year-over-year decline in our third quarter net income. Catastrophe losses at CNA related largely to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria reduced our third quarter net income by $170 million. Last year, the negative impact of catastrophes was only $10 million. 
Additionally, both CNA and Diamond incurred debt redemption charges during the quarter, which combined to reduce our net income by $35 million. Absent CNA's catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charges, our pro forma net income was $362 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter.
Now for more on CNA. The company had a strong quarter operationally, which isn't obvious from the $178 million year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our third quarter net income. Let me say a bit more about CNA's catastrophe losses and debt redemption charge before highlighting the company's continued underwriting progress.
CNA is in the insurance business, so catastrophe losses are at par for the quarters. The good news is that CNA's losses were very much in line with, if not somewhat below, its market share in the affected areas. We believe this highlights the company's strong risk management. Overall, CNA incurred $269 million pretax of catastrophe losses in the quarter versus only $16 million in Q3 2016. As previously mentioned, these cat losses reduced our net income by $170 million this quarter as compared to $10 million last year. Now for the debt redemption charge. During the quarter, CNA issued $500 million of 10-year notes and redeemed $350 million of notes during November 2019. This early redemption generated a $42 million pretax charge at CNA, which reduced its contribution to our net income by $24 million.
Absent the catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charge, CNA's contribution to our net income would have been $324 million, up slightly from the prior year. CNA's underwriting results continue to show real progress in the quarter. It's combined ratio before cat losses and prior year development improved 2.9 points from the prior year from 97.5%, down to 94.6%. Additionally, the company booked a hefty 7.4 points of favorable prior year development, slightly lower than last year's 8 points, but still extremely positive.
So overall, excluding catastrophes, but including prior year development, CNA's combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2 as compared to 89.4 last year. 
Two more CNA observations. Number one, net investment income was down slightly year-over-year mainly due to slightly lower but still quite positive LP returns. And number two, realized gains on the investment portfolio were higher last year than this year. Together, these 2 items accounted for a $29 million negative year-to-year net income variance for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $6 million to our net income this quarter, about the same as last year. During the third quarter, Diamond issued $500 million of 8-year notes and redeemed $500 million of notes scheduled to come due in May 2019. This redemption generated a $35 million pretax charge, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q3 net income by $11 million. Absent this debt redemption charge, Diamond's conjuration to our net income would have been a $17 million, up $10 million from the prior year.
Diamond's effective tax rate can differ materially across quarters. So let me comment instead on its pretax income, which was down 9%, excluding the debt redemption charge. Contract drilling revenues were up about 5% from the prior year and depreciation was also favorable because of prior period rig impairments. However, these positives were offset by higher expenses, mainly contract drilling expenses, as well as higher interest expense as some interest was capitalized during last year's third quarter before the Ocean GreatWhite went on contract. As you know, the offshore drilling market remains extremely challenging. Diamond is laser focused on maintaining a strong liquidity profile and maximizing its operating cash flow. On to Boardwalk, which posted excellent results in the quarter.
The company's operating revenues, net of fuel and transportation expenses, were up almost 3%. EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 48%.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was $17 million versus $14 million in Q3 2016. This contribution would have been $21 million this quarter if not for estate tax-related deferred tax true-up booked at the Loews level.
Boardwalk's $1.2 billion of growth projects are on time and on budget and are backed by long-term fixed fee firm contracts. Results at Loews Hotels improved year-over-year as pretax income rose 132% and adjusted EBITDA was up about 13%. The company's 5 properties at the Universal Orlando Resort propelled these improvements as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was under renovation during last year's third quarter. 
Earnings were negatively affected this year by lagging results at a few of the company's group oriented hotels caused mainly by renovation activity and a shift in the holiday schedule. In keeping with Jim's focus on Loews Hotels, we have added information about this business to our quarterly earnings supplement, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted debt. These non-GAAP metrics quantify the pro rata EBITDA and mortgage debt attributable to Loews Hotels. 
We disclosed these metrics in part because GAAP joint venture accounting makes it difficult for investors to understand the underlying earnings power of Loews Hotels portfolio of joint venture properties. To answer and anticipate a question, we do not plan to begin providing property by property detail. That said, we hope to provide useful color on Loews Hotels results in future quarters.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $48 million, up from $36 million last year and just $2 million last quarter. Equities drove the year-over-year improvement, offset in part by alternatives and gold-related securities. The improvement from last quarter was attributable predominantly to alternatives and equities. And now for our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container.
On Page 5 of our earnings release, CCC's revenues are shown in investment income and other and its pretax and net income are included in corporate and other. This is the first full quarter that CCC is included in our results so it's obviously still early days.
Overall, CCC is performing well and the company remains solidly on track to deliver attractive double-digit cash-on-cash returns to Loews. On a net income basis, the company essentially broke even during the quarter. Operationally, CCC experienced some Hurricane Harvey-related disruptions in Q3. CCC's management team continues to impress us with its professionalism, operational know-how and strategic focus. We will have more to say about CCC during our year-end earnings call. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At September 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion with approximately 65% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, Marketable equity securities and our diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. During the third quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

We are managing here for the intermediate to the long term. We are not managing for an individual year. As I constantly say, our goal is to increase long-term value. And so the things that we do not want to do is encourage actions that might lead to spiking earnings in 1 year or the next or doing things that might not lead to long-term value, but instead, might just lead to a short-term problem. So we've constructed a compensation system that focuses on generally consistent earnings for senior executives that compensates them fairly for what they do and generally results in compensation that does not have spikes because of one action or another. By doing that, we have a very collegial group here at the Loews senior management team because everybody knows that there is a -- that this is a team effort to build value. And additionally, because I think in part of the way our compensation system works, there is absolutely no desire on anybody's part to spike earnings in 1 year or the next. And so it's a system that is different than many other systems. We do give 2 senior executives and other Loews employees restricted stock units that hopefully will reflect -- hopefully and ultimately, will reflect the value that has been created and provide some incentive, not that it's needed, but provide some incentive to the senior executives to focus on long-term value at Loews."

So it's really a difficult job for someone to value all the hotels. It takes a lot of time, attention and focus. Oftentimes, it means going and visiting properties and just understanding what the potential value might be.

So as I like to say, I'm going to declare victory and retreat. In terms of what has to happen now for there to be increased investment, I think it's going to happen. And as opposed to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, I think it's going to happen. In fact, more rapidly than Marc Edwards does. We allowed different executives here to have different views. I think what's going to happen -- what's happened is that there has been an enormous, enormous underinvestment in productive capacity worldwide. It's breathtaking how big that underinvestment has been. And it is my belief, based on study and research, that shale oil produced in the United States will not be able to fully supply worldwide oil demand over the next 5 to 10 years, that there is a limit to the shale productive capacity in the United States. I know that, that statement may be going against history and the trends so far. But I think that what you will see is that there is a limit to how much shale oil can be produced here. Yes, it can increase by 1 million barrels this year and 1 million barrels next year and maybe even 1 million barrels for 1 or 2 years after that. But at some point in time, shale production will level off in the United States. And then what the world will need is more productive capacity. Typically, that productive capacity can take 3 to 5 years to come online and already for the past 2.5 or 3 years, the world has been seriously under investing in that productive capacity. So my overall view is that oil companies need -- major oil companies will be forced by the market to invest in productive capacity. To date, they've had to decide between dividends and capital investing. And they've come down squarely on the side of dividends. But it is my guess that with Brent trading over $60 and with WTI at $53 or $54 a barrel, this is going to start to accumulate the cash flow that will enable them to crank up some of the offshore exploration and development projects. So while I don't expect a flood of waters this quarter into Diamond Offshore, my guess is that over the coming year or 2, the offshore drilling industry will see a significant increase in inquiring for offshore drilling services."

This quarter, I'd like to focus primarily on Loews' Hotels and the latest developments that are going on there. But before I do, I want to give a brief update on the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey on Loews' subsidiaries in Houston and Florida.
First and foremost, we're counting our blessings that all our employees and save and fully accounted for. But of course, many were still severely affected by these catastrophic storms. We're helping to provide support to those employees and their families and happy to report that Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels were minimally impacted from an operations perspective. Our CFO, David Edelson, will share details later in our call about the impact that these storms have had on CNA and its results, but I would be remiss if I didn't highlight how well the company has navigated this challenging catastrophe-filled quarter. CNA posted net operating income of $159 million despite losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the company's capital position actually improved during the quarter. And now on to Loews Hotel.
Over the last 2 years, Loews Hotels has experienced dynamic growth. At the end of 2015, we had 23 hotels with almost 11,500 rooms. Since then, 2 hotels have been sold, and we have opened and/or committed to opening 7 new hotels, which will add about 5,000 keys to our room count. Even while the chain has been expanding, operating margins have been increasing steadily. Additionally, Jon Tisch stepped back into his role as CEO of Loews Hotel last fall, just in time to lead this charge. There is no one we trust more at the helm.
Notwithstanding the company's impressive growth, the hospitality industry is facing increasingly -- an increasingly challenging environment. For almost a decade, the hotel industry has seen consistent top line growth. But in many markets, supply is now outpacing demand and RevPAR growth has decelerated. Social media, instant availability of information, distribution intermediaries, mobile devices and the sharing economy all exert pressure on the hospitality industry. Simultaneously, hotel companies have consolidated into industry behemoths with economies of scale pressuring smaller operators.
So how is Loews Hotels addressing this host of challenges? The company's strategy is twofold. First, we are concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market, properties that cater to group business and are therefore better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy and technological disintermediation. These hotels typically have 300 to 800 rooms along with significant meeting space, properties such as the Loews Chicago Hotel, Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville and the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.
Secondly, Loews Hotels continues to seek out partners who come to the party with properties that have unique built-in demand generators, similar to what we have done so successfully in our long-term partnership with Orlando Resorts -- with Universal Orlando Resorts. This strategy of growth in immersive destinations leverages our demonstrated success at managing themed concepts, exemplified by our one-of-a-kind destinations such as the Hard Rock Hotel and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, both in Orlando.
Our partnership with Universal began almost 20 years ago with a joint venture in the first 3 hotels on the theme park campus. Today, Loews Hotels, in partnership with Universal, has 5 hotels and 5,600 rooms in Orlando, and we'll open our 6th property in the summer of 2018, the 600-room Aventura Hotel. And there's more to come. 
In the next several weeks, the partnership plans to announce a project that will be our largest investment so far in Orlando in terms of both rooms and dollars. So stay tuned. Our initial 3 hotel investments in the Orlando joint venture has yielded spectacular returns and the properties continue to flourish. The second phase of our expansion in Orlando occurred in 2014 with the opening of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, a 2,200-room hotel that has already recouped much of its initial investment. During 2016, we opened the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort Hotel with 1,000 guest rooms and connected it to the Loews Royal Pacific to create a combined 2,000-room complex with nearly 250,000 square feet of meeting space. All our properties on the Universal campus consistently deliver occupancy rates and room rates well above their competition. Meaning, that our RevPAR there is market-leading.
Universal has been an outstanding partner and our joint ventures have been a great investment for both of us and our expectation is that it will continue to be so. Separate and apart from Orlando, over the last several months, we have announced 3 additional new hotel projects that have great promise. The first hotel fits nicely into the part of our core strategy that focuses on group business. It's the 800-key Loews Kansas City Hotel. This hotel, which will open in 2020, will be physically connected to the Kansas City Convention Center, which we believe will drive healthy group demand. This property will be the first new major hotel in Kansas City in over 30 years.
The second and third new projects under development fit squarely into our immersive destination strategy. Together with The Cordish Companies, Loews Hotels has announced a new partnership called Live! by Loews. The first to 2 such properties will be located in Arlington, Texas, and St. Louis, Missouri and will open in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These properties are adjacent to the major sports arenas in those cities as well as being located in The Cordish Companies' entertainment districts.
In St. Louis, we'll partner with the St. Louis Cardinals. And in Arlington, we'll join forces with the Texas Rangers. Both teams have a deep-rooted fan base, and we look forward to welcoming them to our new best-in-class assets. But have no fear, these hotels will do plenty of business on nongame nights, too. The stadiums and The Cordish entertainment districts will host many concerts and events throughout the year, and our hotels will include significant meeting space, making these ideal destinations for groups and transient customers looking for a unique, immersive experience.
These 3 new hotels are all development projects. Why have we focused more on building versus buying? It's simple. First, when you build something, you get exactly what you want. Second, we think the returns are great. We typically look to greenlight projects with mid-teen cash-on-cash returns on equity. And third, Loews Hotels is both an owner and an operator, a business model that is increasingly rare for hotel companies. This makes us an attractive partner for developers, immersive destination owners and municipalities alike. We think like owners because we are owners, which creates mutually beneficial partnership dynamics for all constituents, something Loews Hotels has prided itself on for almost 60 years that we've been in the business.
We are pleased with the growth and the growth prospects at Loews Hotels. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willing and ability to invest in its projects all represent competitive advantages. Over the coming years, we will continue to leverage our strong, competitive standing in the industry and seek to invest in projects with above market returns as well as cultivating new and existing partnerships. We're confident in Loews Hotels' strategy, its leadership and the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,540157289,1325552,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly",1215,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly and year-to-date drivers. 2 principal factors caused the $170 million year-over-year decline in our third quarter net income. Catastrophe losses at CNA related largely to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria reduced our third quarter net income by $170 million. Last year, the negative impact of catastrophes was only $10 million. 
Additionally, both CNA and Diamond incurred debt redemption charges during the quarter, which combined to reduce our net income by $35 million. Absent CNA's catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charges, our pro forma net income was $362 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter.
Now for more on CNA. The company had a strong quarter operationally, which isn't obvious from the $178 million year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our third quarter net income. Let me say a bit more about CNA's catastrophe losses and debt redemption charge before highlighting the company's continued underwriting progress.
CNA is in the insurance business, so catastrophe losses are par for the course. The good news is that CNA's losses were very much in line with, if not somewhat below, its market share in the affected areas. We believe this highlights the company's strong risk management. Overall, CNA incurred $269 million pretax of catastrophe losses in the quarter versus only $16 million in Q3 2016. As previously mentioned, these cat losses reduced our net income by $170 million this quarter as compared to $10 million last year. Now for the debt redemption charge. During the quarter, CNA issued $500 million of 10-year notes and redeemed $350 million of notes due in November 2019. This early redemption generated a $42 million pretax charge at CNA, which reduced its contribution to our net income by $24 million.
Absent the catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charge, CNA's contribution to our net income would have been $324 million, up slightly from the prior year. CNA's underwriting results continue to show real progress in the quarter. Its combined ratio before cat losses and prior year development improved 2.9 points from the prior year from 97.5%, down to 94.6%. Additionally, the company booked a hefty 7.4 points of favorable prior year development, slightly lower than last year's 8 points, but still extremely positive.
So overall, excluding catastrophes, but including prior year development, CNA's combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2 as compared to 89.4 last year. 
Two more CNA observations. Number one, net investment income was down slightly year-over-year mainly due to slightly lower but still quite positive LP returns. And number two, realized gains on the investment portfolio were higher last year than this year. Together, these 2 items accounted for a $29 million negative year-to-year net income variance for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $6 million to our net income this quarter, about the same as last year. During the third quarter, Diamond issued $500 million of 8-year notes and redeemed $500 million of notes scheduled to come due in May 2019. This redemption generated a $35 million pretax charge, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q3 net income by $11 million. Absent this debt redemption charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income would have been $17 million, up $10 million from the prior year.
Diamond's effective tax rate can differ materially across quarters. So let me comment instead on its pretax income, which was down 9%, excluding the debt redemption charge. Contract drilling revenues were up about 5% from the prior year and depreciation was also favorable because of prior period rig impairments. However, these positives were offset by higher expenses, mainly contract drilling expenses, as well as higher interest expense as some interest was capitalized during last year's third quarter before the Ocean GreatWhite went on contract. As you know, the offshore drilling market remains extremely challenging. Diamond is laser focused on maintaining a strong liquidity profile and maximizing its operating cash flow. On to Boardwalk, which posted excellent results in the quarter.
The company's operating revenues, net of fuel and transportation expenses, were up almost 3%. EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 48%.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was $17 million versus $14 million in Q3 2016. This contribution would have been $21 million this quarter if not for estate tax-related deferred tax true-up booked at the Loews level.
Boardwalk's $1.2 billion of growth projects are on time and on budget and are backed by long-term fixed fee firm contracts. Results at Loews Hotels improved year-over-year as pretax income rose 132% and adjusted EBITDA was up about 13%. The company's 5 properties at the Universal Orlando Resort propelled these improvements as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was under renovation during last year's third quarter. 
Earnings were negatively affected this year by lagging results at a few of the company's group oriented hotels caused mainly by renovation activity and a shift in the holiday schedule. In keeping with Jim's focus on Loews Hotels, we have added information about this business to our quarterly earnings supplement, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted debt. These non-GAAP metrics quantify the pro rata EBITDA and mortgage debt attributable to Loews Hotels. 
We disclosed these metrics in part because GAAP joint venture accounting makes it difficult for investors to understand the underlying earnings power of Loews Hotels' portfolio of joint venture properties. To answer and anticipate a question, we do not plan to begin providing property by property detail. That said, we hope to provide useful color on Loews Hotels results in future quarters.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $48 million, up from $36 million last year and just $2 million last quarter. Equities drove the year-over-year improvement, offset in part by alternatives and gold-related securities. The improvement from last quarter was attributable predominantly to alternatives and equities. And now for our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container.
On Page 5 of our earnings release, CCC's revenues are shown in investment income and other and its pretax and net income are included in corporate and other. This is the first full quarter that CCC is included in our results so it's obviously still early days.
Overall, CCC is performing well and the company remains solidly on track to deliver attractive double-digit cash-on-cash returns to Loews. On a net income basis, the company essentially broke even during the quarter. Operationally, CCC experienced some Hurricane Harvey-related disruptions in Q3. CCC's management team continues to impress us with its professionalism, operational know-how and strategic focus. We will have more to say about CCC during our year-end earnings call. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At September 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion with approximately 65% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. During the third quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

We are managing here for the intermediate to the long term. We are not managing for an individual year. As I constantly say, our goal is to increase long-term value. And so the things that we do not want to do is encourage actions that might lead to spiking earnings in 1 year or the next or doing things that might not lead to long-term value, but instead, might just lead to a short-term problem. So we've constructed a compensation system that focuses on generally consistent earnings for senior executives that compensates them fairly for what they do and generally results in compensation that does not have spikes because of one action or another. By doing that, we have a very collegial group here at the Loews senior management team because everybody knows that there is a -- that this is a team effort to build value. And additionally, because I think in part of the way our compensation system works, there is absolutely no desire on anybody's part to spike earnings in 1 year or the next. And so it's a system that is different than many other systems. We do give 2 senior executives and other Loews employees restricted stock units that hopefully will reflect -- hopefully and ultimately, will reflect the value that has been created and provide some incentive, not that it's needed, but provide some incentive to the senior executives to focus on long-term value at Loews."

There are other hotels that, for one reason or another, might not be earning in 1 year or multiple years significant EBITDA, but that can nonetheless be worth a lot of money. So it's really a difficult job for someone to value all the hotels. It takes a lot of time, attention and focus. Oftentimes, it means going and visiting properties and just understanding what the potential value might be. It's something that really needs to be done by someone who's well immersed in the hotel business, who understands relative values. They should be able to come up with a pretty accurate number of what each of the individual hotels might be worth."

So as I like to say, I'm going to declare victory and retreat. In terms of what has to happen now for there to be increased investment, I think it's going to happen. And as opposed to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, I think it's going to happen, in fact, more rapidly than Marc Edwards does. We allow different executives here to have different views. I think what's going to happen -- what's happened is that there has been an enormous, enormous underinvestment in productive capacity worldwide. It's breathtaking how big that underinvestment has been. And it is my belief, based on study and research, that shale oil produced in the United States will not be able to fully supply worldwide oil demand over the next 5 to 10 years, that there is a limit to the shale productive capacity in the United States. I know that, that statement may be going against history and the trends so far. But I think that what you will see is that there is a limit to how much shale oil can be produced here. Yes, it can increase by 1 million barrels this year and 1 million barrels next year and maybe even 1 million barrels for 1 or 2 years after that. But at some point in time, shale production will level off in the United States. And then what the world will need is more productive capacity. Typically, that productive capacity can take 3 to 5 years to come online and already for the past 2.5 or 3 years, the world has been seriously under investing in that productive capacity. So my overall view is that oil companies need -- major oil companies will be forced by the market to invest in productive capacity. To date, they've had to decide between dividends and capital investing. And they've come down squarely on the side of dividends. But it is my guess that with Brent trading over $60 and with WTI at $53 or $54 a barrel, this is going to start to accumulate the cash flow that will enable them to crank up some of their offshore exploration and development projects. So while I don't expect a flood of orders this quarter into Diamond Offshore, my guess is that over the coming year or 2, the offshore drilling industry will see a significant increase in inquiring for offshore drilling services."

This quarter, I'd like to focus primarily on Loews' Hotels and the latest developments that are going on there. But before I do, I want to give a brief update on the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey on Loews' subsidiaries in Houston and Florida.
First and foremost, we're counting our blessings that all our employees and save and fully accounted for. But of course, many were still severely affected by these catastrophic storms. We're helping to provide support to those employees and their families and happy to report that Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels were minimally impacted from an operations perspective. Our CFO, David Edelson, will share details later in our call about the impact that these storms have had on CNA and its results, but I would be remiss if I didn't highlight how well the company has navigated this challenging catastrophe-filled quarter. CNA posted net operating income of $159 million despite losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the company's capital position actually improved during the quarter. And now on to Loews Hotel.
Over the last 2 years, Loews Hotels has experienced dynamic growth. At the end of 2015, we had 23 hotels with almost 11,500 rooms. Since then, 2 hotels have been sold, and we have opened and/or committed to opening 7 new hotels, which will add about 5,000 keys to our room count. Even while the chain has been expanding, operating margins have been increasing steadily. Additionally, Jon Tisch stepped back into his role as CEO of Loews Hotel last fall, just in time to lead this charge. There is no one we trust more at the helm.
Notwithstanding the company's impressive growth, the hospitality industry is facing increasingly -- an increasingly challenging environment. For almost a decade, the hotel industry has seen consistent top line growth. But in many markets, supply is now outpacing demand and RevPAR growth has decelerated. Social media, instant availability of information, distribution intermediaries, mobile devices and the sharing economy all exert pressure on the hospitality industry. Simultaneously, hotel companies have consolidated into industry behemoths with economies of scale pressuring smaller operators.
So how is Loews Hotels addressing this host of challenges? The company's strategy is twofold. First, we are concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market, properties that cater to group business and are therefore better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy and technological disintermediation. These hotels typically have 300 to 800 rooms along with significant meeting space, properties such as the Loews Chicago Hotel, Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville and the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.
Secondly, Loews Hotels continues to seek out partners who come to the party with properties that have unique built-in demand generators, similar to what we have done so successfully in our long-term partnership with Orlando Resorts -- with Universal Orlando Resorts. This strategy of growth in immersive destinations leverages our demonstrated success at managing themed concepts, exemplified by our one-of-a-kind destinations such as the Hard Rock Hotel and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, both in Orlando.
Our partnership with Universal began almost 20 years ago with a joint venture in the first 3 hotels on the theme park campus. Today, Loews Hotels, in partnership with Universal, has 5 hotels and 5,600 rooms in Orlando, and we'll open our 6th property in the summer of 2018, the 600-room Aventura Hotel. And there's more to come. 
In the next several weeks, the partnership plans to announce a project that will be our largest investment so far in Orlando in terms of both rooms and dollars. So stay tuned. Our initial 3 hotel investments in the Orlando joint venture has yielded spectacular returns and the properties continue to flourish. The second phase of our expansion in Orlando occurred in 2014 with the opening of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, a 2,200-room hotel that has already recouped much of its initial investment. During 2016, we opened the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort Hotel with 1,000 guest rooms and connected it to the Loews Royal Pacific to create a combined 2,000-room complex with nearly 250,000 square feet of meeting space. All our properties on the Universal campus consistently deliver occupancy rates and room rates well above their competition. Meaning, that our RevPAR there is market-leading.
Universal has been an outstanding partner and our joint ventures have been a great investment for both of us and our expectation is that it will continue to be so. Separate and apart from Orlando, over the last several months, we have announced 3 additional new hotel projects that have great promise. The first hotel fits nicely into the part of our core strategy that focuses on group business. It's the 800-key Loews Kansas City Hotel. This hotel, which will open in 2020, will be physically connected to the Kansas City Convention Center, which we believe will drive healthy group demand. This property will be the first new major hotel in Kansas City in over 30 years.
The second and third new projects under development fit squarely into our immersive destination strategy. Together with The Cordish Companies, Loews Hotels has announced a new partnership called Live! by Loews. The first to 2 such properties will be located in Arlington, Texas, and St. Louis, Missouri and will open in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These properties are adjacent to the major sports arenas in those cities as well as being located in The Cordish Companies' entertainment districts.
In St. Louis, we'll partner with the St. Louis Cardinals. And in Arlington, we'll join forces with the Texas Rangers. Both teams have a deep-rooted fan base, and we look forward to welcoming them to our new best-in-class assets. But have no fear, these hotels will do plenty of business on nongame nights, too. The stadiums and The Cordish entertainment districts will host many concerts and events throughout the year, and our hotels will include significant meeting space, making these ideal destinations for groups and transient customers looking for a unique, immersive experience.
These 3 new hotels are all development projects. Why have we focused more on building versus buying? It's simple. First, when you build something, you get exactly what you want. Second, we think the returns are great. We typically look to greenlight projects with mid-teen cash-on-cash returns on equity. And third, Loews Hotels is both an owner and an operator, a business model that is increasingly rare for hotel companies. This makes us an attractive partner for developers, immersive destination owners and municipalities alike. We think like owners because we are owners, which creates mutually beneficial partnership dynamics for all constituents, something Loews Hotels has prided itself on for almost 60 years that we've been in the business.
We are pleased with the growth and the growth prospects at Loews Hotels. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willing and ability to invest in its projects all represent competitive advantages. Over the coming years, we will continue to leverage our strong, competitive standing in the industry and seek to invest in projects with above market returns as well as cultivating new and existing partnerships. We're confident in Loews Hotels' strategy, its leadership and the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,540157289,1327282,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly",1213,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews, reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly and year-to-date drivers. 2 principal factors caused the $170 million year-over-year decline in our third quarter net income. Catastrophe losses at CNA related largely to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria reduced our third quarter net income by $170 million. Last year, the negative impact of catastrophes was only $10 million. 
Additionally, both CNA and Diamond incurred debt redemption charges during the quarter, which combined to reduce our net income by $35 million. Absent CNA's catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charges, our pro forma net income was $362 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter.
Now for more on CNA. The company had a strong quarter operationally, which isn't obvious from the $178 million year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our third quarter net income. Let me say a bit more about CNA's catastrophe losses and debt redemption charge before highlighting the company's continued underwriting progress.
CNA is in the insurance business, so catastrophe losses are par for the course. The good news is that CNA's losses were very much in line with, if not somewhat below, its market share in the affected areas. We believe this highlights the company's strong risk management. Overall, CNA incurred $269 million pretax of catastrophe losses in the quarter versus only $16 million in Q3 2016. As previously mentioned, these cat losses reduced our net income by $170 million this quarter as compared to $10 million last year. Now for the debt redemption charge. During the quarter, CNA issued $500 million of 10-year notes and redeemed $350 million of notes due in November 2019. This early redemption generated a $42 million pretax charge at CNA, which reduced its contribution to our net income by $24 million.
Absent the catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charge, CNA's contribution to our net income would have been $324 million, up slightly from the prior year. CNA's underwriting results continue to show real progress in the quarter. Its combined ratio before cat losses and prior year development improved 2.9 points from the prior year from 97.5%, down to 94.6%. Additionally, the company booked a hefty 7.4 points of favorable prior year development, slightly lower than last year's 8 points, but still extremely positive.
So overall, excluding catastrophes, but including prior year development, CNA's combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2 as compared to 89.4 last year. 
Two more CNA observations. Number one, net investment income was down slightly year-over-year mainly due to slightly lower but still quite positive LP returns. And number two, realized gains on the investment portfolio were higher last year than this year. Together, these 2 items accounted for a $29 million negative year-to-year net income variance for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $6 million to our net income this quarter, about the same as last year. During the third quarter, Diamond issued $500 million of 8-year notes and redeemed $500 million of notes scheduled to come due in May 2019. This redemption generated a $35 million pretax charge, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q3 net income by $11 million. Absent this debt redemption charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income would have been $17 million, up $10 million from the prior year.
Diamond's effective tax rate can differ materially across quarters. So let me comment instead on its pretax income, which was down 9%, excluding the debt redemption charge. Contract drilling revenues were up about 5% from the prior year and depreciation was also favorable because of prior period rig impairments. However, these positives were offset by higher expenses, mainly contract drilling expenses, as well as higher interest expense as some interest was capitalized during last year's third quarter before the Ocean GreatWhite went on contract. As you know, the offshore drilling market remains extremely challenging. Diamond is laser focused on maintaining a strong liquidity profile and maximizing its operating cash flow. On to Boardwalk, which posted excellent results in the quarter.
The company's operating revenues, net of fuel and transportation expenses, were up almost 3%. EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 48%.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was $17 million versus $14 million in Q3 2016. This contribution would have been $21 million this quarter if not for estate tax-related deferred tax true-up booked at the Loews level.
Boardwalk's $1.2 billion of growth projects are on time and on budget and are backed by long-term fixed-fee firm contracts. Results at Loews Hotels improved year-over-year as pretax income rose 132% and adjusted EBITDA was up about 13%. The company's 5 properties at the Universal Orlando Resort propelled these improvements as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was under renovation during last year's third quarter. 
Earnings were negatively affected this year by lagging results at a few of the company's group-oriented hotels caused mainly by renovation activity and a shift in the holiday schedule. In keeping with Jim's focus on Loews Hotels, we have added information about this business to our quarterly earnings supplement, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted debt. These non-GAAP metrics quantify the pro rata EBITDA and mortgage debt attributable to Loews Hotels. 
We disclosed these metrics in part because GAAP joint venture accounting makes it difficult for investors to understand the underlying earnings power of Loews Hotels' portfolio of joint venture properties. To answer and anticipate a question, we do not plan to begin providing property by property detail. That said, we hope to provide useful color on Loews Hotels results in future quarters.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $48 million, up from $36 million last year and just $2 million last quarter. Equities drove the year-over-year improvement, offset in part by alternatives and gold-related securities. The improvement from last quarter was attributable predominantly to alternatives and equities. And now for our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container.
On Page 5 of our earnings release, CCC's revenues are shown in investment income and other and its pretax and net income are included in corporate and other. This is the first full quarter that CCC is included in our results so it's obviously still early days.
Overall, CCC is performing well and the company remains solidly on track to deliver attractive double-digit cash-on-cash returns to Loews. On a net income basis, the company essentially broke even during the quarter. Operationally, CCC experienced some Hurricane Harvey-related disruptions in Q3. CCC's management team continues to impress us with its professionalism, operational know-how and strategic focus. We will have more to say about CCC during our year-end earnings call. 
Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At September 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion with approximately 65% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. During the third quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

And so the things that we do not want to do is encourage actions that might lead to spiking earnings in 1 year or the next or doing things that might not lead to long-term value, but instead, might just lead to a short-term problem. So we've constructed a compensation system that focuses on generally consistent earnings for senior executives that compensates them fairly for what they do and generally results in compensation that does not have spikes because of one action or another. By doing that, we have a very collegial group here at the Loews senior management team because everybody knows that there is a -- that this is a team effort to build value. And additionally, because I think in part of the way our compensation system works, there is absolutely no desire on anybody's part to spike earnings in 1 year or the next. And so it's a system that is different than many other systems. We do give 2 senior executives and other Loews employees restricted stock units that hopefully will reflect -- hopefully and ultimately, will reflect the value that has been created and provide some incentive, not that it's needed, but provide some incentive to the senior executives to focus on long-term value at Loews."

You've got -- for some hotels, it's fine to look at EBITDA -- for a lot of them it is, but you have to understand the marketplace in which they're operating. There are other hotels that, for one reason or another, might not be earning in 1 year or multiple years significant EBITDA, but that can nonetheless be worth a lot of money. So it's really a difficult job for someone to value all the hotels. It takes a lot of time, attention and focus. Oftentimes, it means going and visiting properties and just understanding what the potential value might be. It's something that really needs to be done by someone who's well immersed in the hotel business, who understands relative values. They should be able to come up with a pretty accurate number of what each of the individual hotels might be worth."

So as I like to say, I'm going to declare victory and retreat. In terms of what has to happen now for there to be increased investment, I think it's going to happen. And as opposed to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, I think it's going to happen, in fact, more rapidly than Marc Edwards does. We allow different executives here to have different views. I think what's going to happen -- what's happened is that there has been an enormous, enormous underinvestment in productive capacity worldwide. It's breathtaking how big that underinvestment has been. And it is my belief, based on study and research, that shale oil produced in the United States will not be able to fully supply worldwide oil demand over the next 5 to 10 years, that there is a limit to the shale productive capacity in the United States. I know that, that statement may be going against history and the trends so far. But I think that what you will see is that there is a limit to how much shale oil can be produced here. Yes, it can increase by 1 million barrels this year and 1 million barrels next year and maybe even 1 million barrels for 1 or 2 years after that. But at some point in time, shale production will level off in the United States. And then what the world will need is more productive capacity. Typically, that productive capacity can take 3 to 5 years to come online and already for the past 2.5 or 3 years, the world has been seriously under-investing in that productive capacity. So my overall view is that oil companies need -- major oil companies will be forced by the market to invest in productive capacity. To date, they've had to decide between dividends and capital investing. And they've come down squarely on the side of dividends. But it is my guess that with Brent trading over $60 and with WTI at $53 or $54 a barrel, this is going to start to accumulate the cash flow that will enable them to crank up some of their offshore exploration and development projects. So while I don't expect a flood of orders this quarter into Diamond Offshore, my guess is that over the coming year or 2, the offshore drilling industry will see a significant increase in inquiring for offshore drilling services."
