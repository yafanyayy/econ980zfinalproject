267105,415851984,1121121,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a",1180,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a result, operating earnings finished at $3.80 per share for the full year 2016, which was 10.5% above operating earnings for 2015. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments and our financial results for 2016.
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.44 per share for 2016. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter and the full year were charges associated with coal ash remediation at several of our closed coal-generating plants. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million, 94% higher than the level produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 63% to $37.7 million. 
On December 1, Dominion Midstream Partners completed the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion Resources. The acquisition more than doubled Dominion Midstream's ongoing adjusted EBITDA and is expected to cover our planned 22% distribution growth through mid- to late 2018. 
Finally, on January 25, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2605 per unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our distribution growth plans. 
Moving to treasury activities and earnings guidance at Dominion. 2016 marked the peak in our capital growth plan, with over $5 billion [ph] in growth CapEx and $4.4 billion acquisition of Questar.  During the year, we raised over $10 billion [ph] in capital to fund growth, make acquisitions and repay maturing debt. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.1 billion for 2016. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.4 billion. 
For our planned public debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
As we move into 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County power station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the anticipated asset trough [ph] into Dominion Midstream Partners in 2018, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically beginning next year, moving from negative to significantly positive. 
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash flow as Cove Point is troughed [ph] in Dominion Midstream Partners, which we'll use to reduce debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 85% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and 100% of first quarter productions. We also expect to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in the Northeast. 
Before we move to earnings guidance, let me comment briefly about anticipated federal tax law changes. Our preliminary analysis shows a wide range of potential outcomes depending on what decisions are made around the actual tax rate, interest deductibility, day 1 [ph] expensing and normalization. We have highlighted some of the key issues on Slide 8. 
Remember, different than many of our peers, we have a portfolio of nonregulated and long-term contracted cash flows that will be treated differently than our regulated portfolio. Based on our asset mix and public information to date, we would expect to be somewhat earnings-neutral to any final tax package. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. It has been evident for some time that 2017 will be a challenging year for Dominion to achieve its historical earnings growth rate. Now that we have hedged most of Millstone's 2017 expected output, we estimate a $10 to $12 per megawatt hour reduction in realized energy prices versus last year, impacting 2017 earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share. 
Also, as we have said on previous calls, we expect to generate about $0.30 per share in solar investment tax credits, a year-over-year reduction of almost $0.20 per share. As a result, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for 2017 is $3.40 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.15 per share or about 4% below operating earnings of $3.80 per share for 2016. Operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $0.90 to $1.10 per share. 
Moving to 2018, we believe operating earnings will increase by at least 10% over 2017. Cove Point export should provide between $0.40 and $0.45 per share of incremental earnings in 2018. Having one pure refueling [ph] outage at Millstone should add another $0.10 per share to year-over-year results. Offsetting these growth drivers will be an expected further reduction in solar investment tax credits of $0.15 to $0.20 per share from 2017. We expect about $0.10 per share contributions from solar ITCs in 2018 and beyond, driven by customer needs in Virginia. While we are not providing a specific guidance range for 2018 today, you can see that these factors alone can support at least a 10% increase in year-over-year operating earnings. 
Looking to 2019 and beyond, we believe our growth opportunities can [ph] continue to be one of the best in the energy industry. Some of the growth drivers to focus on are highlighted on Slide 11.  All of our business segments are well positioned to support strong growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to these organic growth drivers, Dominion will benefit through the use of about [ph] $7 billion in cash flow generated by asset contributions to our MLP. A portion of this cash flow will significantly reduce parent level debt and allow for share repurchases, as well as support our growth capital needs. 
With the growth we have highlighted, we expect 6% to 8% compounded average growth rate and earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry. 
So let me summarize my financial review. 
2016 operating earnings of $3.80 per share. 2017 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.90 per share. 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. 2017 through 2020, earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%. And we anticipate dividend growth of more than 8% per year beginning in 2018. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year.  I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the year, the highest since 2013 and the second highest since Millstone joined the fleet 16 years ago. Surry Unit 1 set a fleet record for the shortest refueling outage this fall, suppressing [ph] a record set at North Anna in 2015. 
Our Brunswick County power station, which began operating last April, has been honored with a number of industry awards, including Best Overall Generation Project of the Year and Excellence in Safety Best Project. [ph] 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of year-end 2016, the $1.3 billion project was 19% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
5 solar projects were completed in the fourth quarter. The 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern shore [ph] went into service in October. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts went into service in December, along with a 60-megawatt solar facility in North Carolina.  For the full year 2016, 727 megawatts were added to our solar portfolio. 
We have a number of solar projects under development in the State of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. 
In November, we announced a major expansion of our solar alliance with Amazon Web Services [ph] to add 180 megawatts of new solar-generated capacity at sites in 5 Virginia counties, all of which are being serviced this year. In total, we have announced close to 300 megawatts that will go into service by year-end, bringing our operating portfolio to over 1,400 megawatts of solar-generated capacity. 
We have been working to secure a combined operating license for a third unit at our North Anna nuclear power station since 2009. Last month, the staff of Nuclear Regulatory Commission [ph] completed its final safety evaluation report, concluding that there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a license for construction and operation of the proposed reactor. Following a mandatory hearing later this year, the commission will vote on whether to authorize the staff to issue the license. 
Company has made no decision to construct North Anna 3, [ph] but with the combined operating license, we'll preserve its option to do so should the Virginia State Corporation Commission [ph] believe it is in the best interest of our customers. The company has included new nuclear [ph] in its integrated resource plan as one option to meet future customer demand and comply with environmental regulations. 
Dominion Virginia Power connected 11 new data centers in 2016, 2 more than planned and 2 more than in 2015. We anticipate a similar number of centers to come online this year and each year through the end of the decade. In fact, we have already connected 1 new data center already this year. 
In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approvals and construction. $784 million worth of these facilities were completed last year, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year. 
Our strategic undergrounding program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. In August of 2016, State Corporation Commission approved Phase 1 and the recovery of $139 million capital investment to convert 412 miles of overhead cap lines to underground. We will invest $110 million in capital and convert an additional 244 miles of overhead cap lines during Phase 2. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 84% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially done. All major equipment has been set, and steel and pipe installation continues. 
We completed pressure testing of the air cooled condenser, and commissioning is underway for electrical, compressed air and water treatment. We expect to achieve completion of 95% or more of structural steel by the end of this quarter. The project continues on time and on budget to be in service later this year. 
We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft of our Environmental Impact Statement in December, in line with their permitting schedule. The report is favorable, and importantly, concluded that environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. 
ACP has essentially completed its design, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. The project budget has been updated for the construction plan, including the cost to reroute segments impacting U.S. 4 [ph] service lands, [ph] and we now anticipate total development cost to the project, excluding financing cost, of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. ACP expects to maintain the returns on the project through a combination of construction contingencies and negotiated rate adjustments, as allowed by the existing customer agreements. 
We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019. 
A record 6 major pipeline expansion projects were placed into service in 2016, adding 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity for our customers. We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway, with $700 million of investment to move 900 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. 
We're seeing continued appetite for new pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a more open federal policy for infrastructure investments will increase drilling in the basin and increase demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will, in turn, accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. 
Based on these drivers, we expect to secure a number of new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2016. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we look forward to completion of these major projects, which will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year. 
As Mark stated, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive drivers will support continued growth in years to come, supporting an earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2020, off of our 2017 base year. 
Finally, because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

But the key drivers for us -- and remember, our mix is different than a lot of truly regulated companies, but the tax rate obviously is a key component on where that lands. Interest deductibility is a very large component for us because of our unregulated fleet and the amount of [ph] current interest that we deduct. Normalization, practices and our regulated operations, we operate in many, many states and day 1 expense -- so taken each one individually, they could have a positive or slightly negative impact, some greater than others.

No, it's not really the ACP delay, although, obviously, ACP versus previous estimates will be lower in '19 as the build-out occurs and be stronger, or I guess, equivalent, I should say, in '20. But there's a couple of things to think about there. And when I referenced to Greg earlier that we've kind of reset the commodity deck [ph] here, that is a reference to really 2 parts of our business. Obviously, the power piece of it, which everybody -- there's real clarity on that. But the second is gas and oil prices that might impact our business, in particular at Blue Racer. Blue Racer's contribution versus previous estimates are going to be down significantly based on current oil and gas outlook. That can change. It could go up. But we wanted to normalize that in this growth rate. Also, the contributions at Hastings, [ph] a small processing plant that is housed within DTI, their contributions are also down from previous expectations based on the same liquids pricing events that are out there. So again, instead of taking a very bullish recovery in commodities, we've pretty much looked at the strip. And if your outlook is that, that is conservative based on a recovering economy in E&P [ph] and to others, [ph] then that could well happen. But those are the 2 biggest drivers in the '19 and '20 timeframe than what we would've talked about previously."

It's quite positive as I mentioned earlier, and it's obviously there for anybody to see. It had about 85 potential conditions in it, number like that, which I think is purer than we had at Cove Point actually or much longer pipeline. So we were FERC had done a very thorough analysis, but we had done a lot of very thorough work before filing everything that any major reroutes were already all scoped out before the draft Environmental Impact Statement came out. Environment period is underway public hearings will be heard starting at the end of this month that will all be wrapped up in early March. So we don't see any hurdles to getting our final EIS out in June as its scheduled. There's an issue I know people may have with going down to 2 FERC Commissioners here, I guess, in about a week or few days. We don't need to have a full complement for a FERC until summertime to be on our schedule. So I'm highly confident that the President will appoint folks by then, they'll be confirmed by the Senate and seated. So we think it's going extremely well, we signed our construction contract also get into account all the changes that were necessary as a part of the rerouting through the mountains and the forests the national forests. So all in all, ACP is going extremely well."

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a",1171,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a result, operating earnings finished at $3.80 per share for the full year 2016, which was 10.5% above operating earnings for 2015. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments and our financial results for 2016.
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.44 per share for 2016. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter and the full year were charges associated with coal ash remediation at several of our closed coal-generating plants. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million, 94% higher than the level produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 63% to $37.7 million. 
On December 1, Dominion Midstream Partners completed the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion Resources. The acquisition more than doubled Dominion Midstream's ongoing adjusted EBITDA and is expected to cover our planned 22% distribution growth through mid- to late 2018. 
Finally, on January 25, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2605 per unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our distribution growth plans. 
Moving to treasury activities and earnings guidance at Dominion. 2016 marked the peak in our capital growth plan, with over $5 billion in growth CapEx and $4.4 billion acquisition of Questar.  During the year, we raised over $10 billion in capital to fund growth, make acquisitions and repay maturing debt. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.1 billion for 2016. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.4 billion. 
For our planned public debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
As we move into 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the anticipated asset drop into Dominion Midstream Partners in 2018, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically beginning next year, moving from negative to significantly positive. 
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash flow as Cove Point is dropped in Dominion Midstream Partners, which we'll use to reduce debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 85% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and 100% of first quarter productions. We also expect to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in the Northeast. 
Before we move to earnings guidance, let me comment briefly about anticipated federal tax law changes. Our preliminary analysis shows a wide range of potential outcomes depending on what decisions are made around the actual tax rate, interest deductibility, day 1 expensing and normalization. We have highlighted some of the key issues on Slide 8. 
Remember, different than many of our peers, we have a portfolio of nonregulated and long-term contracted cash flows that will be treated differently than our regulated portfolio. Based on our asset mix and public information to date, we would expect to be somewhat earnings-neutral to any final tax package. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. It has been evident for some time that 2017 will be a challenging year for Dominion to achieve its historical earnings growth rate. Now that we have hedged most of Millstone's 2017 expected output, we estimate a $10 to $12 per megawatt hour reduction in realized energy prices versus last year, impacting 2017 earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share. 
Also, as we have said on previous calls, we expect to generate about $0.30 per share in solar investment tax credits, a year-over-year reduction of almost $0.20 per share. As a result, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for 2017 is $3.40 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.15 per share or about 4% below operating earnings of $3.80 per share for 2016. Operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $0.90 to $1.10 per share. 
Moving to 2018, we believe operating earnings will increase by at least 10% over 2017. Cove Point export should provide between $0.40 and $0.45 per share of incremental earnings in 2018. Having one fewer refueling outage at Millstone should add another $0.10 per share to year-over-year results. Offsetting these growth drivers will be an expected further reduction in solar investment tax credits of $0.15 to $0.20 per share from 2017. We expect about $0.10 per share contributions from solar ITCs in 2018 and beyond, driven by customer needs in Virginia. While we are not providing a specific guidance range for 2018 today, you can see that these factors alone can support at least a 10% increase in year-over-year operating earnings. 
Looking to 2019 and beyond, we believe our growth opportunities continue to be one of the best in the energy industry. Some of the growth drivers to focus on are highlighted on Slide 11.  All of our business segments are well positioned to support strong growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to these organic growth drivers, Dominion will benefit through the use of about $7 billion in cash flow generated by asset contributions to our MLP. A portion of this cash flow will significantly reduce parent level debt and allow for share repurchases, as well as support our growth capital needs. 
With the growth we have highlighted, we expect 6% to 8% compounded average growth rate and earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry. 
So let me summarize my financial review. 
2016 operating earnings of $3.80 per share. 2017 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.90 per share. 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. 2017 through 2020, earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%. And we anticipate dividend growth of more than 8% per year beginning in 2018. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year.  I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the year, the highest since 2013 and the second highest since Millstone joined the fleet 16 years ago. Surry Unit 1 set a fleet record for the shortest refueling outage this fall, suppressing a record set at North Anna in 2015. 
Our Brunswick County Power Station, which began operating last April, has been honored with a number of industry awards, including Best Overall Generation Project of the Year and Excellence in Safety Best Project. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of year-end 2016, the $1.3 billion project was 19% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
5 solar projects were completed in the fourth quarter. The 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern shore went into service in October. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts went into service in December, along with a 60-megawatt solar facility in North Carolina.  For the full year 2016, 727 megawatts were added to our solar portfolio. 
We have a number of solar projects under development in the State of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. 
In November, we announced a major expansion of our solar alliance with Amazon Web Services to add 180 megawatts of new solar-generated capacity at sites in 5 Virginia counties, all of which are being serviced this year. In total, we have announced close to 300 megawatts that will go into service by year-end, bringing our operating portfolio to over 1,400 megawatts of solar-generated capacity. 
We have been working to secure a combined operating license for a third unit at our North Anna nuclear power station since 2009. Last month, the staff of Nuclear Regulatory Commission completed its final safety evaluation report, concluding that there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a license for construction and operation of the proposed reactor. Following a mandatory hearing later this year, the commission will vote on whether to authorize the staff to issue the license. 
Company has made no decision to construct North Anna 3, but with the combined operating license, we'll preserve its option to do so should the Virginia State Corporation Commission believe it is in the best interest of our customers. The company has included new nuclear in its integrated resource plan as one option to meet future customer demand and comply with environmental regulations. 
Dominion Virginia Power connected 11 new data centers in 2016, 2 more than planned and 2 more than in 2015. We anticipate a similar number of centers to come online this year and each year through the end of the decade. In fact, we have already connected 1 new data center already this year. 
In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approvals and construction. $784 million worth of these facilities were completed last year, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year. 
Our strategic undergrounding program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. In August of 2016, State Corporation Commission approved Phase 1 and the recovery of $139 million capital investment to convert 412 miles of overhead cap lines to underground. We will invest $110 million in capital and convert an additional 244 miles of overhead cap lines during Phase 2. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 84% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially done. All major equipment has been set, and steel and pipe installation continues. 
We completed pressure testing of the air cooled condenser, and commissioning is underway for electrical, compressed air and water treatment. We expect to achieve completion of 95% or more of structural steel by the end of this quarter. The project continues on time and on budget to be in service later this year. 
We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft of our Environmental Impact Statement in December, in line with their permitting schedule. The report is favorable, and importantly, concluded that environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. 
ACP has essentially completed its design, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. The project budget has been updated for the construction plan, including the cost to reroute segments impacting U.S. forest service lands, and we now anticipate total development cost to the project, excluding financing cost, of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. ACP expects to maintain the returns on the project through a combination of construction contingencies and negotiated rate adjustments, as allowed by the existing customer agreements. 
We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019. 
A record 6 major pipeline expansion projects were placed into service in 2016, adding 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity for our customers. We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway, with $700 million of investment to move 900 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. 
We're seeing continued appetite for new pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a more open federal policy for infrastructure investments will increase drilling in the basin and increase demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will, in turn, accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. 
Based on these drivers, we expect to secure a number of new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2016. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we look forward to completion of these major projects, which will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year. 
As Mark stated, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive drivers will support continued growth in years to come, supporting an earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2020, off of our 2017 base year. 
Finally, because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And I guess, we've taken the approach today that no one knows what could happen with taxes. And so instead of giving some range out in terms of probabilities, we took a neutral stance. But the key drivers for us -- and remember, our mix is different than a lot of truly regulated companies, but the tax rate obviously is a key component on where that lands. Interest deductibility is a very large component for us because of our unregulated fleet and the amount of current interest that we deduct. Normalization, practices and our regulated operations, we operate in many, many states and day 1 expense -- so taken each one individually, they could have a positive or slightly negative impact, some greater than others. But because some of these may change or be offset, we think at this point, the best decision for us is to stay neutral until we get some additional clarity out of Congress."

Obviously, the power piece of it, which everybody -- there's real clarity on that. But the second is gas and oil prices that might impact our business, in particular at Blue Racer. Blue Racer's contribution versus previous estimates are going to be down significantly based on current oil and gas outlook. That can change. It could go up. But we wanted to normalize that in this growth rate. Also, the contributions at Hastings, a small processing plant that is housed within DTI, their contributions are also down from previous expectations based on the same liquids pricing events that are out there. So again, instead of taking a very bullish recovery in commodities, we've pretty much looked at the strip. And if your outlook is that, that is conservative based on a recovering economy in E&P and to others, then that could well happen.

Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. 
In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.  And now for the usual cautionary language. 
The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP.  Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for 2016 and Dominion's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we've made on our growth plans. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,415851984,1121339,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a",1171,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a result, operating earnings finished at $3.80 per share for the full year 2016, which was 10.5% above operating earnings for 2015. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments and our financial results for 2016.
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.44 per share for 2016. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter and the full year were charges associated with coal ash remediation at several of our closed coal-generating plants. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million, 94% higher than the level produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 63% to $37.7 million. 
On December 1, Dominion Midstream Partners completed the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion Resources. The acquisition more than doubled Dominion Midstream's ongoing adjusted EBITDA and is expected to cover our planned 22% distribution growth through mid- to late 2018. 
Finally, on January 25, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2605 per unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our distribution growth plans. 
Moving to treasury activities and earnings guidance at Dominion. 2016 marked the peak in our capital growth plan, with over $5 billion in growth CapEx and $4.4 billion acquisition of Questar.  During the year, we raised over $10 billion in capital to fund growth, make acquisitions and repay maturing debt. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.1 billion for 2016. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.4 billion. 
For our planned public debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
As we move into 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the anticipated asset drop into Dominion Midstream Partners in 2018, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically beginning next year, moving from negative to significantly positive. 
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash flow as Cove Point is dropped in Dominion Midstream Partners, which we'll use to reduce debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 85% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and 100% of first quarter productions. We also expect to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in the Northeast. 
Before we move to earnings guidance, let me comment briefly about anticipated federal tax law changes. Our preliminary analysis shows a wide range of potential outcomes depending on what decisions are made around the actual tax rate, interest deductibility, day 1 expensing and normalization. We have highlighted some of the key issues on Slide 8. 
Remember, different than many of our peers, we have a portfolio of nonregulated and long-term contracted cash flows that will be treated differently than our regulated portfolio. Based on our asset mix and public information to date, we would expect to be somewhat earnings-neutral to any final tax package. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. It has been evident for some time that 2017 will be a challenging year for Dominion to achieve its historical earnings growth rate. Now that we have hedged most of Millstone's 2017 expected output, we estimate a $10 to $12 per megawatt hour reduction in realized energy prices versus last year, impacting 2017 earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share. 
Also, as we have said on previous calls, we expect to generate about $0.30 per share in solar investment tax credits, a year-over-year reduction of almost $0.20 per share. As a result, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for 2017 is $3.40 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.15 per share or about 4% below operating earnings of $3.80 per share for 2016. Operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $0.90 to $1.10 per share. 
Moving to 2018, we believe operating earnings will increase by at least 10% over 2017. Cove Point export should provide between $0.40 and $0.45 per share of incremental earnings in 2018. Having one fewer refueling outage at Millstone should add another $0.10 per share to year-over-year results. Offsetting these growth drivers will be an expected further reduction in solar investment tax credits of $0.15 to $0.20 per share from 2017. We expect about $0.10 per share contributions from solar ITCs in 2018 and beyond, driven by customer needs in Virginia. While we are not providing a specific guidance range for 2018 today, you can see that these factors alone can support at least a 10% increase in year-over-year operating earnings. 
Looking to 2019 and beyond, we believe our growth opportunities continue to be one of the best in the energy industry. Some of the growth drivers to focus on are highlighted on Slide 11.  All of our business segments are well positioned to support strong growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to these organic growth drivers, Dominion will benefit through the use of about $7 billion in cash flow generated by asset contributions to our MLP. A portion of this cash flow will significantly reduce parent level debt and allow for share repurchases, as well as support our growth capital needs. 
With the growth we have highlighted, we expect 6% to 8% compounded average growth rate and earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry. 
So let me summarize my financial review. 
2016 operating earnings of $3.80 per share. 2017 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.90 per share. 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. 2017 through 2020, earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%. And we anticipate dividend growth of more than 8% per year beginning in 2018. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year.  I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the year, the highest since 2013 and the second highest since Millstone joined the fleet 16 years ago. Surry Unit 1 set a fleet record for the shortest refueling outage this fall, surpassing a record set at North Anna in 2015. 
Our Brunswick County Power Station, which began operating last April, has been honored with a number of industry awards, including Best Overall Generation Project of the Year and Excellence in Safety Best Project. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of year-end 2016, the $1.3 billion project was 19% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
5 solar projects were completed in the fourth quarter. The 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern shore went into service in October. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts went into service in December, along with a 60-megawatt solar facility in North Carolina.  For the full year 2016, 727 megawatts were added to our solar portfolio. 
We have a number of solar projects under development in the State of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. 
In November, we announced a major expansion of our solar alliance with Amazon Web Services to add 180 megawatts of new solar-generated capacity at sites in 5 Virginia counties, all of which are being serviced this year. In total, we have announced close to 300 megawatts that will go into service by year-end, bringing our operating portfolio to over 1,400 megawatts of solar-generated capacity. 
We have been working to secure a combined operating license for a third unit at our North Anna nuclear power station since 2009. Last month, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission completed its final safety evaluation report, concluding that there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a license for construction and operation of the proposed reactor. Following a mandatory hearing later this year, the commission will vote on whether to authorize the staff to issue the license. 
Company has made no decision to construct North Anna 3, but with the combined operating license, we'll preserve its option to do so should the Virginia State Corporation Commission believe it is in the best interest of our customers. The company has included new nuclear in its integrated resource plan as one option to meet future customer demand and comply with environmental regulations. 
Dominion Virginia Power connected 11 new data centers in 2016, 2 more than planned and 2 more than in 2015. We anticipate a similar number of centers to come online this year and each year through the end of the decade. In fact, we have already connected 1 new data center already this year. 
In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approvals and construction. $784 million worth of these facilities were completed last year, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year. 
Our strategic undergrounding program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. In August of 2016, State Corporation Commission approved Phase 1 and the recovery of $139 million capital investment to convert 412 miles of overhead cap lines to underground. We will invest $110 million in capital and convert an additional 244 miles of overhead cap lines during Phase 2. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 84% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially done. All major equipment has been set, and steel and pipe installation continues. 
We completed pressure testing of the air cooled condenser, and commissioning is underway for electrical, compressed air and water treatment. We expect to achieve completion of 95% or more of structural steel by the end of this quarter. The project continues on time and on budget to be in service later this year. 
We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft of our Environmental Impact Statement in December, in line with their permitting schedule. The report is favorable, and importantly, concluded that environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. 
ACP has essentially completed its design, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. The project budget has been updated for the construction plan, including the cost to reroute segments impacting U.S. forest service lands, and we now anticipate total development cost to the project, excluding financing cost, of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. ACP expects to maintain the returns on the project through a combination of construction contingencies and negotiated rate adjustments, as allowed by the existing customer agreements. 
We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019. 
A record 6 major pipeline expansion projects were placed into service in 2016, adding 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity for our customers. We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway, with $700 million of investment to move 900 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. 
We're seeing continued appetite for new pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a more open federal policy for infrastructure investments will increase drilling in the basin and increase demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will, in turn, accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. 
Based on these drivers, we expect to secure a number of new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2016. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we look forward to completion of these major projects, which will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year. 
As Mark stated, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive drivers will support continued growth in years to come, supporting an earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2020, off of our 2017 base year. 
Finally, because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And I guess, we've taken the approach today that no one knows what could happen with taxes. And so instead of giving some range out in terms of probabilities, we took a neutral stance. But the key drivers for us -- and remember, our mix is different than a lot of truly regulated companies, but the tax rate obviously is a key component on where that lands. Interest deductibility is a very large component for us because of our unregulated fleet and the amount of current interest that we deduct. Normalization, practices and our regulated operations, we operate in many, many states and day 1 expense -- so taken each one individually, they could have a positive or slightly negative impact, some greater than others. But because some of these may change or be offset, we think at this point, the best decision for us is to stay neutral until we get some additional clarity out of Congress."

But there's a couple of things to think about there. And when I referenced to Greg earlier that we've kind of reset the commodity deck here, that is a reference to really 2 parts of our business. Obviously, the power piece of it, which everybody -- there's real clarity on that. But the second is gas and oil prices that might impact our business, in particular at Blue Racer. Blue Racer's contribution versus previous estimates are going to be down significantly based on current oil and gas outlook. That can change. It could go up. But we wanted to normalize that in this growth rate. Also, the contributions at Hastings, a small processing plant that is housed within DTI, their contributions are also down from previous expectations based on the same liquids pricing events that are out there. So again, instead of taking a very bullish recovery in commodities, we've pretty much looked at the strip. And if your outlook is that, that is conservative based on a recovering economy in E&P and to others, then that could well happen. But those are the 2 biggest drivers in the '19 and '20 timeframe than what we would've talked about previously."

It had about 85 potential conditions in it, a number like that, which I think is fewer than we had at Cove Point actually for a much longer pipeline. So we were -- FERC had done a very thorough analysis, but we had done a lot of very thorough work before filing everything, that any major reroutes were already all scoped out before the draft Environmental Impact Statement came out. Comment period is underway. Public hearings will be heard starting at the end of this month, then it'll all be wrapped up in early March. So we don't see any hurdles to getting our final EIS out in June as it's scheduled. There's an issue I know people may have with going down to 2 FERC commissioners here, I guess, about a week or few days. We don't need to have a full complement or a quorum at FERC until summertime to be on our schedule. So I'm highly confident that the President will appoint folks by then, they'll be confirmed by the Senate and seated. So we think it's going extremely well. We've signed our construction contract. All taking into account all the changes that were necessary as part of the rerouting through the mountains and the forests, the national forests. So all in all, ACP is going extremely well."

267105,415851984,1122001,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a",1171,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a result, operating earnings finished at $3.80 per share for the full year 2016, which was 10.5% above operating earnings for 2015. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments and our financial results for 2016.
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.44 per share for 2016. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter and the full year were charges associated with coal ash remediation at several of our closed coal-generating plants. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million, 94% higher than the level produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 63% to $37.7 million. 
On December 1, Dominion Midstream Partners completed the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion Resources. The acquisition more than doubled Dominion Midstream's ongoing adjusted EBITDA and is expected to cover our planned 22% distribution growth through mid- to late 2018. 
Finally, on January 25, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2605 per unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our distribution growth plans. 
Moving to treasury activities and earnings guidance at Dominion. 2016 marked the peak in our capital growth plan, with over $5 billion in growth CapEx and $4.4 billion acquisition of Questar.  During the year, we raised over $10 billion in capital to fund growth, make acquisitions and repay maturing debt. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.1 billion for 2016. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.4 billion. 
For our planned public debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
As we move into 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the anticipated asset drop into Dominion Midstream Partners in 2018, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically beginning next year, moving from negative to significantly positive. 
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash flow as Cove Point is dropped in Dominion Midstream Partners, which we'll use to reduce debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 85% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and 100% of first quarter productions. We also expect to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in the Northeast. 
Before we move to earnings guidance, let me comment briefly about anticipated federal tax law changes. Our preliminary analysis shows a wide range of potential outcomes depending on what decisions are made around the actual tax rate, interest deductibility, day 1 expensing and normalization. We have highlighted some of the key issues on Slide 8. 
Remember, different than many of our peers, we have a portfolio of nonregulated and long-term contracted cash flows that will be treated differently than our regulated portfolio. Based on our asset mix and public information to date, we would expect to be somewhat earnings-neutral to any final tax package. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. It has been evident for some time that 2017 will be a challenging year for Dominion to achieve its historical earnings growth rate. Now that we have hedged most of Millstone's 2017 expected output, we estimate a $10 to $12 per megawatt hour reduction in realized energy prices versus last year, impacting 2017 earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share. 
Also, as we have said on previous calls, we expect to generate about $0.30 per share in solar investment tax credits, a year-over-year reduction of almost $0.20 per share. As a result, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for 2017 is $3.40 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.15 per share or about 4% below operating earnings of $3.80 per share for 2016. Operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $0.90 to $1.10 per share. 
Moving to 2018, we believe operating earnings will increase by at least 10% over 2017. Cove Point export should provide between $0.40 and $0.45 per share of incremental earnings in 2018. Having one fewer refueling outage at Millstone should add another $0.10 per share to year-over-year results. Offsetting these growth drivers will be an expected further reduction in solar investment tax credits of $0.15 to $0.20 per share from 2017. We expect about $0.10 per share contributions from solar ITCs in 2018 and beyond, driven by customer needs in Virginia. While we are not providing a specific guidance range for 2018 today, you can see that these factors alone can support at least a 10% increase in year-over-year operating earnings. 
Looking to 2019 and beyond, we believe our growth opportunities continue to be one of the best in the energy industry. Some of the growth drivers to focus on are highlighted on Slide 11.  All of our business segments are well positioned to support strong growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to these organic growth drivers, Dominion will benefit through the use of about $7 billion in cash flow generated by asset contributions to our MLP. A portion of this cash flow will significantly reduce parent level debt and allow for share repurchases, as well as support our growth capital needs. 
With the growth we have highlighted, we expect 6% to 8% compounded average growth rate and earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry. 
So let me summarize my financial review. 
2016 operating earnings of $3.80 per share. 2017 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.90 per share. 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. 2017 through 2020, earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%. And we anticipate dividend growth of more than 8% per year beginning in 2018. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year.  I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the year, the highest since 2013 and the second highest since Millstone joined the fleet 16 years ago. Surry Unit 1 set a fleet record for the shortest refueling outage this fall, surpassing a record set at North Anna in 2015. 
Our Brunswick County Power Station, which began operating last April, has been honored with a number of industry awards, including Best Overall Generation Project of the Year and Excellence in Safety Best Project. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of year-end 2016, the $1.3 billion project was 19% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
5 solar projects were completed in the fourth quarter. The 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern shore went into service in October. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts went into service in December, along with a 60-megawatt solar facility in North Carolina.  For the full year 2016, 727 megawatts were added to our solar portfolio. 
We have a number of solar projects under development in the State of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. 
In November, we announced a major expansion of our solar alliance with Amazon Web Services to add 180 megawatts of new solar-generated capacity at sites in 5 Virginia counties, all of which are being serviced this year. In total, we have announced close to 300 megawatts that will go into service by year-end, bringing our operating portfolio to over 1,400 megawatts of solar-generated capacity. 
We have been working to secure a combined operating license for a third unit at our North Anna nuclear power station since 2009. Last month, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission completed its final safety evaluation report, concluding that there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a license for construction and operation of the proposed reactor. Following a mandatory hearing later this year, the commission will vote on whether to authorize the staff to issue the license. 
Company has made no decision to construct North Anna 3, but with the combined operating license, we'll preserve its option to do so should the Virginia State Corporation Commission believe it is in the best interest of our customers. The company has included new nuclear in its integrated resource plan as one option to meet future customer demand and comply with environmental regulations. 
Dominion Virginia Power connected 11 new data centers in 2016, 2 more than planned and 2 more than in 2015. We anticipate a similar number of centers to come online this year and each year through the end of the decade. In fact, we have already connected 1 new data center already this year. 
In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approvals and construction. $784 million worth of these facilities were completed last year, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year. 
Our strategic undergrounding program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. In August of 2016, State Corporation Commission approved Phase 1 and the recovery of $139 million capital investment to convert 412 miles of overhead cap lines to underground. We will invest $110 million in capital and convert an additional 244 miles of overhead cap lines during Phase 2. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 84% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially done. All major equipment has been set, and steel and pipe installation continues. 
We completed pressure testing of the air cooled condenser, and commissioning is underway for electrical, compressed air and water treatment. We expect to achieve completion of 95% or more of structural steel by the end of this quarter. The project continues on time and on budget to be in service later this year. 
We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft of our Environmental Impact Statement in December, in line with their permitting schedule. The report is favorable, and importantly, concluded that environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. 
ACP has essentially completed its design, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. The project budget has been updated for the construction plan, including the cost to reroute segments impacting U.S. forest service lands, and we now anticipate total development cost to the project, excluding financing cost, of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. ACP expects to maintain the returns on the project through a combination of construction contingencies and negotiated rate adjustments, as allowed by the existing customer agreements. 
We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019. 
A record 6 major pipeline expansion projects were placed into service in 2016, adding 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity for our customers. We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway, with $700 million of investment to move 900 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. 
We're seeing continued appetite for new pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a more open federal policy for infrastructure investments will increase drilling in the basin and increase demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will, in turn, accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. 
Based on these drivers, we expect to secure a number of new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2016. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we look forward to completion of these major projects, which will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year. 
As Mark stated, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive drivers will support continued growth in years to come, supporting an earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2020, off of our 2017 base year. 
Finally, because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And we say neutral, we've run a number of different cases. Some would be positive. Some would be slightly negative. And I guess, we've taken the approach today that no one knows what could happen with taxes. And so instead of giving some range out in terms of probabilities, we took a neutral stance. But the key drivers for us -- and remember, our mix is different than a lot of truly regulated companies, but the tax rate obviously is a key component on where that lands. Interest deductibility is a very large component for us because of our unregulated fleet and the amount of current interest that we deduct. Normalization, practices and our regulated operations, we operate in many, many states and day 1 expense -- so taken each one individually, they could have a positive or slightly negative impact, some greater than others. But because some of these may change or be offset, we think at this point, the best decision for us is to stay neutral until we get some additional clarity out of Congress."

Obviously, the power piece of it, which everybody -- there's real clarity on that. But the second is gas and oil prices that might impact our business, in particular at Blue Racer. Blue Racer's contribution versus previous estimates are going to be down significantly based on current oil and gas outlook. That can change. It could go up. But we wanted to normalize that in this growth rate. Also, the contributions at Hastings, a small processing plant that is housed within DTI, their contributions are also down from previous expectations based on the same liquids pricing events that are out there. So again, instead of taking a very bullish recovery in commodities, we've pretty much looked at the strip. And if your outlook is that, that is conservative based on a recovering economy in E&P and to others, then that could well happen.

So you said out of the $7 billion of cash that's going to be coming from Cove Point, $3 billion to $4 billion will be used for debt pay-down, and then the rest split between buybacks, dividends and then growth. Can you give us a little bit more of a sense? I mean, you are giving us EPS growth targets. So just roughly, what is the number embedded for buybacks, so that we actually can get a share count? And is there a way, for instance, you could shift some of the money to make, I don't know, accretive acquisitions that could boost that growth trajectory?"

So that's a few hundred million dollars. Beyond that, we'll have to see what the opportunities are, Angie, before I can tell you specifically how much the share repurchase versus organic.

Comment period is underway. Public hearings will be heard starting at the end of this month, then it'll all be wrapped up in early March.

There's an issue I know people may have with going down to 2 FERC commissioners here, I guess, about a week or few days. We don't need to have a full complement or a quorum at FERC until summertime to be on our schedule.

Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, positive factors for the quarter were higher weather normalized electric sales, lower income taxes and lower operating expenses.
GAAP earnings were $1.01 per share for the first quarter.

Moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power recorded EBITDA of $414 million for the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by higher weather normalized sales and revenues and higher than planned earnings from electric transmission. EBITDA at Dominion Generation was $695 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were higher weather normalized sales in revenues, lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher-than-expected realized margins from our merchant plants.
Dominion Energy produced EBITDA of $582 million, just under the midpoint of its guidance range. Mild weather impact the results from the LDCs and retail.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results from our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $75.4 million, which was 3x the level produced in the first quarter of last year. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. Distributable cash flow of $44.1 million was more than double the level of last year's first quarter.
On April 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.274 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan.
Now moving to treasury activities at Dominion. Cash flow from operating activities were $1.4 billion for the first quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $3.2 billion. For our planned debt financings in 3017, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As we move through 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the planned asset drop into Dominion Midstream Partners, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically, moving from negative to significantly positive.
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to receive  [7 to 8 ] [indiscernible] of cash between 2016 and 2020 from Dominion Midstream Partners, which will be used to reduce to Dominion level debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock. As to hedging, you can find our hedge position on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
We have hedged 89% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We plan to limit our hedging for 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in Connecticut. This legislation, which was voted out of committee and will be taken up by the full House and Senate, would allow Millstone to to bid into a competitive procurement conducted by Connecticut regulators to secure carbon free energy for the states customers. That will potentially cover up to 1/2 of Millstone's expected output for 5 years. The legislation session in Connecticut is scheduled to adjourn on June 7. If approved, will likely take place this fall for power deliveries beginning sometime next year. 
Now the earnings guidance at Dominion. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.70 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the second quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather and sales growth at Virginia Power. Negative factors compared to last year are lower earnings from Cove Point due to the rolloff of one of our import contracts, lower investment tax credits from solar investments and lower realized margins at Millstone. 
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for all of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017 driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which is expected to be in-service late this year.
With the growth we expect across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the utility space.
So let me summarize my financial review. First quarter operating earnings were $0.97 per share. Weather normalized earnings were $1.05 per share. Second quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 per share, and 2018 earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And finally, our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,427334755,1189656,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time [indiscernible] recordable rate",1374,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time [indiscernible] recordable rate of 0.66 last year, and we have a goal of improving on that record this year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units during the first quarter was over 100%.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined power station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 30% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators, as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. With the major equipment on-site, the risk of the schedule is greatly reduced. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continued to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. In total, we have announced 408 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatt by the end of next year, bringing our growth operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
We have begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginina General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pump [indiscernible] electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with cost also recoverable through a rider. 
We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $784 million worth of these assets were completed in 2016, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million dollars in our electric transmission business this year.
Our strategic underground program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly founded support for the program and clarified the standards by which the lines will be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events.
We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. New customer connections at Virginia Power in the first quarter were 17% higher than last year. We also connected 3 new data centers in the first quarter, 2 more than in the first quarter of last year and anticipating connecting 8 to 9 new data centers each year through the end of the decade. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. 
All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue. Partners on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 89% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping are coming to completion, and the post inflation testing is about 60% complete. Over half of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, on line would schedule. 
As we work toward commercial and service later this year, we will be commissioning the power block this quarter and begin to ramp down the construction related labor. Last month, FERC approved our request to begin flowing gas to the site in order to begin firing the 2 boilers, with the step in the commissioning. The boiler's first test was completed last week. Third quarter will bring the project to a state of ready for start up, and construction will reach essentially complete status. We have filed a request with the Department of Energy to export energy produced during commissioning. 
Finally, the fourth quarter will provided a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service late this year. 
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related supply project. FERC issued a environmental impact statement in December. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and that there would be no significant public safety impacts. The public comment period ended in early April. And this week, we filed responses to FERC information request and all of the comments received during the public comment period.
After receiving a final EIS this summer, we expect to receive a permit from FERC late summer or early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year. 
ACP and supply have essentially completed the design and engineerings, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction the second half of this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the supplier in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway with $700 million of investment. Five of these projects are expected to be completed this year. We are seeing continued interest in pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe our federal policy that supports infrastructure investments will increase drilling activity and gas demand from industrials and other sectors. 
Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will in turn accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. Based on these factors, we expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system, and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the project. And as we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year. 
As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.
Finally, this will be the last earnings call for Dominion Resources. Following a shareholder approval at next week's annual meeting, the company's name will change to Dominion Energy in recognition of our focus on the public energy marketplace and to unify our brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The new logo is shown on Slide 17.
Our electric and gas companies will unify under the single brand and change their doing business names in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The names of our operating segments will change as well to the Power Delivery group, the Power Generation group and the Gas Infrastructure group. We will begin using these names in our reporting of operating results next quarter. The name of our master limited partnership will change to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The ticker symbols for both companies remain the same. 
Our company and our employees are proud of the work we've done in delivering energy for 119 years and the repetition we have built through reliable and affordable service.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Solar passed the economic test in any significant amount, and that IRP says you could logically build up to 5,200 megawatts of solar over the next 15 years. Now as you know, as you build more renewables like that, that comes hand-in-hand with pipelines and gas-fired heaters to support the renewables when they are unable to operate.

Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operat",977,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.05 per share, which was near the top of our guidance range. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, positive factors for the quarter were higher weather-normalized electric sales, lower income taxes and lower operating expenses.
GAAP earnings were $1.01 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were gains recorded in our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power recorded EBITDA of $414 million for the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by higher weather-normalized sales and revenues and higher-than-planned earnings from electric transmission.
EBITDA at Dominion Generation was $695 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were higher weather-normalized sales and revenues, lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher-than-expected realized margins from our merchant plants.
Dominion Energy produced EBITDA of $582 million, just under the midpoint of its guidance range. Mild weather impacted results from the LDCs and retail. Overall, we're very pleased with the results from our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $75.4 million, which was 3x the level produced in the first quarter of last year. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. Distributable cash flow of $44.1 million was more than double the level of last year's first quarter.
On April 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.274 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan.
Now moving to treasury activities at Dominion. Cash flow from operating activities were $1.4 billion for the first quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $3.2 billion. For our planned debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As we move through 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the planned asset drop in Dominion Midstream Partners, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically, moving from negative to significantly positive.
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to receive $7 billion to $8 billion of cash between 2016 and 2020 from Dominion Midstream Partners, which will be used to reduce Dominion level debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge position on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 89% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We plan to limit our hedging for 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in Connecticut. This legislation, which was voted out of committee and will be taken up by the full House and Senate, would allow Millstone to bid into a competitive procurement conducted by Connecticut regulators to secure carbon-free energy for the state's customers. It will potentially cover up to 1/2 of Millstone's expected output for 5 years. The legislation session in Connecticut is scheduled to adjourn on June 7. If approved, the competitive auction would likely take place this fall for power delivery beginning sometime next year.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.70 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the second quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather and sales growth at Virginia Power. Negative factors compared to last year are lower earnings from Cove Point due to the rolloff of one of our import contracts, lower investment tax credits from solar investments and lower realized margins at Millstone.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for all of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which is expected to be in service late this year.
With the growth we expect across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the utilities space.
So let me summarize my financial review. First quarter operating earnings were $0.97 per share. Weather normalized earnings were $1.05 per share. Second quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 per share, and 2018 earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And finally, our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter.

All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year, and we have a goal of improving on that record this year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units during the first quarter was over 100%.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 30% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. With the major equipment on-site, the risk of the schedule is greatly reduced. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. In total, we have announced 408 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
We have begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The General Assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pumped storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with cost also recoverable through a rider.
We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $784 million worth of these assets were completed in 2016, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million dollars in our electric transmission business this year.
Our strategic underground program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which the distribution lines will be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events.
We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. New customer connections at Virginia Power in the first quarter were 17% higher than last year. We also connected 3 new data centers in the first quarter, 2 more than in the first quarter of last year and anticipating connecting 8 to 9 new data centers each year through the end of the decade. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation.
All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue. [ Partners ] on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 89% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is about 60% complete. Over half of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, on line with schedule.
As we work toward commercial and service later this year, we will be commissioning a power block this quarter and begin to ramp down the construction-related labor. Last month, FERC approved our request to begin flowing gas to the site in order to begin firing the 2 auxiliary boilers, with a step in the power block commissioning. The boiler's first test was successfully completed last week.
Third quarter will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up, and construction will reach essentially complete status. We have filed a request with the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. Finally, the fourth quarter will provided a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service late this year.
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft environmental impact statement in December. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and that there would be no significant public safety impacts. The public comment period ended in early April. And this week, we filed responses to FERC information request and all of the comments received during the public comment period.
After receiving a final EIS this summer, we expect to receive final permit from FERC by late summer or early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year.
ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction in the second half of this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the supplier in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway with $700 million of investment. 5 of these projects are expected to be completed this year. We are seeing continued interest in pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe our federal policy that supports infrastructure investments will increase drilling activity and gas demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will in turn accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions.
Based on these factors, we expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. And as we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year.
As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.
Finally, this will be the last earnings call for Dominion Resources. Following shareholder approval at next week's annual meeting, the company's name will change to Dominion Energy in recognition of our focus on the evolving energy marketplace and to unify our brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The new logo is shown on Slide 17.
Our electric and gas distribution companies will unify under the single brand and change their doing business names in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The names of our operating segments will change as well to the Power Delivery Group, the Power Generation Group and the Gas Infrastructure Group. We will begin using these names in our reporting of operating results next quarter. The name of our master limited partnership will change to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The ticker symbols for both companies remain the same.
Our company and our employees are proud of the work we've done in delivering energy for 119 years and of the reputation we have built through reliable and affordable service. With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,427334755,1189967,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operat",977,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.05 per share, which was near the top of our guidance range. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, positive factors for the quarter were higher weather-normalized electric sales, lower income taxes and lower operating expenses.
GAAP earnings were $1.01 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were gains recorded in our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power recorded EBITDA of $414 million for the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by higher weather-normalized sales and revenues and higher-than-planned earnings from electric transmission.
EBITDA at Dominion Generation was $695 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were higher weather-normalized sales and revenues, lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher-than-expected realized margins from our merchant plants.
Dominion Energy produced EBITDA of $582 million, just under the midpoint of its guidance range. Mild weather impacted results from the LDCs and retail. Overall, we're very pleased with the results from our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $75.4 million, which was 3x the level produced in the first quarter of last year. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. Distributable cash flow of $44.1 million was more than double the level of last year's first quarter.
On April 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.274 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan.
Now moving to treasury activities at Dominion. Cash flow from operating activities were $1.4 billion for the first quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $3.2 billion. For our planned debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As we move through 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the planned asset drop in Dominion Midstream Partners, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically, moving from negative to significantly positive.
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to receive $7 billion to $8 billion of cash between 2016 and 2020 from Dominion Midstream Partners, which will be used to reduce Dominion level debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge position on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 89% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We plan to limit our hedging for 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in Connecticut. This legislation, which was voted out of committee and will be taken up by the full House and Senate, would allow Millstone to bid into a competitive procurement conducted by Connecticut regulators to secure carbon-free energy for the state's customers. It will potentially cover up to 1/2 of Millstone's expected output for 5 years. The legislation session in Connecticut is scheduled to adjourn on June 7. If approved, the competitive auction would likely take place this fall for power delivery beginning sometime next year.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.70 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the second quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather and sales growth at Virginia Power. Negative factors compared to last year are lower earnings from Cove Point due to the rolloff of one of our import contracts, lower investment tax credits from solar investments and lower realized margins at Millstone.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for all of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which is expected to be in service late this year.
With the growth we expect across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the utilities space.
So let me summarize my financial review. First quarter operating earnings were $0.97 per share. Weather normalized earnings were $1.05 per share. Second quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 per share, and 2018 earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And finally, our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 l",1389,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year, and we have a goal of improving on that record this year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units during the first quarter was over 100%.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 30% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. With the major equipment on-site, the risk of the schedule is greatly reduced. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. In total, we have announced 408 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
We have begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The General Assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pumped storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with cost also recoverable through a rider.
We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $784 million worth of these assets were completed in 2016, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million dollars in our electric transmission business this year.
Our strategic underground program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which the distribution lines will be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events.
We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. New customer connections at Virginia Power in the first quarter were 17% higher than last year. We also connected 3 new data centers in the first quarter, 2 more than in the first quarter of last year and anticipating connecting 8 to 9 new data centers each year through the end of the decade. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation.
All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue. [ Partners ] on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 89% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is about 60% complete. Over half of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, on line with schedule.
As we work toward commercial and service later this year, we will be commissioning a power block this quarter and begin to ramp down the construction-related labor. Last month, FERC approved our request to begin flowing gas to the site in order to begin firing the 2 auxiliary boilers, a step in the power block commissioning. The boiler's first test was successfully completed last week.
Third quarter will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up, and construction will reach essentially complete status. We have filed a request with the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. Finally, the fourth quarter will provided a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service late this year.
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft environmental impact statement in December. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and that there would be no significant public safety impacts. The public comment period ended in early April. And this week, we filed responses to FERC information request and all of the comments received during the public comment period.
After receiving a final EIS this summer, we expect to receive final permit from FERC by late summer or early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year.
ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction in the second half of this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway with $700 million of investment. 5 of these projects are expected to be completed this year. We are seeing continued interest in pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe our federal policy that supports infrastructure investments will increase drilling activity and gas demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will in turn accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions.
Based on these factors, we expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. And as we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year.
As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.
Finally, this will be the last earnings call for Dominion Resources. Following shareholder approval at next week's annual meeting, the company's name will change to Dominion Energy in recognition of our focus on the evolving energy marketplace and to unify our brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The new logo is shown on Slide 17.
Our electric and gas distribution companies will unify under the single brand and change their doing business names in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The names of our operating segments will change as well to the Power Delivery Group, the Power Generation Group and the Gas Infrastructure Group. We will begin using these names in our reporting of operating results next quarter. The name of our master limited partnership will change to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The ticker symbols for both companies remain the same.
Our company and our employees are proud of the work we've done in delivering energy for 119 years and of the reputation we have built through reliable and affordable service. With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

We have our undergrounding distribution, undergrounding rider that covers 4,000 miles of our -- now we have 56,000 miles of distribution lines in Virginia, but about 4,000 of them are -- have a higher likelihood of extended outages when we get significant storms because of the topography or the trees that are in the neighborhoods or whatever. So we're -- we've been working on those. The new one, I'm not sure -- focus on the fact that we actually own 60% of and operate 100% of the world's largest pumped storage facility in Virginia at our Bath County Power Station. It's the closest thing to a real battery that can work with renewables that is of any scale. We've been looking in the southwestern part of our state that could use continued economic development, and those will be subject to riders as well. So and then if you are continuing to operate a coal facility and you need expenses around environmental spending to keep that plant operated, for example, coal ash pond remediation and -- et cetera. It's also recoverable through a rider. So there's lots of opportunities. And as we said, our the Virginia economy is beginning to perk up a little bit. New connects were 17% higher in the first quarter, and the sales growth is strong. Mark can give you the details on that.

267105,427334755,1194365,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operat",977,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather, including a record mild February, reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.05 per share, which was near the top of our guidance range. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, positive factors for the quarter were higher weather-normalized electric sales, lower income taxes and lower operating expenses.
GAAP earnings were $1.01 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were gains recorded in our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power recorded EBITDA of $414 million for the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by higher weather-normalized sales and revenues and higher-than-planned earnings from electric transmission.
EBITDA at Dominion Generation was $695 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were higher weather-normalized sales and revenues, lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher-than-expected realized margins from our merchant plants.
Dominion Energy produced EBITDA of $582 million, just under the midpoint of its guidance range. Mild weather impacted results from the LDCs and retail. Overall, we're very pleased with the results from our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $75.4 million, which was 3x the level produced in the first quarter of last year. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. Distributable cash flow of $44.1 million was more than double the level of last year's first quarter.
On April 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.274 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan.
Now moving to treasury activities at Dominion. Cash flow from operating activities were $1.4 billion for the first quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $3.2 billion. For our planned debt financings in 2017, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As we move through 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the planned asset drop in Dominion Midstream Partners, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically, moving from negative to significantly positive.
As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to receive $7 billion to $8 billion of cash between 2016 and 2020 from Dominion Midstream Partners, which will be used to reduce Dominion level debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge position on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 89% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We plan to limit our hedging for 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in Connecticut. This legislation, which was voted out of committee and will be taken up by the full House and Senate, would allow Millstone to bid into a competitive procurement conducted by Connecticut regulators to secure carbon-free energy for the state's customers. It will potentially cover up to 1/2 of Millstone's expected output for 5 years. The legislation session in Connecticut is scheduled to adjourn on June 7. If approved, the competitive auction would likely take place this fall for power delivery beginning sometime next year.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.70 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the second quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather and sales growth at Virginia Power. Negative factors compared to last year are lower earnings from Cove Point due to the rolloff of one of our import contracts, lower investment tax credits from solar investments and lower realized margins at Millstone.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for all of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which is expected to be in service late this year.
With the growth we expect across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the utilities space.
So let me summarize my financial review. First quarter operating earnings were $0.97 per share. Weather normalized earnings were $1.05 per share. Second quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 per share, and 2018 earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And finally, our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 l",1389,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units, either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year, and we have a goal of improving on that record this year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units during the first quarter was over 100%.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 30% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. With the major equipment on-site, the risk of the schedule is greatly reduced. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. In total, we have announced 408 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
We have begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The General Assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pumped storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with cost also recoverable through a rider.
We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $784 million worth of these assets were completed in 2016, including our new system operations center. We plan to invest $800 million dollars in our electric transmission business this year.
Our strategic underground program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which the distribution lines will be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events.
We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. New customer connections at Virginia Power in the first quarter were 17% higher than last year. We also connected 3 new data centers in the first quarter, 2 more than in the first quarter of last year and anticipating connecting 8 to 9 new data centers each year through the end of the decade. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation.
All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue. [ Partners ] on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 89% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is about 60% complete. Over half of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, on line with schedule.
As we work toward commercial and service later this year, we will be commissioning a power block this quarter and begin to ramp down the construction-related labor. Last month, FERC approved our request to begin flowing gas to the site in order to begin firing the 2 auxiliary boilers, a step in the power block commissioning. The boiler's first test was successfully completed last week.
Third quarter will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up, and construction will reach essentially complete status. We have filed a request with the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. Finally, the fourth quarter will provided a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service late this year.
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its draft environmental impact statement in December. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and that there would be no significant public safety impacts. The public comment period ended in early April. And this week, we filed responses to FERC information request and all of the comments received during the public comment period.
After receiving a final EIS this summer, we expect to receive final permit from FERC by late summer or early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year.
ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 80% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction in the second half of this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 6 pipeline growth projects underway with $700 million of investment. 5 of these projects are expected to be completed this year. We are seeing continued interest in pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe our federal policy that supports infrastructure investments will increase drilling activity and gas demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will in turn accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions.
Based on these factors, we expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. And as we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year.
As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.
Finally, this will be the last earnings call for Dominion Resources. Following shareholder approval at next week's annual meeting, the company's name will change to Dominion Energy in recognition of our focus on the evolving energy marketplace and to unify our brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The new logo is shown on Slide 17.
Our electric and gas distribution companies will unify under the single brand and change their doing business names in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The names of our operating segments will change as well to the Power Delivery Group, the Power Generation Group and the Gas Infrastructure Group. We will begin using these names in our reporting of operating results next quarter. The name of our master limited partnership will change to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The ticker symbols for both companies remain the same.
Our company and our employees are proud of the work we've done in delivering energy for 119 years and of the reputation we have built through reliable and affordable service. With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes",760,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes, while the principal negative driver continue to be below normal weather. In fact, the earnings impact of mild weather during the first half of the year was $0.10 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. Power delivery produced EBITDA of $422 million for the second quarter, which was in the middle of this guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses.
EBITDA at power generation was $554 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were lower operating and maintenance expenses. Gas infrastructure produced EBITDA in the upper half of its guidance range at $423 million. Higher transportation and distribution margins were the principal drivers of the strong results. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the results of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $68.6 million, which was 2x the level produced in the second quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow of $40.7 million was 70% higher than the level of last year's second quarter. 
The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. 
On July 21, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.288 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. 
Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.24x. 
Moving to treasury activities. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion for the second quarter. We had $5.5 billion of credit facilities and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we entered the quarter with available liquidity of $2.7 billion. For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7, and for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 95% of our expected 2017 production at millstone and have started hedging 2018 production. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislations in Connecticut. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2017 is expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share, compared to operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the third quarter compared to last year include the addition of Questar operations. 
Negative factors compared to last year include a return to normal weather, lower earnings from Cove Point due to the rollout of one of our import contracts, higher PJMs electric capacity expenses and lower investment tax credits from solar investments. Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share.
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which will be in service later this year.
With the plain growth across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings of our 2017 base through 2020. Not only this is one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate greater than 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion Energy provides investors of one of the best total return opportunities in the industry.
So let me summarize my financial review. Second quarter operating earnings were $0.67 per share, leaning in the upper half of our guidance range. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.15 per share. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And our 2017 to 2020 compound earnings growth rate to be 6% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. The air cooler condenser is over 60% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. Three of these facilities totaling 190 megawatts achieved commercial operations during the second quarter. 
In total, we have announced 438 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to 1800 megawatts, about 700, of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina. 
We've begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with cost also recoverable through a rider.
We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. 
In July, we announced that we've signed an agreement with [indiscernible] Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 6 megawatt turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy remains the sole owner of the turbines, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek rider recovery in Virginia for the project. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the first half of the year, $327 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter, for at least the next decade. 
Our strategic underground program continues power delivery. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which distribution lines would be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events. 
We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. Weather-normalized electric sales were up about 2% for the first half of the year, led by strong increases in sales to data center and residential customers. New customer's connections in the first half of the year were 7% higher than last year. We also connected 5 new data centers in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 8. In addition, anticipated increased total spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue.
Progress on our growth plan for gas infrastructure continues as well. 
Our Cove Point liquefaction project is now 95% complete and remains on time and on budget. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is essentially complete. Both phases of the operator simulator training have been successfully completed. Synchronization of a steam turbine generator to the existing plant generation grid will be completed this month. Over 90% of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, in line with our schedule.
As we work towards commercial and service later this year, we will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up this quarter, and construction will reach essentially complete status. 
On July 24, FERC provided authorization for hydrocarbon entry in the 4 additional project areas. We have received authorization from the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. We have an agreement with a third-party to provide the commissioning natural gas and to export commissioning LNG from the facility. Finally, the fourth quarter will provide a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service date later this year.
We are continuing to work toward commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On July 21, FERC issued its final Environmental Impact Statement. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there will be no significant public safety impacts. We expect to receive the final certificate from FERC in the early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 84% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction later this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 7 pipeline growth projects underway with over $750 million of investments. Our keys project was completed earlier this year, and we expect 4 more to be completed by year-end. We are also investing nearly $300 million per year in our local gas distribution companies in 3 states to our infrastructure replacement programs.
These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 states. 
We are seeing continued interest in expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC loads router system, and expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our business delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is nearly complete and commissioning is well underway. We received a file of our mail impact statement and continue to work towards commencement of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. As we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings growth starting next year. As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy higher than 8% per year. You can expect more clarity on our long-term growth plan and ongoing dividend policy at this fall's investor conferences. With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes",759,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes, while the principal negative driver continue to be below-normal weather. In fact, the earnings impact of mild weather during the first half of the year was $0.10 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $422 million for the second quarter, which was in the middle of this guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses.
EBITDA at Power Generation was $554 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were lower operating and maintenance expenses. 
Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA in the upper half of its guidance range at $423 million. Higher transportation and distribution margins were the principal drivers of the strong results. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the results of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $68.6 million, which was 2x the level produced in the second quarter of last year. 
Distributable cash flow of $40.7 million was 70% higher than the level of last year's second quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. 
On July 21, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.288 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. 
Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.24x. 
Moving to treasury activities. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion for the second quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we entered the quarter with available liquidity of $2.7 billion. 
For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 95% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislations in Connecticut. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2017 is expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the third quarter compared to last year include the addition of Questar operations. Negative factors compared to last year include a return to normal weather, lower earnings from Cove Point due to the roll-off of one of our import contracts, higher PJM electric capacity expenses and lower investment tax credits from solar investments. 
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share.
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which will be in service later this year.
With the planned growth across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off our 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate greater than 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion Energy provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry.
So let me summarize my financial review. 
Second quarter operating earnings were $0.67 per share, landing in the upper half of our guidance range. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.15 per share. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017, and our 2017 to 2020 compound earnings growth rate to be 6% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

I'm pleased that our employees set at an all-time low OSHA record",1294,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first half of the year. I'm pleased that our employees set at an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year and have a goal of improving on that record this year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the second quarter was over 96%. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of June 30, the $1.3 billion project was 47% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. The air-cooled condenser is over 60% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. Three of these facilities totaling 119 megawatts achieved commercial operations during the second quarter. 
In total, we've announced 438 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina. 
We've begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with costs also recoverable through a Rider. We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. 
In July, we announced that we've signed an agreement with DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 6-megawatt turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy remains the sole owner of the turbines, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek Rider recovery in Virginia for the project. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the first half of the year, $327 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade. 
Our strategic underground program continues at Power Delivery. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which distribution lines would be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events. 
We see improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. Weather-normalized electric sales were up about 2% for the first half of the year, led by strong increases in sales to data center and residential customers. New customer connections in the first half of the year were 7% higher than last year. We also connected 5 new data centers in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 8. In addition, anticipated increased total spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. 
Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 95% complete and remains on time and on budget. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large-diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is essentially complete. Both phases of the operator simulator training have been successfully completed. Synchronization of a steam turbine generator to the existing plant generation grid will be completed this month. Over 90% of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, in line with our schedule.
As we work towards commercial in-service later this year, we will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up this quarter, and construction will reach essentially complete status. 
On July 24, FERC provided authorization for hydrocarbon entry into the 4 additional project areas. We have received authorization from the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. We have an agreement with a third-party to provide the commissioning natural gas and to export commissioning LNG from the facility.   Finally, the fourth quarter will provide a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service date later this year.
We are continuing to work toward commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On July 21, FERC issued its final Environmental Impact Statement. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. We expect to receive the final certificate from FERC in the early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 84% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction later this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 7 pipeline growth projects under way with over $750 million of investment. Our Keys project was completed earlier this year, and we expect 4 more to be completed by year-end. We are also investing nearly $300 million per year in our local gas distribution companies in 3 states through our infrastructure replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 states. 
We're seeing continued interest in expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC loads router system, and expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian Basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is nearly complete and commissioning is well under way. We received a final Environmental Impact Statement and continue to work toward commencement of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. 
As we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings growth starting next year. As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy higher than 8% per year. You can expect more clarity on our long-term growth plan and ongoing dividend policy at this fall's investor conferences. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

We've been working on this for a number of years, long, many years, trying to find a partner who would give us the kind of certainty we needed on the cost to protect our customers so that we could go to our commission because it will need commission approval to authorize construction of the turbines. They are -- will be subject to Rider recovery. If the turbines demonstrate that they work well in these waters and produce the kind of capacity that we expect, then there's up to 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind that would be available. We're building a lot of solar as well. Our IRP calls for up to 5,000 megawatts of solar. Solar uses a lot of land, and that's beginning to become obvious to people. It's maybe not as quite as obvious to folks in the West where land -- vacant land is abundant. It's a little more obvious to folks in the East where vacant land is not quite as abundant. So we're exploring all of our options to meet our customers' demands for decades to come. That's part of why we're looking at the relicensing of North Anna and Surry as well and pump storage in the Virginia Mountains."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes",759,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes, while the principal negative driver continue to be below-normal weather. In fact, the earnings impact of mild weather during the first half of the year was $0.10 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $422 million for the second quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses.
EBITDA at Power Generation was $554 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were lower operating and maintenance expenses. 
Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA in the upper half of its guidance range at $423 million. Higher transportation and distribution margins were the principal drivers of the strong results. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the results of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $68.6 million, which was 2x the level produced in the second quarter of last year. 
Distributable cash flow of $40.7 million was 70% higher than the level of last year's second quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. 
On July 21, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.288 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. 
Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.24x. 
Moving to treasury activities. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion for the second quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we entered the quarter with available liquidity of $2.7 billion. 
For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 95% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislations in Connecticut. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2017 is expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the third quarter compared to last year include the addition of Questar operations. Negative factors compared to last year include a return to normal weather, lower earnings from Cove Point due to the roll-off of one of our import contracts, higher PJM electric capacity expenses and lower investment tax credits from solar investments. 
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share.
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which will be in service later this year.
With the planned growth across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off our 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate greater than 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion Energy provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry.
So let me summarize my financial review. 
Second quarter operating earnings were $0.67 per share, landing in the upper half of our guidance range. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.15 per share. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017, and our 2017 to 2020 compound earnings growth rate to be 6% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first half of the year. I'm pleased that our employees set at an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year and have a goal of improving on that record this year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the second quarter was over 96%. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of June 30, the $1.3 billion project was 47% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. The air-cooled condenser is over 60% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. Three of these facilities totaling 119 megawatts achieved commercial operations during the second quarter. 
In total, we've announced 438 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina. 
We've begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with costs also recoverable through a Rider. We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. 
In July, we announced that we've signed an agreement with DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 6-megawatt turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy remains the sole owner of the turbines, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek Rider recovery in Virginia for the project. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the first half of the year, $327 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade. 
Our strategic underground program continues at Power Delivery. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which distribution lines would be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events. 
We see improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. Weather-normalized electric sales were up about 2% for the first half of the year, led by strong increases in sales to data center and residential customers. New customer connections in the first half of the year were 7% higher than last year. We also connected 5 new data centers in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 8. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. 
Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 95% complete and remains on time and on budget. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large-diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is essentially complete. Both phases of the operator simulator training have been successfully completed. Synchronization of a steam turbine generator to the existing plant generation grid will be completed this month. Over 90% of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, in line with our schedule.
As we work towards commercial in-service later this year, we will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up this quarter, and construction will reach essentially complete status. 
On July 24, FERC provided authorization for hydrocarbon entry into the 4 additional project areas. We have received authorization from the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. We have an agreement with a third-party to provide the commissioning natural gas and to export commissioning LNG from the facility.   Finally, the fourth quarter will provide a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service date later this year.
We are continuing to work toward commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On July 21, FERC issued its final Environmental Impact Statement. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. We expect to receive the final certificate from FERC in the early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 84% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction later this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 7 pipeline growth projects under way with over $750 million of investment. Our Keys project was completed earlier this year, and we expect 4 more to be completed by year-end. We are also investing nearly $300 million per year in our local gas distribution companies in 3 states through our infrastructure replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 states. 
We're seeing continued interest in expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC loads router system, and expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian Basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is nearly complete and commissioning is well under way. We received a final Environmental Impact Statement and continue to work toward commencement of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. 
As we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings growth starting next year. As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy higher than 8% per year. You can expect more clarity on our long-term growth plan and ongoing dividend policy at this fall's investor conferences. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes",759,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2017, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower operating expenses and income taxes, while the principal negative driver continue to be below-normal weather. In fact, the earnings impact of mild weather during the first half of the year was $0.10 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $422 million for the second quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses.
EBITDA at Power Generation was $554 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were lower operating and maintenance expenses. 
Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA in the upper half of its guidance range at $423 million. Higher transportation and distribution margins were the principal drivers of the strong results. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the results of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $68.6 million, which was 2x the level produced in the second quarter of last year. 
Distributable cash flow of $40.7 million was 70% higher than the level of last year's second quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. 
On July 21, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.288 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. 
Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.24x. 
Moving to treasury activities. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion for the second quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we entered the quarter with available liquidity of $2.7 billion. 
For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 95% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislations in Connecticut. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2017 is expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the third quarter compared to last year include the addition of Questar operations. Negative factors compared to last year include a return to normal weather, lower earnings from Cove Point due to the roll-off of one of our import contracts, higher PJM electric capacity expenses and lower investment tax credits from solar investments. 
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share.
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which will be in service later this year.
With the planned growth across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off our 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate greater than 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion Energy provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry.
So let me summarize my financial review. 
Second quarter operating earnings were $0.67 per share, landing in the upper half of our guidance range. Third quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.15 per share. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017, and our 2017 to 2020 compound earnings growth rate to be 6% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first half of the year. I'm pleased that our employees set at an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year and have a goal of improving on that record this year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the second quarter was over 96%. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of June 30, the $1.3 billion project was 47% complete. All 3 gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All 3 heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. The air-cooled condenser is over 60% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. Three of these facilities totaling 119 megawatts achieved commercial operations during the second quarter. 
In total, we've announced 438 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina. 
We've begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our 4 nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest, with costs also recoverable through a Rider. We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year. 
In July, we announced that we've signed an agreement with DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 6-megawatt turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy remains the sole owner of the turbines, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek Rider recovery in Virginia for the project. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the first half of the year, $327 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade. 
Our strategic underground program continues at Power Delivery. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which distribution lines would be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events. 
We see improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. Weather-normalized electric sales were up about 2% for the first half of the year, led by strong increases in sales to data center and residential customers. New customer connections in the first half of the year were 7% higher than last year. We also connected 5 new data centers in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 8. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. 
Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 95% complete and remains on time and on budget. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large-diameter piping installation are coming to completion, and the post-installation pipe testing is essentially complete. Both phases of the operator simulator training have been successfully completed. Synchronization of a steam turbine generator to the existing plant generation grid will be completed this month. Over 90% of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, in line with our schedule.
As we work towards commercial in-service later this year, we will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up this quarter, and construction will reach essentially complete status. 
On July 24, FERC provided authorization for hydrocarbon entry into the 4 additional project areas. We have received authorization from the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. We have an agreement with a third-party to provide the commissioning natural gas and to export commissioning LNG from the facility.   Finally, the fourth quarter will provide a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service date later this year.
We are continuing to work toward commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On July 21, FERC issued its final Environmental Impact Statement. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts. We expect to receive the final certificate from FERC in the early fall. We are in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract and completed over 84% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction later this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We have an additional 7 pipeline growth projects under way with over $750 million of investment. Our Keys project was completed earlier this year, and we expect 4 more to be completed by year-end. We are also investing nearly $300 million per year in our local gas distribution companies in 3 states through our infrastructure replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 states. 
We're seeing continued interest in expansion projects driven by new power, industrial and LDC loads router system, and expect to secure at least 3 or 4 new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian Basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is nearly complete and commissioning is well under way. We received a final Environmental Impact Statement and continue to work toward commencement of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. 
As we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings growth starting next year. As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy higher than 8% per year. You can expect more clarity on our long-term growth plan and ongoing dividend policy at this fall's investor conferences. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,539607513,1325361,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017. It was in the middle of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and operating expenses. Negative drivers include lower merchant power margins and continued mild weather. In fact, the negative earnings impact of mild weather across our electric and gas operations during the first 3 quarters of the year was $0.12 per share.
GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of our operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $441 million for the third quarter, which is in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of slightly mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses.
EBITDA at Power Generation was $565 million for the third quarter, which was below the middle of its guidance range. [indiscernible] merchant margins were the principal negative driver along with slightly mild weather. Partially offsetting these factors were lower operating and maintenance expenses.
Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA of $471 million for the third quarter, which was near the high end of its guidance range, primarily due to lower operating expenses.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results from all of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.2 million, which was nearly 3 times the level produced in the third quarter of 2016. Distributable cash flow was $45.8 million, 90% higher than the level of last year's third quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase.
On October 24, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3025 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.28x.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $3.7 billion through the third quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we entered the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Earlier this month, the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline closed on a construction financing facility designed to fund roughly half of the cost to construct the pipeline. The first funding of $570 million took place last week to cover a portion of the cost incurred to date.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 98% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production, principally for the first quarter. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of legislation in Connecticut.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.80 and $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive factors compared to last year's fourth quarter, our earnings from our growth projects and the benefit from the recently announced agreement between Dominion products and Homes of USA. Negative factors for the fourth quarter compared to last year included a refueling outage at Millstone, lower import revenues from Cove Point, lower investment tax credits from solar projects and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. We remain confident that our operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over the $3.65 per share midpoint of this year's earnings guidance range, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which will be in service later this year.
We also reiterate our expectations of a 6% to 8% EPS growth rate from 2017 through 2020 and EPS growth of at least 5% per year thereafter.
So let me summarize my financial review. Third quarter operating earnings were $1.04 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite continued mild weather. Fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.80 to $1 per share, and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,539607513,1325361,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety  goals through the first 9 months of the year. I'm pleased that our employees have set an all-time low recordable",1469,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety  goals through the first 9 months of the year. I'm pleased that our employees have set an all-time low recordable rate of 0.66 last year and are on track to improve on that record this year.
Our fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the end of the third quarter was over 96%. Weather normalized electric sales for the first 3 quarters of the year were up 1.7% over the same period last year, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Year-to-date, total new customer connects are in line with our expectations as strong growth in commercial connections have offset slightly lower than expected growth in residential new connects.  Through the third quarter, we have connected 11 new data centers compared to 7 for the first 9 months of last year.
Also during the quarter, our Gas Infrastructure Group executed an amendment to an existing Marcellus farmout agreement, locking in the remaining value under the agreement and securing payments totaling $130 million in 2017 and 2018. You will recall that in 2015 when we began discussing our farmout program, we anticipated generating between $450 million and $500 million in earnings from farmout transactions from 2015 through 2020. We are halfway through that timeline, and despite less than ideal commodity market conditions, we have already achieved nearly 3 quarters of our objective.
Last week, the Connecticut General assembly approved legislation that will our Millstone nuclear power Pratt the non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. On behalf of the 1,500 women and men working at Millstone power station, Dominion Energy thanks the General Assembly for giving Millstone this opportunity. It is grateful for the administration for his work in negotiating the current form of the legislation. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs in Millstone's substantial environmental and economic benefits to Connecticut.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of September 30, the $1.3 billion project was 60% complete. The air cold condenser is over 80% complete, while pipe rack models have been set and pipe welding continues at the steady rate. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter of next year and is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, 6 solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation. For all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced was 457 megawatts that will go on to service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
Earlier this month, we announced we will add solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in central Virginia. Pending state corporation commission approval, this with the new rate options, scheduled RS, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources.
We are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia. A preliminary permit application has been filed with FERC, identifying a potential project in Virginia. We've also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia. It's in the public interest, with cost recoverable through a rate rider. 
In July, we announced that we had signed an agreement with formerly Dong Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 turbines off the course of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering procurement and construction. Dominion Energy will remain the sole owner of the project, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek rider recovery for the project during the first half of next year.
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the end of the third quarter, $419 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 97% complete and remains on time and on budget. Construction is essentially complete. All processes have been turned over for site commissioning, and we have entered the final phase of start up. We have completed the initial operating run on our auxiliary toilets, steam turbine generators, frame 7 EA combustion thermals and numerous motors, pumps and compressors that are part of the liquefaction process. FERC has approved the introduction of all hydrocarbons necessary generate LNG. The operation's formal training is complete. We are fully staffed with trained and qualified operators. We will begin generating LNG next month then conclude commissioning in December and expect to be in service by the end of the year.
We continue to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related supply header project. On October 13, FERC issued its certificate of public convenience and necessity and we filed our acceptance of the certificate the following week. The project has achieved several additional permitting milestones over the last few weeks, including the final biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approval of the Virginia Outdoor Foundation [indiscernible], and approval from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. [indiscernible] supply header completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contracts and completed 90% of materials procurement. We expect to commence construction late this year and to complete both the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We've also made progress on 9 Gas Infrastructure growth projects representing over $1 billion of investment. Three of these projects have been completed this year, and we expect 2 more to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these incremental projects, we plan to invest $325 million to $350 million per year at our 3 gas utilities as part of our ongoing pipeline replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 jurisdictions.
And in September, we announced a long-term investment program to modernized our Dominion Energy transmission pipeline and storage infrastructure. These investments will deliver operating, reliability, security, safety and environmental benefits and are expected to total about $250 million per year. 
To support this investment program, we plan to file a rate case in the first half of next year, the first for this pipeline in over 20 years, in which we will request updated rates and establish a tracker for recovery of the modernization investments. 
Finally, earlier this month, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of 10% above the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase reflects the board's confidence in Dominion Energy's execution of its growth plan and the enhanced cash flows made possible by our master limited partnership. Our plan is to share these benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is essentially complete, and commissioning is well underway to begin service late this year, on time and on budget. We received the FERC certificate for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project and will commence construction soon, and we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. We further expect earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter supported by a diverse set of growth programs. 
Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

The structure is essential is that you jointly market to customers that -- using a joint marketing of Dominion Energy and HomeServe, so it's a pretty common structure. The way the work for us is over time, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, the existing business we have, which only contributes for us about a $0.01 or 2 a year and what's been a very stable good growth business for us, but yet a small level, we will start transitioning that product and service customer base to HomeServe, for them to service and grow from there. That will take some time to do. And from then on, we will get a commission-based fee as they grow that business going forward. They are the major player in this market, and so they were very interested in acquiring our customer base there fore products and services. And it was a good deal for us. But in terms of the earnings component, I'm going to hedge a little bit on that only because it hasn't closed yet, and it will be some movement year to year from this year to next year based on the closing and consent, but it is in our guidance for the fourth quarter and we'll be able to talk more about that because we'll have to close the transaction by the next call."

Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and ope",806,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and operating expenses. Negative drivers include lower merchant power margins and continued mild weather. In fact, the negative earnings impact of mild weather across our electric and gas operations during the first 3 quarters of the year was $0.12 per share.
GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $441 million for the third quarter, which is in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of slightly mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses. EBITDA at Power Generation was $565 million for the third quarter, which was below the middle of its guidance range. Lower PJM merchant margins were the principal negative driver along with slightly mild weather. Partially offsetting these factors were lower operating and maintenance expenses. Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA of $471 million for the third quarter, which was near the high end of its guidance range, primarily due to lower operating expenses. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from all of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.2 million, which was nearly 3 times the level produced in the third quarter of 2016. Distributable cash flow was $45.8 million, 90% higher than the level of last year's third quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase.
On October 24, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3025 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.28x.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $3.7 billion through the third quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and, taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion. For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Earlier this month, the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline closed on a construction financing facility designed to fund roughly half of the cost to construct the pipeline. The first funding of $570 million took place last week to cover a portion of the cost incurred to-date.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 98% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production, principally for the first quarter. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of legislation in Connecticut.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.80 and $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive factors compared to last year's fourth quarter are earnings from our growth projects and the benefit from the recently announced agreement between Dominion Products and Services and HomeServe USA. Negative factors for the fourth quarter compared to last year included a refueling outage at Millstone, lower import revenues from Cove Point, lower investment tax credits from solar projects and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. We remain confident that operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over the $3.65 per share midpoint of this year's earnings guidance range, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility which will be in service later this year. We also reiterate our expectation of a 6% to 8% EPS growth rate from 2017 through 2020 and EPS growth of at least 5% per year thereafter.
So let me summarize my financial review. Third quarter operating earnings were $1.04 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite continued mild weather. Fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.80 to $1 per share and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,539607513,1325516,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion.

Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first 9 months of the year. I'm pleased that our employees have set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year and are on track to improve on that record this year.
Our incoming fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the end of the third quarter was over 96%. Weather-normalized electric sales for the first 3 quarters of the year were up 1.7% over the same period last year, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Year-to-date, total new customer connects are in line with our expectations as strong growth in commercial connections have offset slightly lower than expected growth in residential new connects. Through the third quarter, we have connected 11 new data centers compared to 7 for the first 9 months of last year.
Also during the quarter, our Gas Infrastructure Group executed an amendment to an existing Marcellus farmout agreement, locking in the remaining value under the agreement and securing payments totaling $130 million in 2017 and 2018. You will recall that in 2015 when we began discussing our farmout program, we anticipated generating between $450 million and $500 million in earnings from farmout transactions from 2015 through 2020. We are halfway through that time line and, despite less than ideal commodity market conditions, we have already achieved nearly 3/4 of our objective.
Last week, the Connecticut General Assembly approved legislation that will allow our Millstone nuclear plant the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. On behalf of the 1,500 women and men working at Millstone Power Station, Dominion Energy thanks the General Assembly for giving Millstone this opportunity and is grateful for the Malloy administration for his work in negotiating the current form of a legislation. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits to Connecticut.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of September 30, the $1.3 billion project was 60% complete. The air-cooled condenser is over 80% complete, while pipe rack modules have been set and pipe welding continues at the steady rate. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter of next year and is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, 6 solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation. For all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced 457 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
Earlier this month, we announced we will add solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in Central Virginia. Pending State Corporation Commission approval, this need will be met with a new rate option, Schedule RF, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources.
We are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia. A preliminary permit application has been filed with FERC, identifying a potential project site in Tazewell County, Virginia. We've also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in Wise County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia. It's in the public interest with costs recoverable through a rate rider.
In July, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy will remain the sole owner of the project, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek rider recovery for the project during the first half of next year.
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the end of the third quarter, $419 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 97% complete and remains on time and on budget. Construction is essentially complete. All processes have been turned over for site commissioning and we have entered the final phase of start-up. We have completed the initial operating run on our auxiliary boilers, steam turbine generators, Frame 7EA combustion turbines and numerous motors, pumps and compressors that are part of the liquefaction process. FERC has approved the introduction of all hydrocarbons necessary to generate LNG. The operation's formal training is complete. We are fully staffed with trained and qualified operators. We will begin generating LNG next month then conclude commissioning in December and expect to be in service by the end of the year.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On October 13, FERC issued its certificate of public convenience and necessity and we filed our acceptance of the certificate the following week. The project has achieved several additional permitting milestones over the last few weeks, including the final biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approval of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation easements and approval from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contracts and completed 90% of materials procurement. We expect to commence construction late this year and to complete both the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We've also made progress on 9 Gas Infrastructure growth projects representing over $1 billion of investment. Three of these projects have been completed this year and we expect 2 more to be completed by year-end. In addition to these incremental projects, we plan to invest $325 million to $350 million per year at our 3 gas utilities as part of our ongoing pipeline replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 jurisdictions.
And in September, we announced a long-term investment program to modernize our Dominion Energy transmissions pipeline and storage infrastructure. These investments will deliver operating, reliability, security, safety and environmental benefits and are expected to total about $250 million per year. To support this investment program, we plan to file a rate case in the first half of next year, the first for this pipeline in over 20 years, in which we will request updated rates and establish a tracker for recovery of the modernization investments.
Finally, earlier this month, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of 10% above the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase reflects the board's confidence in Dominion Energy's execution of its growth plan and the enhanced cash flows made possible by our master limited partnership. Our plan is to share these benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is essentially complete and commissioning is well underway to be in service late this year, on time and on budget. We received the FERC certificate for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project and will commence construction soon. And we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. We further expect earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter, supported by a diverse set of growth programs. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

We'll expend CapEx at about -- a little bit over $100 million on it, fully contracted. We look for really good future growth out of the Carolina business.
We also look for very good future growth out of the Questar Pipeline. For this calendar year, most of the growth on Questar that's been executed is really based on synergies of the merger and we've been able to execute that at a very high level. And actually, we'll be able to produce at a higher level for the Questar Pipe than we anticipated earlier in the year for DM.
So again, our goal over time is to get more assets into DM that can grow organically, but quite honestly, for the next 3 years, that will be dwarfed by the Cove Point drop-down."

And the structure essentially is that you jointly market to customers that -- using a joint marketing of Dominion Energy and HomeServe. So it's a pretty common structure.
The way it will work for us is, over time, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, the existing business we have, which only contributes for us about a $0.01 or $0.02 a year and what's been a very stable good growth business for us but yet a small level, we will start transitioning that Product and Service customer base to HomeServe for them to service and grow from there. That will take some time to do. And from then on, we will get a commission-based fee as they grow that business going forward. They are the major player in this market and so they were very interested in acquiring our customer base there for Products and Services and it was a good deal for us.

Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and ope",806,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and operating expenses. Negative drivers include lower merchant power margins and continued mild weather. In fact, the negative earnings impact of mild weather across our electric and gas operations during the first 3 quarters of the year was $0.12 per share.
GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $441 million for the third quarter, which is in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of slightly mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses. EBITDA at Power Generation was $565 million for the third quarter, which was below the middle of its guidance range. Lower PJM merchant margins were the principal negative driver along with slightly mild weather. Partially offsetting these factors were lower operating and maintenance expenses. Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA of $471 million for the third quarter, which was near the high end of its guidance range, primarily due to lower operating expenses. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from all of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.2 million, which was nearly 3 times the level produced in the third quarter of 2016. Distributable cash flow was $45.8 million, 90% higher than the level of last year's third quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase.
On October 24, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3025 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.28x.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $3.7 billion through the third quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and, taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion. For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Earlier this month, the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline closed on a construction financing facility designed to fund roughly half of the cost to construct the pipeline. The first funding of $570 million took place last week to cover a portion of the cost incurred to-date.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 98% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production, principally for the first quarter. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of legislation in Connecticut.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.80 and $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive factors compared to last year's fourth quarter are earnings from our growth projects and the benefit from the recently announced agreement between Dominion Products and Services and HomeServe USA. Negative factors for the fourth quarter compared to last year included a refueling outage at Millstone, lower import revenues from Cove Point, lower investment tax credits from solar projects and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. We remain confident that operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over the $3.65 per share midpoint of this year's earnings guidance range, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility which will be in service later this year. We also reiterate our expectation of a 6% to 8% EPS growth rate from 2017 through 2020 and EPS growth of at least 5% per year thereafter.
So let me summarize my financial review. Third quarter operating earnings were $1.04 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite continued mild weather. Fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.80 to $1 per share and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first 9 months of the year. I'm pleased that our employees have set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year and are on track to improve on that record this year.
Our incoming fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the end of the third quarter was over 96%. Weather-normalized electric sales for the first 3 quarters of the year were up 1.7% over the same period last year, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Year-to-date, total new customer connects are in line with our expectations as strong growth in commercial connections have offset slightly lower than expected growth in residential new connects. Through the third quarter, we have connected 11 new data centers compared to 7 for the first 9 months of last year.
Also during the quarter, our Gas Infrastructure Group executed an amendment to an existing Marcellus farmout agreement, locking in the remaining value under the agreement and securing payments totaling $130 million in 2017 and 2018. You will recall that in 2015 when we began discussing our farmout program, we anticipated generating between $450 million and $500 million in earnings from farmout transactions from 2015 through 2020. We are halfway through that time line and, despite less than ideal commodity market conditions, we have already achieved nearly 3/4 of our objective.
Last week, the Connecticut General Assembly approved legislation that will allow our Millstone nuclear plant the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. On behalf of the 1,500 women and men working at Millstone Power Station, Dominion Energy thanks the General Assembly for giving Millstone this opportunity and is grateful for the Malloy administration for his work in negotiating the current form of the legislation. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits to Connecticut.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of September 30, the $1.3 billion project was 60% complete. The air-cooled condenser is over 80% complete, while pipe rack modules have been set and pipe welding continues at a steady rate. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter of next year and is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, 6 solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation. For all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced 457 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
Earlier this month, we announced we will add solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in Central Virginia. Pending State Corporation Commission approval, this need will be met with a new rate option, Schedule RF, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources.
We are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia. A preliminary permit application has been filed with FERC, identifying a potential project site in Tazewell County, Virginia. We've also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in Wise County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia. It's in the public interest with costs recoverable through a rate rider.
In July, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy will remain the sole owner of the project, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek rider recovery for the project during the first half of next year.
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the end of the third quarter, $419 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 97% complete and remains on time and on budget. Construction is essentially complete. All processes have been turned over for site commissioning and we have entered the final phase of start-up. We have completed the initial operating run on our auxiliary boilers, steam turbine generators, Frame 7EA combustion turbines and numerous motors, pumps and compressors that are part of the liquefaction process. FERC has approved the introduction of all hydrocarbons necessary to generate LNG. The operation's formal training is complete. We are fully staffed with trained and qualified operators. We will begin generating LNG next month then conclude commissioning in December and expect to be in service by the end of the year.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On October 13, FERC issued its certificate of public convenience and necessity and we filed our acceptance of the certificate the following week. The project has achieved several additional permitting milestones over the last few weeks, including the final biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approval of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation easements and approval from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contracts and completed 90% of materials procurement. We expect to commence construction late this year and to complete both the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We've also made progress on 9 Gas Infrastructure growth projects representing over $1 billion of investment. Three of these projects have been completed this year and we expect 2 more to be completed by year-end. In addition to these incremental projects, we plan to invest $325 million to $350 million per year at our 3 gas utilities as part of our ongoing pipeline replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 jurisdictions.
And in September, we announced a long-term investment program to modernize our Dominion Energy transmissions pipeline and storage infrastructure. These investments will deliver operating, reliability, security, safety and environmental benefits and are expected to total about $250 million per year. To support this investment program, we plan to file a rate case in the first half of next year, the first for this pipeline in over 20 years, in which we will request updated rates and establish a tracker for recovery of the modernization investments.
Finally, earlier this month, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of 10% above the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase reflects the board's confidence in Dominion Energy's execution of its growth plan and the enhanced cash flows made possible by our master limited partnership. Our plan is to share these benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is essentially complete and commissioning is well underway to be in service late this year, on time and on budget. We received the FERC certificate for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project and will commence construction soon. And we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. We further expect earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter, supported by a diverse set of growth programs. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020.

And actually, we'll be able to produce at a higher level for the Questar Pipe than we anticipated earlier in the year for DM.

The way it will work for us is, over time, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, the existing business we have, which only contributes for us about a $0.01 or $0.02 a year and what's been a very stable good growth business for us but yet a small level, we will start transitioning that Product and Service customer base to HomeServe for them to service and grow from there. That will take some time to do. And from then on, we will get a commission-based fee as they grow that business going forward.

Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and ope",806,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes and operating expenses. Negative drivers include lower merchant power margins and continued mild weather. In fact, the negative earnings impact of mild weather across our electric and gas operations during the first 3 quarters of the year was $0.12 per share.
GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $441 million for the third quarter, which is in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of slightly mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses. EBITDA at Power Generation was $565 million for the third quarter, which was below the middle of its guidance range. Lower PJM merchant margins were the principal negative driver along with slightly mild weather. Partially offsetting these factors were lower operating and maintenance expenses. Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA of $471 million for the third quarter, which was near the high end of its guidance range, primarily due to lower operating expenses. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from all of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.2 million, which was nearly 3 times the level produced in the third quarter of 2016. Distributable cash flow was $45.8 million, 90% higher than the level of last year's third quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase.
On October 24, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3025 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.28x.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $3.7 billion through the third quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and, taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion. For the status of our 2017 financings, please see Slide 7. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Earlier this month, the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline closed on a construction financing facility designed to fund roughly half of the cost to construct the pipeline. The first funding of $570 million took place last week to cover a portion of the cost incurred to-date.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 98% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and have started hedging 2018 production, principally for the first quarter. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of legislation in Connecticut.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.80 and $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive factors compared to last year's fourth quarter are earnings from our growth projects and the benefit from the recently announced agreement between Dominion Products and Services and HomeServe USA. Negative factors for the fourth quarter compared to last year included a refueling outage at Millstone, lower import revenues from Cove Point, lower investment tax credits from solar projects and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.
Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. We remain confident that operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over the $3.65 per share midpoint of this year's earnings guidance range, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility which will be in service later this year. We also reiterate our expectation of a 6% to 8% EPS growth rate from 2017 through 2020 and EPS growth of at least 5% per year thereafter.
So let me summarize my financial review. Third quarter operating earnings were $1.04 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite continued mild weather. Fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.80 to $1 per share and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our incoming fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units through the end of the third quarter was over 96%. Weather-normalized electric sales for the first 3 quarters of the year were up 1.7% over the same period last year, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Year-to-date, total new customer connects are in line with our expectations as strong growth in commercial connections have offset slightly lower than expected growth in residential new connects. Through the third quarter, we have connected 11 new data centers compared to 7 for the first 9 months of last year.
Also during the quarter, our Gas Infrastructure Group executed an amendment to an existing Marcellus farmout agreement, locking in the remaining value under the agreement and securing payments totaling $130 million in 2017 and 2018. You will recall that in 2015 when we began discussing our farmout program, we anticipated generating between $450 million and $500 million in earnings from farmout transactions from 2015 through 2020. We are halfway through that time line and, despite less than ideal commodity market conditions, we have already achieved nearly 3/4 of our objective.
Last week, the Connecticut General Assembly approved legislation that will allow our Millstone nuclear plant the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. On behalf of the 1,500 women and men working at Millstone Power Station, Dominion Energy thanks the General Assembly for giving Millstone this opportunity and is grateful for the Malloy administration for his work in negotiating the current form of the legislation. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits to Connecticut.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of September 30, the $1.3 billion project was 60% complete. The air-cooled condenser is over 80% complete, while pipe rack modules have been set and pipe welding continues at a steady rate. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter of next year and is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
We have a number of solar projects under development and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, 6 solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation. For all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced 457 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina.
Earlier this month, we announced we will add solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in Central Virginia. Pending State Corporation Commission approval, this need will be met with a new rate option, Schedule RF, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources.
We are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia. A preliminary permit application has been filed with FERC, identifying a potential project site in Tazewell County, Virginia. We've also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in Wise County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating the construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia. It's in the public interest with costs recoverable through a rate rider.
In July, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build 2 turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The 2 companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement and construction. Dominion Energy will remain the sole owner of the project, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek rider recovery for the project during the first half of next year.
We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the end of the third quarter, $419 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 97% complete and remains on time and on budget. Construction is essentially complete. All processes have been turned over for site commissioning and we have entered the final phase of start-up. We have completed the initial operating run on our auxiliary boilers, steam turbine generators, Frame 7EA combustion turbines and numerous motors, pumps and compressors that are part of the liquefaction process. FERC has approved the introduction of all hydrocarbons necessary to generate LNG. The operation's formal training is complete. We are fully staffed with trained and qualified operators. We will begin generating LNG next month then conclude commissioning in December and expect to be in service by the end of the year.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On October 13, FERC issued its certificate of public convenience and necessity and we filed our acceptance of the certificate the following week. The project has achieved several additional permitting milestones over the last few weeks, including the final biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approval of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation easements and approval from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contracts and completed 90% of materials procurement. We expect to commence construction late this year and to complete both the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
We've also made progress on 9 Gas Infrastructure growth projects representing over $1 billion of investment. Three of these projects have been completed this year and we expect 2 more to be completed by year-end. In addition to these incremental projects, we plan to invest $325 million to $350 million per year at our 3 gas utilities as part of our ongoing pipeline replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all 3 jurisdictions.
And in September, we announced a long-term investment program to modernize our Dominion Energy transmissions pipeline and storage infrastructure. These investments will deliver operating, reliability, security, safety and environmental benefits and are expected to total about $250 million per year. To support this investment program, we plan to file a rate case in the first half of next year, the first for this pipeline in over 20 years, in which we will request updated rates and establish a tracker for recovery of the modernization investments.
Finally, earlier this month, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of 10% above the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase reflects the board's confidence in Dominion Energy's execution of its growth plan and the enhanced cash flows made possible by our master limited partnership. Our plan is to share these benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is essentially complete and commissioning is well underway to be in service late this year, on time and on budget. We received the FERC certificate for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project and will commence construction soon. And we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. We further expect earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter, supported by a diverse set of growth programs. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

I think it's probably a fair assumption to say that the Power Delivery and Gas Infrastructure parts of that are pretty visible and pretty stable for the most part and that the Power Generation would be the lumpier part of it. Is that fair? And can you give us more detail on timing?"

And I would -- if I had to model it right now because I know we have -- we always have more exposure on this, but if I would model it, I would just model it evenly over the 3 years. It would be pretty consistent, I think, and be pretty consistent by business line. We're also have highlighted a project on the pump storage side that we'll also be expending CapEx on in that period of time as well as well into the next decade. And potentially, offshore wind, certainly a smaller project with 2 turbines. So we've highlighted that we'll be going through the approval process and we've highlighted some dollar figures around that. So we've given quite a bit of disclosure, but we'll need to get a little more granularity, I think, by business line as we move into '18, '19 and '20."
