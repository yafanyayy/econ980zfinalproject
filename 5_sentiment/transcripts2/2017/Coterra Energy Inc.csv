With me today, I do have the member of Cabot's -- members of the Cabot's executive team.In today's call, I will be referr",2672,"Thank you, Anita, and good morning all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. With me today, I do have the member of Cabot's -- members of the Cabot's executive team.
In today's call, I will be referring to slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for 2016 as well as our plans for 2017. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses about forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and the this.
Now we'll move to the 2016 highlights on Slide 3. '16 was another positive year for Cabot Oil & Gas, especially in light of the lower commodity price backdrop we navigated through for a significant portion of the year. Our plan for the year was to deliver returns-focused production and reserve growth to invest capital prudently while targeting a free cash flow positive investment program and to continue to improve on our top-tier cost structure and to maintain strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident to say that we executed across the board on all these goals. 
Cabot grew production and proved reserve by 4% and 5%, respectively, from a capital program that was over 50% lower than 2015. Despite lower realized commodity prices for the year, which resulted in Cabot's lowest realized natural gas price in its history, we were able to deliver our production and reserve growth while generating positive free cash flow. That is quite an accomplishment. 
Our continued emphasis on cost control was demonstrated by our record low all source binding cost of $0.37 per Mcfe and our 11% year-over-year reduction in cash operating expense per unit. A significant portion of the reduction in our cost structure was driven by internally sourced operating efficiency gains that will remain in place, regardless of changes in service cost environment. 
The balance sheet remains strong with approximately $500 million of cash on hand and approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility. During the year, we reduced our debt outstanding by almost $500 million by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuance in early 2016, resulting in a significant reduction in leverage metrics throughout the year.
On the operational front, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR to 4.4 Bcf per thousand foot lateral, improving our peer-leading e6 in Appalachia. I plan to discuss our updated Marcellus EUR further in the call.
Now let's move to Slide 4 where we have highlighted our production and reserve growth over the last few years. You can see that we have averaged a 15% and 16% compounded annual growth rate for production reserves, respectively, over the last 3 years. While our 2017 production growth guidance of 5% to 10% is slightly below our historic growth rate, as we wait new takeaway capacity in the Marcellus, we are forecasting our discretionary cash flow to double this year based on recent strip prices, which is driven by significant improvement in cash margins due to higher realized prices and lower operating costs. We do expect a return to growth levels above this historic CAGR in 2018 as new infrastructure is in place throughout Appalachia. While we have not officially guided to 19 production levels, our internal forecast shows an even more robust level of growth in 2019.
On the reserve front, I would emphasize that our proved developed growth has outpaced our total reserve growth, highlighting that our growth is coming through the drill bit and is not a function of adding excessive levels of proved, undeveloped reserves. 
Now I'll flip to 5 -- slide 5 through 7, kind of cover all those at one comment. They highlight the continued improvement we have seen in our drilling, completion and operating costs over the last 3 years. The cost reductions our operating teams have achieved in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which are represented on Slide 5, have translated into significant improvements and our finding costs and our cash operating costs is highlighted on slides 6 and 7, respectively. 
On Slide 8 illustrates our capital budget and operating program for 2017. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have increased our total program spending for the year from $625 million to $720 million, which includes an $85 million increase for additional Eagle Ford activity to capitalize on the higher prices and most importantly, improve well productivity; a $20 million increase in equity pipeline investments, driven by a more favorable outlook on the construction timing for Atlantic Sunrise; and a $15 million increase in the Marcellus, primarily for additional drilling activity, driven by faster drilling times. These increases in capital are offset by approximately $25 million of savings from additional Marcellus drilling efficiencies.
We plan to spend $610 million of drilling completion and facility capital in 2017, of which 67% will go to the Marcellus and 33% will go to the Eagle Ford. This will fund the drilling and completion of approximately 90 net wells. We plan to exit 2017 with 45 DUCs, of which 35 are located in the Marcellus, positioning us well for accelerating production growth in 2018 upon the in-service of new takeaway capacity. 
Moving to Slide 9, which contains a reconciliation of the updated capital budget to the preliminary budget we discussed on the third quarter conference call, referencing the previously mentioned changes in the capital -- in capital for the year. I would also highlight that despite this increase in capital spending, we are currently forecasting approximately $250 million of positive free cash flow for the year based on recent strip prices. Additionally, while our production growth guidance of 5% to 10% remains unchanged, our year-over-year all [ph] growth guidance of 15% is substantially higher than the 0% oil growth contained in our original budget. This increased oil growth moves us higher in our production guidance range and allows for more flexibility around curtailments in the Marcellus during the year, if warranted. However, based on current price expectations, we do not expect [indiscernible] to be a concern.
Moving on to the Eagle Ford operation, Slide 10. During the second half of last year, we began testing new completion designs in the Eagle Ford to determine the impact of increased profit loading, tighter cluster spacing, diversion technology. Wells on this slide do a great job highlighting the productivity gains we are seeing from our enhanced completions. The results from a 3-well pad that was completed last year are significantly outperforming the results from an offset pad that was completed with an older completion design. Additionally, you can see that well 1, which was recently completed with 1,800 pounds of profit per foot, is outperforming the other 2 wells from the same pad that were completed with slightly less problem. While the production history is still very limited, we are encouraged by the result and plan to implement enhanced completions throughout our program this year.
On the left slide of Slide 11, we highlight the impact of our enhanced completions on our Eagle Ford returns. At today's well costs, our average 9,000-foot lateral generates a rate of return over 60% at a $50 per barrel realized price, which is about what we are realizing currently. Like all of our industry peers, we anticipate some level of cost inflation this year and are budgeting this inflation into our well costs for the second half of the year. You can see that even when assuming this inflationary pressure on well costs, our returns are still above 45%. Based on the improved economics and the expectation of higher oil prices later in 2017, we have increased our spending in the Eagle Ford to help pivot this asset back into growth mode as opposed to holding pattern that has been in, in the last couple of years. Accordingly, we anticipate growing our exit poll volumes this year by 50% as opposed to the 5% we forecasted in the original budget.
Heading over to Marcellus and turning to Slide 12. We have plotted the average cumulative production results for our GEN 4 completions compared to our prior tight curves of 3.8 Bcf per thousand feet and our new type curve of 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet. While our sample size is still limited with only 21 wells based on production data we have to date and the fact that these 21 wells were drilled in the North, South, East and West, we are very confident that these results are repeatable across the field. While it's very well understood across industry and investment community that Cabot's wells in Northeast Pennsylvania are some of the best wells in the country, Slide 13 illustrates how our EUR stacks up against other natural gas operating areas across the U.S. In fact, our 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet is double that of some of our peers who have been doubting [ph] their technical expertise on the completion front, we continue to be impressed with the improvements in well productivity we see year after year and are in the process of testing other enhancements to our well design to further improve our economics.
Slide 14 demonstrates how our increasing EURs, our improvements in well costs and better realized pricing are impacting our economics. We originally budgeted $7.9 million for our 8,000-foot lateral GEN 4 well costs back in October of last year. However, we are currently averaging about 10% lower due to improved operating efficiencies. Approximately 75% of our costs are locked in under term contracts, so we are anticipating only a slight increase in well costs by year-end. With this anticipated well costs, our rates of return at the current Leidy strip meet or exceed any return we have seen across the industry.
Moving on to marketing and infrastructure. Slide 15 shows Cabot's monthly realized natural gas prices before hedges, highlighting the significant improvement we have seen in pricing as we enter the winter heating season. While fourth quarter pricing was greatly improved relative to the first 3 quarters of last year, the first quarter '17 has been even better, driven by strong January and February. While strip has pulled back as of late due to unfavorable weather forecast, we're still forecasting a substantial improvement in year-over-year realized prices, driven by higher NYMEX prices, tighter basin differentials and a strong portfolio of fixed price contracts, primarily for the summer season.
As the title of Slide 16 indicates, '18 will be an inflection year for Cabot, both in terms of infrastructure additions and for our growth story.
Moving to the left -- moving from the left to the right of the slide Orion, Moxie and Lackawanna all remain on schedule. Orion received FERC certificate on February 2 and is expected to begin construction this summer. Our 2 power plant projects are currently under construction and on track for an in-service date listed on the slide. As you're aware, Atlantic Sunrise has reached several milestones since we last spoke, receiving the FERC -- or the final environmental impact statement on December 30, 2016, and the FERC certificate approving the project on February 3. The next steps for Atlantic Sunrise, including finishing up permit work with the Pennsylvania DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and receiving the FERC notice and we need to receive the FERC notice to proceed with construction.
We expect all final approvals to be received by mid-summer and construction to begin shortly afterwards, and the in-service date remains mid-2018. Based on the recent progress that was made on these projects, we remain extremely confident in delivering on our production targets for 2018.
The PennEast project continues to make progress and is expected to receive its final environmental impact statement in April, while Constitution Pipeline is still awaiting an answer from the second Court of Appeals for permission to move forward. We expect news regarding constitution status later in the second quarter.
As the slide illustrates, upon in-service of all these projects, Cabot will have the ability to double production volumes from its 2016 exit rate. As we have communicated in the past, the pace at which we fill this capacity with incremental growth volumes will ultimately be dependent upon the market environment. I would also highlight that our marketing team continues to identify new opportunities to increase Cabot's growth trajectory out of Marcellus is evidence through addition of a new 3-year sales contract of 150 million per day on Atlantic Sunrise that was announced at the end of last year.
Now we'll move on to Slide 17, which highlights the anticipated improvement in our realized pricing upon completion of the previously mentioned projects. We expect our overall realizations to improve for our 2 primary reasons: First, the volumes that are shipped on these new projects are expected to receive favorable pricing in the new markets that we are accessing. Second, we anticipate our volumes that remain in the local market will see an improvement in realized prices as a result of tightening of in-basin differentials from the addition of new large-scale projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast and an increase in local demand from the addition of numerous new power plants in the Northeast operating area. Local demand could increase in excess of over 1 Bcf per day beginning as early as January 19 from power plant generation alone. I would also like to highlight that while our forecast the differentials improved significantly between '17 and '18 without adding material amounts of transportation expense, our differentials are expected to improve even further in 2019 as we will receive the full year impact of the projects that were placed in service intermittently throughout 2018. Not to mention if Constitution is placed in service in 2018 or early 2019, that will have an even further positive impact on pricing as those volumes will reach favorable markets in the Northeast.
On another takeaway from this slide that I would like to add is that for 2017, 36% of our volumes are locked in under fixed price contracts at a weighted average price of $2.29 per Mcf, which implies a rate of return greater than 150% for our typical Marcellus well. These volumes would typically be exposed to the local Northeast Pennsylvania indices that average about $1.30 in 2016, so we're very pleased with this portfolio fixed-price contracts.
Finally, on Slide 18. We have attempted to address the most commonly asked question to get -- we get from our shareholders, and that is what are you going to do with all the free cash flow you expect to generate?"" I would first highlight that this is certainly a high-class problem to have and most companies would be envious of our position. We have said time and time again that we believe we can ultimately generate the most shareholder value by delivering returns-focused production and reserve growth and our current organic 5-year plan delivers on this strategy.
With that being said, we will continue to evaluate new opportunities, both internal and external, to identify new platforms for future growth that compete for capital internally and provide competitive full cycle economics. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate returning incremental cash to the shareholder, most likely through increased dividend and potentially reduce our debt levels over time as maturities come due. With the organic growth program we have teed up, you can rest assure that we will remain as disciplined with our capital as our track record has demonstrated and only look to invest capital if we believe it will create long-term value for our shareholder.
So with that, Anita, we will go ahead and open the call up for questions."

I don't put much weight on the capture of that opportunity simply because there's not a great deal of acreage that would fit our model. In looking at other growth areas though, and I can flip it to Jeff, but we do continue to look for the opportunities to expand our growth profile through arrangements that would allow either additional firm in places or in basin projects to remove some of the gaps from the basin and get to a different price points.

Just the tweaking that we've done and we are already staged on what we think we might be able to try to do in the Eagle Ford, but we did see significant increase that we felt warranted with the increase. We felt it warranted the additional capital and to grow that liquids volume as we have now planned on with our 2017 program. So we're very pleased with what we've seen on what we've been able to get out of that Eagle Ford right now. Steve?"

And does it take a great deal of capital to be able to drill a number of wells, complete the number of zones that we need to increase our production and additional Bcf a day? Rather unique in industry to be able to say that. But the production volumes and our forecasts generate so much free cash that there's not that opportunity to -- because of the low capital intensity, there's not an opportunity to redeploy it all into the Marcellus. I can sure you every Mcf that we can put in the pipeline up in Marcellus, we're going to do that and we'll have ample times to be able to fulfill that objective.

With me today, I do have the member of Cabot's -- members of the Cabot's executive team. On today's call, I would all be referring to slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for 2016 as well as our plans for 2017. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses about forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Now we'll move to the 2016 highlights on Slide 3. '16 was another positive year for Cabot Oil & Gas, especially in light of the lower commodity price backdrop we navigated through for a significant portion of the year. Our plan for the year was to deliver returns-focused production and reserve growth, to invest capital prudently while targeting a free cash flow positive investment program, and to continue to improve on our top-tier cost structure and to maintain strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident to say that we executed across the board on all these goals. 
Cabot grew production and proved reserve by 4% and 5%, respectively, from a capital program that was over 50% lower than 2015. Despite lower realized commodity prices for the year, which resulted in Cabot's lowest realized natural gas price in its history, we were able to deliver our production and reserve growth while generating positive free cash flow. That is quite an accomplishment. 
Our continued emphasis on cost control was demonstrated by our record-low all-source finding cost of $0.37 per Mcfe and our 11% year-over-year reduction in cash operating expense per unit. A significant portion of the reduction in our cost structure was driven by internally sourced operating efficiency gains that will remain in place, regardless of changes in the service cost environment. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $500 million of cash on hand and approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility. During the year, we reduced our debt outstanding by almost $500 million by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuance in early 2016, resulting in a significant reduction in leverage metrics throughout the year.
On the operational front, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR to 4.4 Bcf per thousand foot lateral, improving our peer-leading EUR in Appalachia. I plan to discuss our updated Marcellus EUR further in the call.
Now let's move to Slide 4, where we have highlighted our production and reserve growth over the last few years. You can see that we have averaged a 15% and 16% compounded annual growth rate for production reserves, respectively, over the last 3 years. While our 2017 production growth guidance of 5% to 10% is slightly below our historic growth rate, as we wait new takeaway capacity in the Marcellus, we are forecasting our discretionary cash flow to double this year based on recent strip prices, which is driven by significant improvement in cash margins due to higher realized prices and lower operating cost. We do expect a return-to-growth levels above this historic CAGR in 2018 as new infrastructure is in place throughout Appalachia. While we have not officially guided to '19 production levels, our internal forecast shows an even more robust level of growth in 2019. On the reserve front, I would emphasize that our proved developed growth has outpaced our total reserve growth, highlighting that our growth is coming through the drill bit and is not a function of adding excessive levels of proved, undeveloped reserves. 
Now I'll flip to Slide 5 through 7, kind of cover all those at one comment. They highlight the continued improvement we have seen in our drilling, completion and operating cost over the last 3 years. The cost reductions our operating team have achieved in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which are represented on Slide 5, have translated into significant improvements in our finding costs and our cash operating costs, as highlighted on Slides 6 and 7, respectively. 
On Slide 8 illustrates our capital budget and operating program for 2017. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have increased our total program spending for the year from $625 million to $720 million, which includes an $85 million increase for additional Eagle Ford activity to capitalize on the higher prices and, most importantly, improved well productivity; a $20 million increase in equity pipeline investments, driven by a more favorable outlook on the construction timing for Atlantic Sunrise; and a $15 million increase in the Marcellus, primarily for additional drilling activity, driven by faster drilling times. These increases in capital are offset by approximately $25 million of savings from additional Marcellus drilling efficiencies.
We plan to spend $610 million of drilling, completion and facility capital in 2017, of which 67% will go to the Marcellus and 33% will go to the Eagle Ford. This will fund the drilling and completion of approximately 90 net wells. We plan to exit 2017 with 45 DUCs, of which 35 are located in the Marcellus, positioning us well for accelerating production growth in 2018 upon the in-service of new takeaway capacity. 
Moving to Slide 9, which contains a reconciliation of the updated capital budget to the preliminary budget we discussed on the third quarter conference call, referencing the previously mentioned changes in the capital -- in capital for the year. I would also highlight that despite this increase in capital spending, we are currently forecasting approximately $250 million of positive free cash flow for the year based on recent strip prices. Additionally, while our production growth guidance of 5% to 10% remains unchanged, our year-over-year oil growth guidance of 15% is substantially higher than the 0% oil growth contained in our original budget. This increased oil growth moves us higher in our production guidance range and allows for more flexibility around curtailments in the Marcellus during the year, if warranted. However, based on current price expectations, we do not expect curtailments to be a concern.
Moving on to the Eagle Ford operation, Slide 10. During the second half of last year, we began testing new completion designs in the Eagle Ford to determine the impact of increased proppant loading, tighter cluster spacing, diversion technology. Wells on this slide do a great job highlighting the productivity gains we are seeing from our enhanced completions. The results from a 3-well pad that was completed last year are significantly outperforming the results from an offset pad that was completed with an older completion design. Additionally, you can see that well 1, which was recently completed with 1,800 pounds of proppant per foot, is outperforming the other 2 wells from the same pad that were completed with slightly less proppant. While the production history is still very limited, we are encouraged by the result and plan to implement enhanced completions throughout our program this year.
On the left side of Slide 11, we highlight the impact of our enhanced completions on our Eagle Ford returns. At today's well costs, our average 9,000-foot lateral generates a rate of return over 60% at a $50 per barrel realized price, which is about what we are realizing currently. Like all of our industry peers, we anticipate some level of cost inflation this year and are budgeting this inflation into our well costs for the second half of the year. You can see that even when assuming this inflationary pressure on well costs, our returns are still above 45%. Based on the improved economics and the expectation of higher oil prices later in 2017, we have increased our spending in the Eagle Ford to help pivot this asset back into growth mode as opposed to holding pattern that it's been in, in the last couple of years. Accordingly, we anticipate growing our exit oil volumes this year by 50% as opposed to the 5% we forecasted in the original budget.
Heading over to Marcellus and turning to Slide 12. We have plotted the average cumulative production results for our Gen 4 completions compared to our prior type curves of 3.8 Bcf per thousand feet and our new type curve of 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet. While our sample size is still limited with only 21 wells based on production data we have to date and the fact that these 21 wells were drilled in the north, south, east and west, we are very confident that these results are repeatable across the field. 
While it's very well understood across the industry and investment community that Cabot's wells in Northeast Pennsylvania are some of the best wells in the country, Slide 13 illustrates how our EUR stacks up against other natural gas operating areas across the U.S. In fact, our 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet is double that of some of our peers who have been touting their technical expertise on the completion front. We continue to be impressed with the improvements in well productivity we see year after year and are in the process of testing other enhancements to our well design to further improve our economics.
Slide 14 demonstrates how our increasing EURs, our improvement in well costs and better-realized pricing are impacting our economics. We originally budgeted $7.9 million for our 8,000-foot lateral Gen 4 well cost back in October of last year. However, we are currently averaging about 10% lower due to improved operating efficiencies. Approximately 75% of our costs are locked in under term contracts, so we are anticipating only a slight increase in well cost by year-end. With this anticipated well cost, our rates of return at the current Leidy strip meet or exceed any return we have seen across the industry.
Moving on to marketing and infrastructure. Slide 15 shows Cabot's monthly realized natural gas prices before hedges, highlighting the significant improvement we have seen in pricing as we enter the winter heating season. While fourth quarter pricing was greatly improved relative to the first 3 quarters last year, the first quarter of '17 has been even better, driven by strong January and February. While the strip has pulled back as of late due to unfavorable weather forecast, we're still forecasting a substantial improvement in year-over-year realized prices, driven by higher NYMEX prices, tighter basin differentials and a strong portfolio of fixed price contracts, primarily for the summer season.
As the title of Slide 16 indicates, '18 will be an inflection year for Cabot, both in terms of infrastructure additions and for our growth story. Moving to the left -- moving from the left to the right of the slide, Orion, Moxie and Lackawanna all remain on schedule. Orion received the FERC certificate on February 2 and is expected to begin construction this summer. Our 2 power plant projects are currently under construction and on track for an in-service date listed on the slide. 
As you're aware, Atlantic Sunrise has reached several milestones since we last spoke, receiving the FERC -- or the final Environmental Impact Statement on December 30, 2016, and the FERC certificate approving the project on February 3. The next steps for Atlantic Sunrise, including finishing up permit work with the Pennsylvania DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and receiving the FERC notice. And we need to receive the FERC notice to proceed with construction.
We expect all final approvals to be received by mid-summer and construction to begin shortly afterwards, and the in-service date remains mid-2018. Based on the recent progress that was made on these projects, we remain extremely confident in delivering on our production targets for 2018.
The PennEast project continues to make progress and is expected to receive its final Environmental Impact Statement in April, while Constitution Pipeline is still awaiting an answer from the Second Court of Appeals for permission to move forward. We expect news regarding Constitution status later in the second quarter.
As the slide illustrates, upon in-service of all these projects, Cabot will have the ability to double production volumes from its 2016 exit rate. As we have communicated in the past, the pace at which we fill this capacity with incremental growth volumes will ultimately be dependent upon the market environment. I would also highlight that our marketing team continues to identify new opportunities to increase Cabot's growth trajectory out of Marcellus as evidence through addition of a new 3-year sales contract of 150 million per day on Atlantic Sunrise that was announced at the end of last year.
Now we'll move on to Slide 17, which highlights the anticipated improvement in our realized pricing upon completion of the previously mentioned projects. We expect our overall realizations to improve for 2 primary reasons: First, the volumes that are shipped on these new projects are expected to receive favorable pricing in the new markets that we are accessing. Second, we anticipate our volumes that remain in the local market will see an improvement in realized prices as a result of tightening of in-basin differentials from the addition of new large-scale projects, like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast, and an increase in local demand from the addition of numerous new power plants in the Northeast operating area. Local demand could increase in excess of over 1 Bcf per day beginning as early as January 19 from power plant generation alone. I would also like to highlight that while our forecasted differentials improved significantly between '17 and '18 without adding material amounts of transportation expense, our differentials are expected to improve even further in 2019 as we will receive the full year impact of the projects that were placed in-service intermittently throughout 2018. Not to mention if Constitution is placed in-service in 2018 or early 2019, that will have an even further positive impact on pricing as those volumes will reach favorable markets in the Northeast.
On another takeaway from this slide that I would like to add is that for 2017, 36% of our volumes are locked in under fixed price contracts at a weighted average price of $2.29 per Mcf, which implies a rate of return greater than 150% for our typical Marcellus well. These volumes would typically be exposed to the local Northeast Pennsylvania indices that averaged about $1.30 in 2016, so we're very pleased with this portfolio of fixed-price contracts.
Finally, on Slide 18. We have attempted to address the most commonly asked question to get -- we get from our shareholders, and that is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow you expect to generate? I would first highlight that this is certainly a high-class problem to have, and most companies would be envious of our position. We have said time and time again that we believe we can ultimately generate the most shareholder value by delivering returns-focused production and reserve growth, and our current, organic 5-year plan delivers on this strategy.
With that being said, we will continue to evaluate new opportunities, both internal and external, to identify new platforms for future growth that compete for capital internally and provide competitive full-cycle economics. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate returning incremental cash to the shareholder, most likely through increased dividend, and potentially reduce our debt levels over time as maturities come due. With the organic growth program we have teed up, you can rest assure that we will remain as disciplined with our capital as our track record has demonstrated and only look to invest capital if we believe it will create long-term value for our shareholder.
So with that, Anita, we will go ahead and open the call up for questions."

With me today, I do have the member of Cabot's -- members of the Cabot's executive team. On today's call, I would all be referring to slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for 2016 as well as our plans for 2017. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses about [ph] forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Now we'll move to the 2016 highlights on Slide 3. '16 was another positive year for Cabot Oil & Gas, especially in light of the lower commodity price backdrop we navigated through for a significant portion of the year. Our plan for the year was to deliver returns-focused production and reserve growth, to invest capital prudently while targeting a free cash flow positive investment program, and to continue to improve on our top-tier cost structure and to maintain strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident to say that we executed across the board on all these goals. 
Cabot grew production and proved reserve by 4% and 5%, respectively, from a capital program that was over 50% lower than 2015. Despite lower realized commodity prices for the year, which resulted in Cabot's lowest realized natural gas price in its history, we were able to deliver our production and reserve growth while generating positive free cash flow. That is quite an accomplishment. 
Our continued emphasis on cost control was demonstrated by our record-low all-source finding cost of $0.37 per Mcfe and our 11% year-over-year reduction in cash operating expense per unit. A significant portion of the reduction in our cost structure was driven by internally sourced operating efficiency gains that will remain in place, regardless of changes in the service cost environment. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $500 million of cash on hand and approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility. During the year, we reduced our debt outstanding by almost $500 million by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuance in early 2016, resulting in a significant reduction in leverage metrics throughout the year.
On the operational front, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR to 4.4 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral, improving our peer-leading EUR in Appalachia. I plan to discuss our updated Marcellus EUR further in the call.
Now let's move to Slide 4, where we have highlighted our production and reserve growth over the last few years. You can see that we have averaged a 15% and 16% compounded annual growth rate for production reserves, respectively, over the last 3 years. While our 2017 production growth guidance of 5% to 10% is slightly below our historic growth rate, as we await new takeaway capacity in the Marcellus, we are forecasting our discretionary cash flow to double this year based on recent strip prices, which is driven by significant improvement in cash margins due to higher realized prices and lower operating cost. We do expect a return-to-growth levels above this historic CAGR in 2018 as new infrastructure is in place throughout Appalachia. While we have not officially guided to '19 production levels, our internal forecast shows an even more robust level of growth in 2019. On the reserve front, I would emphasize that our proved developed growth has outpaced our total reserve growth, highlighting that our growth is coming through the drill bit and is not a function of adding excessive levels of proved, undeveloped reserves. 
Now I'll flip to Slide 5 through 7, kind of cover those all at one comment. They highlight the continued improvement we have seen in our drilling, completion and operating cost over the last 3 years. The cost reductions our operating team have achieved in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which are represented on Slide 5, have translated into significant improvements in our finding cost and our cash operating cost, as highlighted on Slides 6 and 7, respectively. 
On Slide 8 illustrates our capital budget and operating program for 2017. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have increased our total program spending for the year from $625 million to $720 million, which includes an $85 million increase for additional Eagle Ford activity to capitalize on the higher prices and, most importantly, improved well productivity; a $20 million increase in equity pipeline investments, driven by a more favorable outlook on the construction timing for Atlantic Sunrise; and a $15 million increase in the Marcellus, primarily for additional drilling activity, driven by faster drilling times. These increases in capital are offset by approximately $25 million of savings from additional Marcellus drilling efficiencies.
We plan to spend $610 million of drilling, completion and facility capital in 2017, of which 67% will go to the Marcellus and 33% will go to the Eagle Ford. This will fund the drilling and completion of approximately 90 net wells. We plan to exit 2017 with 45 DUCs, of which 35 are located in the Marcellus, positioning us well for accelerating production growth in 2018 upon the in-service of new takeaway capacity. 
Moving to Slide 9, which contains a reconciliation of the updated capital budget to the preliminary budget we discussed on the third quarter conference call, referencing the previously mentioned changes in the capital -- in capital for the year. I would also highlight that despite this increase in capital spending, we are currently forecasting approximately $250 million of positive free cash flow for the year based on recent strip prices. Additionally, while our production growth guidance of 5% to 10% remains unchanged, our year-over-year oil growth guidance of 15% is substantially higher than the 0% oil growth contained in our original budget. This increased oil growth moves us higher in our production guidance range and allows for more flexibility around curtailments in the Marcellus during the year, if warranted. However, based on current price expectations, we do not expect curtailments to be a concern.
Moving on to the Eagle Ford operation, Slide 10. During the second half of last year, we began testing new completion designs in the Eagle Ford to determine the impact of increased proppant loading, tighter cluster spacing, diversion technology. Wells on this slide do a great job highlighting the productivity gains we are seeing from our enhanced completions. The results from a 3-well pad that was completed last year are significantly outperforming the results from an offset pad that was completed with an older completion design. Additionally, you can see that well 1, which was recently completed with 1,800 pounds of proppant per foot, is outperforming the other 2 wells from the same pad that were completed with slightly less proppant. While the production history is still very limited, we are encouraged by the result and plan to implement enhanced completions throughout our program this year.
On the left side of Slide 11, we highlight the impact of our enhanced completions on our Eagle Ford returns. At today's well cost, our average 9,000-foot lateral generates a rate of return over 60% at a $50 per barrel realized price, which is about what we are realizing currently. Like all of our industry peers, we anticipate some level of cost inflation this year and are budgeting this inflation into our well cost for the second half of the year. You can see that even when assuming this inflationary pressure on well costs, our returns are still above 45%. Based on the improved economics and the expectation of higher oil prices later in 2017, we have increased our spending in the Eagle Ford to help pivot this asset back into growth mode as opposed to holding pattern it has been in, in the last couple of years. Accordingly, we anticipate growing our exit oil volumes this year by 50% as opposed to the 5% we forecasted in the original budget.
Heading over to Marcellus and turning to Slide 12. We have plotted the average cumulative production results for our Gen 4 completions compared to our prior type curves of 3.8 Bcf per thousand feet and our new type curve of 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet. While our sample size is still limited with only 21 wells based on production data we have to date and the fact that these 21 wells were drilled in the north, south, east and west, we are very confident that these results are repeatable across the field. 
While it's very well understood across the industry and investment community that Cabot's wells in Northeast Pennsylvania are some of the best wells in the country, Slide 13 illustrates how our EUR stacks up against other natural gas operating areas across the U.S. In fact, our 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet is double that of some of our peers who have been touting their technical expertise on the completion front. We continue to be impressed with the improvements in well productivity we see year after year and are in the process of testing other enhancements to our well design to further improve our economics.
Slide 14 demonstrates how our increasing EURs, our improvements in well cost and better-realized pricing are impacting our economics. We originally budgeted $7.9 million for our 8,000-foot lateral Gen 4 well cost back in October of last year. However, we are currently averaging about 10% lower due to improved operating efficiencies. Approximately 75% of our costs are locked in under term contracts, so we are anticipating only a slight increase in well cost by year-end. With this anticipated well cost, our rates of return at the current Leidy strip meet or exceed any return we have seen across the industry.
Moving on to marketing and infrastructure. Slide 15 shows Cabot's monthly realized natural gas prices before hedges, highlighting the significant improvement we have seen in pricing as we enter the winter heating season. While fourth quarter pricing was greatly improved relative to the first 3 quarters last year, the first quarter of '17 has been even better, driven by strong January and February. While the strip has pulled back as of late due to unfavorable weather forecast, we're still forecasting a substantial improvement in year-over-year realized prices, driven by higher NYMEX prices, tighter basin differentials and a strong portfolio of fixed-price contracts, primarily for the summer season.
As the title of Slide 16 indicates, '18 will be an inflection year for Cabot, both in terms of infrastructure additions and for our growth story. Moving to the left -- moving from the left to the right of the slide, Orion, Moxie and Lackawanna all remain on schedule. Orion received FERC certificate on February 2 and is expected to begin construction this summer. Our 2 power plant projects are currently under construction and on track for an in-service date listed on the slide. 
As you're aware, Atlantic Sunrise has reached several milestones since we last spoke, receiving the FERC -- or the final Environmental Impact Statement on December 30, 2016, and the FERC certificate approving the project on February 3. The next steps for Atlantic Sunrise, including finishing up permit work with the Pennsylvania DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and receiving the FERC notice -- and we need to receive the FERC notice to proceed with construction.
We expect all final approvals to be received by mid-summer and construction to begin shortly afterwards, and the in-service date remains mid-2018. Based on the recent progress that was made on these projects, we remain extremely confident in delivering on our production targets for 2018.
The PennEast project continues to make progress and is expected to receive its final Environmental Impact Statement in April, while Constitution Pipeline is still awaiting an answer from the Second Court of Appeals for permission to move forward. We expect news regarding Constitution status later in the second quarter.
As the slide illustrates, upon in-service of all these projects, Cabot will have the ability to double production volumes from its 2016 exit rate. As we have communicated in the past, the pace at which we fill this capacity with incremental growth volumes will ultimately be dependent upon the market environment. I would also highlight that our marketing team continues to identify new opportunities to increase Cabot's growth trajectory out of the Marcellus as evidenced through addition of a new 3-year sales contract of 150 million per day on Atlantic Sunrise that was announced at the end of last year.
Now we'll move on to Slide 17, which highlights the anticipated improvement in our realized pricing upon completion of the previously mentioned projects. We expect our overall realizations to improve for 2 primary reasons: First, the volumes that are shipped on these new projects are expected to receive favorable pricing in the new markets that we are accessing. Second, we anticipate our volumes that remain in the local market will see an improvement in realized prices as a result of tightening of in-basin differentials from the addition of new large-scale projects, like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast, and an increase in local demand from the addition of numerous new power plants in the Northeast operating area. Local demand could increase in excess of over 1 Bcf per day beginning as early as January 19 from power plant generation alone. I would also like to highlight that, while our forecasted differentials improve significantly between '17 and '18, without adding material amounts of transportation expense, our differentials are expected to improve even further in 2019 as we will receive the full year impact of the projects that were placed in-service intermittently throughout 2018. Not to mention if Constitution is placed in-service in 2018 or early 2019, that will have an even further positive impact on pricing as those volumes will reach favorable markets in the Northeast.
On another takeaway from this slide that I would like to add, is that for 2017, 36% of our volumes are locked in under fixed price contracts at a weighted average price of $2.29 per Mcf, which implies a rate of return greater than 150% for our typical Marcellus well. These volumes would typically be exposed to the local Northeast Pennsylvania indices that averaged about $1.30 in 2016, so we're very pleased with this portfolio of fixed-price contracts.
Finally, on Slide 18. We have attempted to address the most commonly asked question to get -- we get from our shareholders, and that is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow you expect to generate? I would first highlight that this is certainly a high-class problem to have, and most companies would be envious of our position. We have said time and time again that we believe we can ultimately generate the most shareholder value by delivering returns-focused production and reserve growth, and our current organic 5-year plan delivers on this strategy.
With that being said, we will continue to evaluate new opportunities, both internal and external, to identify new platforms for future growth that compete for capital internally and provide competitive full-cycle economics. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate returning incremental cash to the shareholder, most likely through increased dividend, and potentially reduce our debt levels over time as maturities come due. With the organic growth program we have teed up, you can rest assured that we will remain as disciplined with our capital as our track record has demonstrated and only look to invest capital if we believe it will create long-term value for our shareholder.
So with that, Anita, we will go ahead and open the call up for questions."

With me today, I do have the member of Cabot's -- members of the Cabot's executive team. On today's call, I would all be referring to slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for 2016 as well as our plans for 2017. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses about [ph] forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Now we'll move to the 2016 highlights on Slide 3. '16 was another positive year for Cabot Oil & Gas, especially in light of the lower commodity price backdrop we navigated through for a significant portion of the year. Our plan for the year was to deliver returns-focused production and reserve growth, to invest capital prudently while targeting a free cash flow positive investment program, and to continue to improve on our top-tier cost structure and to maintain strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident to say that we executed across the board on all these goals. 
Cabot grew production and proved reserve by 4% and 5%, respectively, from a capital program that was over 50% lower than 2015. Despite lower realized commodity prices for the year, which resulted in Cabot's lowest realized natural gas price in its history, we were able to deliver our production and reserve growth while generating positive free cash flow. That is quite an accomplishment. 
Our continued emphasis on cost control was demonstrated by our record-low all-source finding cost of $0.37 per Mcfe and our 11% year-over-year reduction in cash operating expense per unit. A significant portion of the reduction in our cost structure was driven by internally sourced operating efficiency gains that will remain in place, regardless of changes in the service cost environment. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $500 million of cash on hand and approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility. During the year, we reduced our debt outstanding by almost $500 million by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuance in early 2016, resulting in a significant reduction in leverage metrics throughout the year.
On the operational front, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR to 4.4 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral, improving our peer-leading EUR in Appalachia. I plan to discuss our updated Marcellus EUR further in the call.
Now let's move to Slide 4, where we have highlighted our production and reserve growth over the last few years. You can see that we have averaged a 15% and 16% compounded annual growth rate for production reserves, respectively, over the last 3 years. While our 2017 production growth guidance of 5% to 10% is slightly below our historic growth rate, as we await new takeaway capacity in the Marcellus, we are forecasting our discretionary cash flow to double this year based on recent strip prices, which is driven by significant improvement in cash margins due to higher realized prices and lower operating cost. We do expect a return-to-growth levels above this historic CAGR in 2018 as new infrastructure is in place throughout Appalachia. While we have not officially guided to '19 production levels, our internal forecast shows an even more robust level of growth in 2019. On the reserve front, I would emphasize that our proved developed growth has outpaced our total reserve growth, highlighting that our growth is coming through the drill bit and is not a function of adding excessive levels of proved, undeveloped reserves. 
Now I'll flip to Slide 5 through 7, kind of cover those all at one comment. They highlight the continued improvement we have seen in our drilling, completion and operating cost over the last 3 years. The cost reductions our operating team have achieved in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which are represented on Slide 5, have translated into significant improvements in our finding cost and our cash operating cost, as highlighted on Slides 6 and 7, respectively. 
On Slide 8 illustrates our capital budget and operating program for 2017. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have increased our total program spending for the year from $625 million to $720 million, which includes an $85 million increase for additional Eagle Ford activity to capitalize on the higher prices and, most importantly, improved well productivity; a $20 million increase in equity pipeline investments, driven by a more favorable outlook on the construction timing for Atlantic Sunrise; and a $15 million increase in the Marcellus, primarily for additional drilling activity, driven by faster drilling times. These increases in capital are offset by approximately $25 million of savings from additional Marcellus drilling efficiencies.
We plan to spend $610 million of drilling, completion and facility capital in 2017, of which 67% will go to the Marcellus and 33% will go to the Eagle Ford. This will fund the drilling and completion of approximately 90 net wells. We plan to exit 2017 with 45 DUCs, of which 35 are located in the Marcellus, positioning us well for accelerating production growth in 2018 upon the in-service of new takeaway capacity. 
Moving to Slide 9, which contains a reconciliation of the updated capital budget to the preliminary budget we discussed on the third quarter conference call, referencing the previously mentioned changes in the capital -- in capital for the year. I would also highlight that despite this increase in capital spending, we are currently forecasting approximately $250 million of positive free cash flow for the year based on recent strip prices. Additionally, while our production growth guidance of 5% to 10% remains unchanged, our year-over-year oil growth guidance of 15% is substantially higher than the 0% oil growth contained in our original budget. This increased oil growth moves us higher in our production guidance range and allows for more flexibility around curtailments in the Marcellus during the year, if warranted. However, based on current price expectations, we do not expect curtailments to be a concern.
Moving on to the Eagle Ford operation, Slide 10. During the second half of last year, we began testing new completion designs in the Eagle Ford to determine the impact of increased proppant loading, tighter cluster spacing, diversion technology. Wells on this slide do a great job highlighting the productivity gains we are seeing from our enhanced completions. The results from a 3-well pad that was completed last year are significantly outperforming the results from an offset pad that was completed with an older completion design. Additionally, you can see that well 1, which was recently completed with 1,800 pounds of proppant per foot, is outperforming the other 2 wells from the same pad that were completed with slightly less proppant. While the production history is still very limited, we are encouraged by the result and plan to implement enhanced completions throughout our program this year.
On the left side of Slide 11, we highlight the impact of our enhanced completions on our Eagle Ford returns. At today's well cost, our average 9,000-foot lateral generates a rate of return over 60% at a $50 per barrel realized price, which is about what we are realizing currently. Like all of our industry peers, we anticipate some level of cost inflation this year and are budgeting this inflation into our well cost for the second half of the year. You can see that even when assuming this inflationary pressure on well costs, our returns are still above 45%. Based on the improved economics and the expectation of higher oil prices later in 2017, we have increased our spending in the Eagle Ford to help pivot this asset back into growth mode as opposed to holding pattern it has been in, in the last couple of years. Accordingly, we anticipate growing our exit oil volumes this year by 50% as opposed to the 5% we forecasted in the original budget.
Heading over to Marcellus and turning to Slide 12. We have plotted the average cumulative production results for our Gen 4 completions compared to our prior type curves of 3.8 Bcf per thousand feet and our new type curve of 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet. While our sample size is still limited with only 21 wells based on production data we have to date and the fact that these 21 wells were drilled in the north, south, east and west, we are very confident that these results are repeatable across the field. 
While it's very well understood across the industry and investment community that Cabot's wells in Northeast Pennsylvania are some of the best wells in the country, Slide 13 illustrates how our EUR stacks up against other natural gas operating areas across the U.S. In fact, our 4.4 Bcf per thousand feet is double that of some of our peers who have been touting their technical expertise on the completion front. We continue to be impressed with the improvements in well productivity we see year after year and are in the process of testing other enhancements to our well design to further improve our economics.
Slide 14 demonstrates how our increasing EURs, our improvements in well cost and better-realized pricing are impacting our economics. We originally budgeted $7.9 million for our 8,000-foot lateral Gen 4 well cost back in October of last year. However, we are currently averaging about 10% lower due to improved operating efficiencies. Approximately 75% of our costs are locked in under term contracts, so we are anticipating only a slight increase in well cost by year-end. With this anticipated well cost, our rates of return at the current Leidy strip meet or exceed any return we have seen across the industry.
Moving on to marketing and infrastructure. Slide 15 shows Cabot's monthly realized natural gas prices before hedges, highlighting the significant improvement we have seen in pricing as we enter the winter heating season. While fourth quarter pricing was greatly improved relative to the first 3 quarters last year, the first quarter of '17 has been even better, driven by strong January and February. While the strip has pulled back as of late due to unfavorable weather forecast, we're still forecasting a substantial improvement in year-over-year realized prices, driven by higher NYMEX prices, tighter basin differentials and a strong portfolio of fixed-price contracts, primarily for the summer season.
As the title of Slide 16 indicates, '18 will be an inflection year for Cabot, both in terms of infrastructure additions and for our growth story. Moving to the left -- moving from the left to the right of the slide, Orion, Moxie and Lackawanna all remain on schedule. Orion received FERC certificate on February 2 and is expected to begin construction this summer. Our 2 power plant projects are currently under construction and on track for an in-service date listed on the slide. 
As you're aware, Atlantic Sunrise has reached several milestones since we last spoke, receiving the FERC -- or the final Environmental Impact Statement on December 30, 2016, and the FERC certificate approving the project on February 3. The next steps for Atlantic Sunrise, including finishing up permit work with the Pennsylvania DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and receiving the FERC notice -- and we need to receive the FERC notice to proceed with construction.
We expect all final approvals to be received by mid-summer and construction to begin shortly afterwards, and the in-service date remains mid-2018. Based on the recent progress that was made on these projects, we remain extremely confident in delivering on our production targets for 2018.
The PennEast project continues to make progress and is expected to receive its final Environmental Impact Statement in April, while Constitution Pipeline is still awaiting an answer from the Second Court of Appeals for permission to move forward. We expect news regarding Constitution status later in the second quarter.
As the slide illustrates, upon in-service of all these projects, Cabot will have the ability to double production volumes from its 2016 exit rate. As we have communicated in the past, the pace at which we fill this capacity with incremental growth volumes will ultimately be dependent upon the market environment. I would also highlight that our marketing team continues to identify new opportunities to increase Cabot's growth trajectory out of the Marcellus as evidenced through addition of a new 3-year sales contract of 150 million per day on Atlantic Sunrise that was announced at the end of last year.
Now we'll move on to Slide 17, which highlights the anticipated improvement in our realized pricing upon completion of the previously mentioned projects. We expect our overall realizations to improve for 2 primary reasons: First, the volumes that are shipped on these new projects are expected to receive favorable pricing in the new markets that we are accessing. Second, we anticipate our volumes that remain in the local market will see an improvement in realized prices as a result of tightening of in-basin differentials from the addition of new large-scale projects, like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast, and an increase in local demand from the addition of numerous new power plants in the Northeast operating area. Local demand could increase in excess of over 1 Bcf per day beginning as early as January 19 from power plant generation alone. I would also like to highlight that, while our forecasted differentials improve significantly between '17 and '18, without adding material amounts of transportation expense, our differentials are expected to improve even further in 2019 as we will receive the full year impact of the projects that were placed in-service intermittently throughout 2018. Not to mention if Constitution is placed in-service in 2018 or early 2019, that will have an even further positive impact on pricing as those volumes will reach favorable markets in the Northeast.
On another takeaway from this slide that I would like to add, is that for 2017, 36% of our volumes are locked in under fixed price contracts at a weighted average price of $2.29 per Mcf, which implies a rate of return greater than 150% for our typical Marcellus well. These volumes would typically be exposed to the local Northeast Pennsylvania indices that averaged about $1.30 in 2016, so we're very pleased with this portfolio of fixed-price contracts.
Finally, on Slide 18. We have attempted to address the most commonly asked question to get -- we get from our shareholders, and that is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow you expect to generate? I would first highlight that this is certainly a high-class problem to have, and most companies would be envious of our position. We have said time and time again that we believe we can ultimately generate the most shareholder value by delivering returns-focused production and reserve growth, and our current organic 5-year plan delivers on this strategy.
With that being said, we will continue to evaluate new opportunities, both internal and external, to identify new platforms for future growth that compete for capital internally and provide competitive full-cycle economics. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate returning incremental cash to the shareholder, most likely through increased dividend, and potentially reduce our debt levels over time as maturities come due. With the organic growth program we have teed up, you can rest assured that we will remain as disciplined with our capital as our track record has demonstrated and only look to invest capital if we believe it will create long-term value for our shareholder.
So with that, Anita, we will go ahead and open the call up for questions."

It doesn't take a great deal of capital to be able to drill a number of wells, complete the number of zones that we need to increase our production an additional Bcf a day. Rather unique in the industry to be able to say that. But the production volumes in our forecast generate so much free cash that there's not that opportunity to -- because of the low capital intensity, there's not the opportunity to redeploy it all into the Marcellus. I can assure you, every Mcf that we can put in a pipeline up in the Marcellus, we're going to do that, and we'll have ample funds to be able to fulfill that objective.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentatio",2254,"Thank you, Phil, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. 
On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for the quarter. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, all provided in both the earnings release and this presentation. 
Now let's move to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. Cabot grew daily production volumes by 7% relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in Marcellus volumes that benefited from a much improved natural gas price environment during the first quarter. Our production levels were right on top of the high-end of our production range for the quarter, which resulted in 6% growth sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year. The company pivoted from a net loss of $51 million in the first quarter of last year to a net income of $106 million during the first quarter of this year while increasing EBITDAX by over 200%. The improvements were primarily driven by 7% increase in daily production volumes, a 77% increase in natural gas price realizations and 11% decrease in operating expense per unit. Of the utmost importance, the company was able to grow production and cash flow while generating positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on our strong performance during the first quarter, coupled with the improved outlook for regional pricing for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year 2017 production growth guidance range from 5% to 10% to 8% to 12% without increasing our drill and complete capital for the year. 
Slide 4 illustrates the significant improvement we have seen in our pre hedge price realizations over the last 4 quarters. Realizations for April and May will likely be about $0.25 lower than the first quarter average. However, this implies that our average natural gas price realizations for the first 5 months of the year will be about 70% higher than the same period in 2016, highlighting the significant improvement in cash margins we are realizing to date. 
Moving to Slide 5, speaks to the improvement we have seen in the outlook for regional differentials, which is driven in large part by the anticipation of significant regional takeaway capacity additions in the near future, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise and Leach Express, coupled with a supply-side that has not kept pace with recent takeaway capacity additions. This improving outlook for differentials has driven our decision to modestly increase our anticipated production levels for the year. 
Now I'll move to Slide 6, which illustrates our updated capital budget for 2017. As I mentioned previously, we are increasing our production guidance range for the year without increasing our drilling capital -- drilling and complete capital, which is largely driven by the outperformance we have witnessed in our recent Gen 4 Marcellus completions. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have included up to $125 million of capital in this year's budget for exploratory lease acquisition and testing in new areas that have been analyzed. As we communicated in the year-end call in February, we has been evaluating new platforms for future growth that has the potential to generate competitive full cycle returns and we have identified two new areas that we believe warrant further testing. These are areas where we have direct line of sight towards building sizable contiguous acreage positions that allow for an efficient operations at, most importantly, a low-cost of entry. I will define a sizable position as one that has potential to provide over a decade of high-quality drilling inventory. 
I would also highlight that the $66 million or over 50% of the spending occurred in the first quarter. So these expenditures are front-end loaded this year. And the first quarter capital outlay are not indicative of the quarterly run rate we anticipate going forward. While these projects are in the early stage of evaluation and carry the risk that come along with exploration, based on the geomodeling our team has performed to date, we are cautiously optimistic about their potential. And that's why we move forward with the leasing and will subsequently test our ideas later this year. We will keep you updated on these projects if and when there is something commercial to discuss. 
Keep in mind, even with the spending, we still forecast over $250 million of positive free cash flow based on recent Strip prices. 
Moving on to operations. Slide 7 and 8 highlight the outperformance we are seeing in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for wells placed on production during the first quarter. While there's limited production data on these wells, the early results are very encouraging. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to place 14 enhanced completion wells on production this quarter and we'll continue to analyze the results over the coming months to determine the impact on estimated recoveries we are expecting as a result of the recent completion design enhancements. However, I am pleased with the results we've seen to date. 
Slide 9 illustrates the continued reduction in drilling costs we have experienced in both of our operating areas. While we are still forecasting some cost inflation throughout the year primarily on the pumping side of the component of our well cost, we only anticipate about a 5% increase in total cost in the Marcellus and possibly a 10% increase in our Eagle Ford well cost by year-end. However, in fact, our first quarter Marcellus and Eagle Ford well cost actually came in under budget. 
Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and highlights how our leverage metrics have been reduced to pre cycle -- pre down cycle levels. Based on our current 3-year plan, we continue to see a material deleveraging as we grow EBITDA at a healthy rate without adding any incremental leverage to the balance sheet, given our positive free cash flow outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 on which we have provided a brief update on the status of our upcoming takeaway projects. For purposes of this discussion, I will focus primarily on Atlantic Sunrise on the left-hand side of the slide. As most of you are aware, we received the FERC certificate approving the project back in early February. Since then, the Atlantic Sunrise team has been working on obtaining access to the remaining property in order to complete the survey needed for final permit application with the Pennsylvania DEP. I'm happy to report that we have now completed 100% of all cultural and environmental surveys required for the remaining permits in Pennsylvania. We expect to file the final permit application in early May and anticipate full approval and permits in early July. Based on this timing, we anticipate that construction on the greenfield portion of the project will begin in early third quarter 2017. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, we remain confident that the pipeline will be fully in service by mid 2018. We continue to hear from thousands of people who support the projects, individuals, chambers, business groups, labor unions, who recognize the economic benefit of the project, in addition to recognizing the important role it plays in supporting the tens of thousands of jobs tied to the state's natural gas industry. 
As far as other projects, on the right-hand side of the slide, all of these important capacity additions remained on schedule for our targeted in-service date with the exception of Constitution, the status of which is currently pending our appeal process. We are hoping for a positive outcome sometime in late second quarter based on the timing of appeals. 
Slide 12 is a new slide that we've rolled out at an investor conference last month, highlighting the capital efficiency and free cash flow potential of our Marcellus asset. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that we held production flat at 3.7 Bcf per day, which is our estimated productive capacity assuming we maintain our existing market share in basin and, ultimately, fill the incremental capacity additions we have listed in the new production -- with new production. This also excludes Constitution capacity given the uncertainty around the project timing. 
As you can see, this asset has the ability to generate significant amounts of annual free cash flow, even in a lower natural gas price environment. Concurrently -- currently, we modeled a long-term weighted average differential of approximately a negative $0.35 of NYMEX for the Marcellus asset, assuming no contribution from Constitution. Given that assumption, we would only need to see a $2.35 to $3.35 NYMEX price annually to achieve the $900 million to $2 billion range of pretax free cash flow highlighted on the bottom of the slide. I think most would agree, the range of NYMEX price is not a stretch, especially in light of all the demand growth we are anticipating throughout the remainder of this decade. 
The obvious follow-up question from this slide is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow? We have attempted to address some of the possibilities on Slide 13. Assuming the takeaway capacity is there and pricing is favorable, our first option would always be to reinvest it back into the Marcellus asset, given that we believe this is one of the most economic assets in the country. Assuming we cannot reinvest in all of the Marcellus, we will continue to look at allocating a small portion of the cash flow into the Eagle Ford assuming the returns justify it. I believe our increase in Eagle Ford capital earlier this year, coupled with our planned increase in Marcellus capital in 2018 to grow into the new takeaway capacity, highlights our commitment to this portion of the strategy. 
The bottom left box is a current focus of discussion for our management and the board and one that we take very seriously. Obviously, we have been in a bit of a holding pattern over the last few years as we await clarity on the timing of infrastructure and what that ultimate meant for our capital requirements as we began to ramp activity levels and production into these projects. As a result, even though we saw the likelihood of free cash flow on the horizon, we were hesitant to commit to any incremental return of cash to shareholders. However, as we get closer to having some of these projects in-service and therefore, have more confidence in the timing of being able to deliver free cash flow projects that [indiscernible] model implies, we are more focused on this discussion. I would highlight that in the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via our doubling of dividends in 2013 and the repurchase of shares in both '13 and '14. So it is certainly a priority of ours. 
For several years, I've been asked numerous times what Cabot plans to do with its anticipated cash flow outside of reinvesting in our current high level operating areas and returning cash to shareholders. As you may suspect, I have received a plethora of ideas from many different circles. The Cabot team has worked overtime, evaluating many plausible uses of our anticipated free cash with the objective to create long-term, sustainable value for Cabot shareholders. 
I have never deviated from this objective. Having a world-class asset as the cornerstone only enhances the challenge. Although, I might add, it is a high-class challenge. The surge carries us to many areas, including bolt-on acquisitions, joint ventures, acreage trays and our only -- and our internally generated greenfield ideas. In order for these greenfield ideas to warrant consideration for capital allocation, our team participates in an exhaustive evaluation process to determine if the idea meets our objectives. 
Several examples of our objective include the cost of entry. Do we think the idea can potentially generate full cycle returns and compete with our current portfolio? We also ask about high-quality drilling locations. Is the idea scalable? And well-positioned for efficient operations? What's the initial term from leasing to full scale efficient development? When do we get positive free cash flow? Impacts on balance sheet? Potential growth? 
So as you can see, all of these ideas have gone through our decision that we've come up with. I'm confident that Cabot's process of evaluation, risk assessment and methodology and methodical capital allocation will result in enhanced long-term value for its shareholders. As we highlighted earlier, there is a high degree of risk associated with a grassroots leasing exploration effort. However, compared to our evaluation of the acquisitions made in the M&A space and the implied first cycle economics on those transactions, we're comfortable with the risk profile and the potential project returns of our ideas to support this grassroots effort. After all, approximately 10 years ago, we drilled our first well in our grassroots Marcellus play in Northeast Pennsylvania and we have certainly been pleased with those returns. 
With that, Phil, I'd be happy to answer any questions."

So we were indifferent regarding the commodity diversity and looking at the areas potential competitive landscapes and a lot of areas that we're all aware of. Through an exploration effort, we evaluated every basin that is out there. We looked at actually areas that were not necessarily in traditional fairway of the key basins. But all in all, and bolling all of that up, also looking and evaluating all the M&A transactions that have transpired, we did go through some data rooms and get a good feel for valuations out there and that's based to be able to compare to. Not only did that meet our threshold the full cycle returns but also, did it allow for us to enhance our portfolio of projects on a go forward spend. And as we continue to do our exploration effort and our guys came up with good ideas that we felt justified further expenditure, and so when you look at our cost of entry and you look at the possible returns that we see in these 2 projects, then you look at the scale that we're comfortable with being able to develop, we are excited about where we've allocated the capital and we're also excited about moving forward with some incremental testing.

But in looking at our allocation of an additional $125 million, if you look historically at an exploration budget and you assess the amount that we've allocated in the past, the $125 million is frankly right in line with where we've allocated in the past, less than except the last 2 years. So there's nothing unique about that level of capital allocation. When we began our effort of looking at our needs in the future to enhance shareholder value, we look at the Marcellus and the Marcellus is such a low capital intensity asset i.e., the need for the number of drilling rigs and the need for a number of frac crews to grow our production that we knew we were going to generate a significant amount of free cash. As I mentioned, even in the most punitive realizations Cabot has had in its corporate history, in 2016, we still generated free cash and grew that asset. With this infrastructure build out, that is occurring as we speak. And looking at the amount of capital necessary to fulfill all of the capacity of those new projects, it -- again, it is not willing to take near the amount of free cash -- near the amount of capital that we are generating and we'll have the free cash. So the need to do something with the free cash is an obvious question because we have it. We put that slide together where we've tried to box out and include on Slide 13 the number of different considerations that we will consider with our free cash. We will touch on a number of them. We'll touch on, I think, the distribution to shareholders, with some of it. We'll also allocate the necessary amount to our Marcellus to grow every opportunity that we get. But again, it doesn't take much capital. And you could see by maintaining 3.7 Bcf flat for 25 years, we don't get much over $500 million, $600 million. So the free cash is there. We could do all these things that we're talking about. One of the ideas that every company that is in our space, E&P space, every company out there, and you can look at the hierarchy of valuations and those that you, in your portfolio, you recognize these companies that have significant value and have the opportunity to grow, you give them better multiples and more consideration and valuations and future valuations than you do those that do not grow. Again, we're not in the business to burn capital. We thought we could make an entry into new areas, take a cost-effective look at our opportunity to find new return projects that exceed -- compete with or exceed what we're allocating capital to right now. And if we are successful in that endeavor, I think Cabot shareholders are going to be rewarded handsomely for the decision."

And if, in fact, that is the case, we are going to certainly be pleased with those results. When you look at the other assets that are in the Eagle Ford, that might be in play out there, you have to burden some of that with the full cycle consideration that we have talked about in other basins where there was a lot of activity.

But we had to approach this with -- in a little bit of a unique way because we did have and do have a company that has really good assets. We were growing this company and anticipate further growth, certainly, once the infrastructure gets in place, we were generating free cash even in the most punitive price realization environments that we have seen in years. So we didn't want to mess that aspect of what we can deliver to shareholders up and confuse the market on whether or not the investment of that and any free cash going into another area for a large M&A transaction, what it would do to a full cycle return profile once you melt it all together? And we made the decision actually fairly early on that that did not return again full cycle, the values to the shareholder that we wanted to see.

We've got a very active program on market development up there. We've explored a lot of opportunities. We continue to think that having dependable, reliable reserves and the optionality that we have with our infrastructure up there, our gathering infrastructure, gives us a lot of advantages in moving gas to different markets and during different time periods. We want to do a number of expansions on the gathering system with our partnership with Williams and we've really created a unique opportunity for Cabot in allowing our gas to have access to multiple markets even on a daily basis. We've tested this concept, we're able to move gas between pipes to take advantage of pricing, but also just to take advantage of capturing market share when a pipeline goes underutilized. We do expect though longer-term and even as we weed into early 2018 to mid-2018 as our power plants getting ready for service and the Leidy Line project and even further out a little bit, PennEast, we expect to see a lot of flowing gas that's currently on our 3 major pipelines to fill the capacity that some producer shippers and market shippers have purchased on these new projects. We think that's going to free up some capacity in the existing pipeline infrastructure and we'll be able to grow some market share particularly on the pipes that we do business with, our customers on a daily basis. So I guess we're teaming up to take advantage of what we've participated in, in terms of commitments of FT and the power generators but we also think there's a unique opportunity to grow our market share based on what we see on the activity level with our peers and how we perceive the basin fulfilling the new capacity in the next 18 to 24 months."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation",2245,"Thank you, Phil, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for the quarter. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation. 
Now let's move to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. Cabot grew daily production volumes by 7% relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in Marcellus volumes that benefited from a much improved natural gas price environment during the first quarter. Our production levels were right on top of the high end of our production range for the quarter, which resulted in 6% growth sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year. The company pivoted from a net loss of $51 million in the first quarter of last year to a net income of $106 million during the first quarter of this year while increasing EBITDAX by over 200%. The improvements were primarily driven by 7% increase in daily production volumes, a 77% increase in natural gas price realizations and 11% decrease in operating expense per unit. Of the utmost importance, the company was able to grow production and cash flow while generating positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on our strong performance during the first quarter, coupled with the improved outlook for regional pricing for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year 2017 production growth guidance range from 5% to 10% to 8% to 12% without increasing our drill and complete capital for the year. 
Slide 4 illustrates the significant improvement we have seen in our prehedge price realizations over the last 4 quarters. Realizations for April and May will likely be about $0.25 lower than the first quarter average. However, this implies that our average natural gas price realizations for the first 5 months of the year will be about 70% higher than the same period in 2016, highlighting the significant improvement in cash margins we are realizing to date. 
Moving to Slide 5, speaks to the improvement we have seen in the outlook for regional differentials, which is driven in large part by the anticipation of significant regional takeaway capacity additions in the near future, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise and Leach XPress, coupled with a supply side that has not kept pace with recent takeaway capacity additions. This improving outlook for differentials has driven our decision to modestly increase our anticipated production levels for the year. 
Now I'll move to Slide 6, which illustrates our updated capital budget for 2017. As I mentioned previously, we are increasing our production guidance range for the year without increasing our drilling capital -- drill and complete capital, which is largely driven by the outperformance we have witnessed in our recent Gen 4 Marcellus completions. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have included up to $125 million of capital in this year's budget for exploratory lease acquisition and testing in new areas that have been analyzed. As we communicated on the year-end call in February, we has been evaluating new platforms for future growth that has the potential to generate competitive full-cycle returns, and we have identified 2 new areas that we believe warrant further testing. These are areas where we have direct line of sight towards building sizable, contiguous acreage positions that allow for an efficient operations at, most importantly, a low-cost of entry. I would define a sizable position as one that has the potential to provide over a decade of high-quality drilling inventory. 
I would also highlight that the $66 million or over 50% of the spending occurred in the first quarter, so these expenditures are front-end loaded this year. And the first quarter capital outlay are not indicative of the quarterly run rate we anticipate going forward. While these projects are in the early stage of evaluation and carry the risk that come along with exploration, based on the geomodeling our team has performed to date, we are cautiously optimistic about their potential. And that is why we moved forward with the leasing and will subsequently test our ideas later this year. We will keep you updated on these projects if and when there is something commercial to discuss. Keep in mind, even with the spending, we still forecast over $250 million of positive free cash flow based on recent Strip prices. 
Moving on to operations. Slide 7 and 8 highlight the outperformance we're seeing in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for wells placed on production during the first quarter. While there's limited production data on these wells, the early results are very encouraging. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to place 14 enhanced completion wells on production this quarter, and we'll continue to analyze the results over the coming months to determine the impact on estimated recoveries we are expecting as a result of the recent completion design enhancements. However, I am pleased with the results we have seen to date. 
Slide 9 illustrates the continued reduction in drilling costs we have experienced in both of our operating areas. While we are still forecasting some cost inflation throughout the year, primarily on the pumping side of the component of our well cost, we only anticipate about a 5% increase in total cost in the Marcellus and possibly a 10% increase in our Eagle Ford well cost by year-end. However, in fact, our first quarter Marcellus and Eagle Ford well cost actually came in under budget. 
Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and highlights how our leverage metrics have been reduced to precycle -- pre-down cycle levels. Based on our current 3-year plan, we continue to see a material deleveraging as we grow EBITDA at a healthy rate without adding any incremental leverage to the balance sheet, given our positive free cash flow outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 11, on which we have provided a brief update on the status of our upcoming takeaway projects. For purposes of this discussion, I will focus primarily on Atlantic Sunrise on the left-hand side of the slide. As most of you are aware, we received the FERC certificate approving the project back in early February. Since then, Atlantic Sunrise team has been working on obtaining access to the remaining property in order to complete the surveys needed for final permit application with the Pennsylvania DEP. I'm happy to report that we have now completed 100% of all cultural environmental surveys required for the remaining permits in Pennsylvania. We expect to file the final permit application in early May and anticipate full approval and permits in early July. 
Based on this timing, we anticipate that construction on the greenfield portion of the project will begin in early third quarter 2017. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, we remain confident that the pipeline will be fully in service by mid-2018. We continue to hear from thousands of people who support the projects, individuals, chambers, business groups, labor unions, who recognize the economic benefit of the project, in addition to recognizing the important role it plays in supporting the tens of thousands of jobs tied to the state's natural gas industry. 
As far as other projects, on the right-hand side of the slide, all of these important capacity additions remain on schedule for our targeted in-service date with the exception of Constitution, the status of which is currently pending our appeal process. We are hoping for a positive outcome sometime in late second quarter based on the timing of appeals. 
Slide 12 is a new slide that we rolled out at an investor conference last month, highlighting the capital efficiency and free cash flow potential of our Marcellus asset. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that we held production flat at 3.7 Bcf per day, which is our estimated productive capacity, assuming we maintain our existing market share in basin and, ultimately, fill the incremental capacity additions we have listed in the new -- with new production. This also excludes Constitution capacity given the uncertainty around the project timing. 
As you can see, this asset has the ability to generate significant amounts of annual free cash flow even in a lower natural gas price environment. Concurrently -- currently, we modeled a long-term, weighted average differential of approximately a negative $0.35 of NYMEX for the Marcellus asset, assuming no contribution from Constitution. Given that assumption, we would only need to see a $2.35 to $3.35 NYMEX price annually to achieve the $900 million to $2 billion range of pretax free cash flow highlighted on the bottom of the slide. I think most would agree, the range of NYMEX price is not a stretch, especially in light of all the demand growth we are anticipating throughout the remainder of this decade. 
The obvious follow-up question from this slide is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow? We have attempted to address some of the possibilities on Slide 13. Assuming the takeaway capacity is there and pricing is favorable, our first option would always be to reinvest it back into the Marcellus asset, given that we believe this is one of the most economic assets in the country. Assuming we cannot reinvest at all in the Marcellus, we will continue to look at allocating a small portion of the cash flow into the Eagle Ford, assuming the returns justify it. I believe our increase in Eagle Ford capital earlier this year, coupled with our planned increase in Marcellus capital in 2018 to grow into the new takeaway capacity, highlights our commitment to this portion of the strategy. 
The bottom-left box is a current focus of discussion for our management and the board and one that we take very seriously. Obviously, we have been in a bit of a holding pattern over the last few years as we await clarity on the timing of infrastructure and what that ultimately meant for our capital requirements as we began to ramp activity levels and production into these projects. As a result, even though we saw the likelihood of free cash flow on the horizon, we were hesitant to commit to any incremental return of cash to shareholders. However, as we get closer to having some of these projects in-service and, therefore, have more confidence in the timing of being able to deliver free cash flow projects that income model implies, we are more focused on this discussion. I would highlight that in the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via our doubling of dividends in 2013 and the repurchase of shares in both '13 and '14. So it is certainly a priority of ours. 
For several years, I've been asked numerous times what Cabot plans to do with its anticipated cash flow outside of reinvesting in our current high-level operating areas and returning cash to shareholders. As you may suspect, I have received a plethora of ideas from many different circles. The Cabot team has worked overtime, evaluating many plausible uses of our anticipated free cash with the objective to create long-term, sustainable value for Cabot shareholders. 
I have never deviated from this objective. Having a world-class asset as the cornerstone only enhances the challenge. Although, I might add, it is a high-class challenge. The search carries us to many areas, including bolt-on acquisitions, joint ventures, acreage trays and our only -- and our internally generated greenfield ideas. In order for these greenfield ideas to warrant consideration for capital allocation, our team participates in an exhaustive evaluation process to determine if the idea meets our objectives. 
Several examples of our objective include the cost of entry. Do we think the idea can potentially generate full-cycle returns and compete with our current portfolio? We also ask about high-quality drilling locations. Is the idea scalable and well positioned for efficient operations? What's the initial term from leasing to full-scale, efficient development? When do we get positive free cash flow? Impacts on balance sheet? Potential growth? 
So as you can see, all of these ideas have gone through our decision that we've come up with. I'm confident that Cabot's process of evaluation, risk assessment and methodology and methodical capital allocation will result in enhanced long-term value for its shareholders. As we highlighted earlier, there's a high degree of risk associated with a grassroots leasing exploration effort. However, compared to our evaluation of the acquisitions made in the M&A space and the implied first-cycle economics on those transactions, we're comfortable with the risk profile and the potential project returns of our ideas to support this grassroots effort. After all, approximately 10 years ago, we drilled our first well in our grassroots Marcellus play in Northeast Pennsylvania and we have certainly been pleased with those returns. 
With that, Phil, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

So we were indifferent regarding the commodity diversity. And looking at the areas of potential competitive landscapes and a lot of areas that we're all aware of, through an exploration effort, we evaluated every basin that is out there. We looked at actually areas that were not necessarily in traditional fairway of the key basins. But all in all, and balling all of that up, also looking and evaluating all the M&A transactions that have transpired, we did go through some data rooms and get a good feel for valuations out there in that space to be able to compare to, not only did that meet our threshold of full-cycle returns but also, did it allow for us to enhance our portfolio of projects on a go-forward spend. And as we continue to do our exploration effort -- and our guys came up with good ideas that we felt justified further expenditure. And so when you look at our cost of entry and you look at the possible returns that we see in these 2 projects, then you look at the scale that we're comfortable with being able to develop, we are excited about where we've allocated the capital, and we're also excited about moving forward with some incremental testing.

But in looking at our allocation of an additional $125 million, if you look historically at an exploration budget and you assess the amount that we've allocated in the past, the $125 million is frankly right in line with where we've allocated in the past, less than -- except the last 2 years. So there's nothing unique about that level of capital allocation. When we began our effort of looking at our needs in the future to enhance shareholder value, we look at the Marcellus, and the Marcellus is such a low-capital-intensity asset, i.e. the need for the number of drilling rigs and the need for a number of frac crews to grow our production, that we knew we were going to generate a significant amount of free cash. As I mentioned, even in the most punitive realizations Cabot has had in its corporate history, in -- through 2016, we still generated free cash and grew that asset. With this infrastructure build-out that is occurring as we speak, and looking at the amount of capital necessary to fulfill all of the capacity of those new projects, it again, is not going to take near the amount of free -- near the amount of capital that we are generating, and we'll have the free cash. So the need to do something with the free cash is an obvious question because we have it. We put that slide together where we've tried to box out and include on Slide 13 the number of different considerations that we will consider with our free cash. We will touch on a number of them. We'll touch on, I think, the distribution to shareholders with some of it. We'll also allocate the necessary amount to our Marcellus to grow every opportunity that we get. But again, it doesn't take much capital. And you could see by maintaining 3.7 Bcf flat for 25 years, we don't get much over $500 million, $600 million. So the free cash is there. We could do all these things that we're talking about. One of the ideas that every company that is in our space, E&P space, every company out there -- and you can look at the hierarchy of valuations and those that you, in your portfolio, you recognize these companies that have significant value and have the opportunity to grow. You give them better multiples and more consideration and valuations and future valuations than you do those that do not grow. Again, we're not in the business to burn capital.

We were growing this company and anticipate further growth, certainly once the infrastructure gets in place. We were generating free cash, even in the most punitive price realization environments that we have seen in years. So we didn't want to mess that aspect of what we can deliver to shareholders up and confuse the market on whether or not the investment of that -- any free cash going into another area for a large M&A transaction, what it would do to full-cycle return profile once you melt it all together. And we made the decision, actually, fairly early on that, that did not return, again, full cycle, the values to the shareholder that we wanted to see. So we began -- continued in earnest to look for ideas that we thought we could create as a grassroots effort. And that's where we have gone.

We're also looking at additional market share and teaming up, partnership with market on a couple of projects.

And then how the company's thinking about potentially capturing local market share growth above FT capacity when the basin debottlenecks?"

We've got a very active program on market development up there. We've explored a lot of opportunities. We continue to think that having dependable, reliable reserves and the optionality that we have with our infrastructure up there, our gathering infrastructure, gives us a lot of advantages in moving gas to different markets and during different time periods. We went to a number of expansions on the gathering system with our partnership with Williams, and we've really created a unique opportunity for Cabot in allowing our gas to have access to multiple markets, even on a daily basis. We've tested this concept. We're able to move gas between pipes to take advantage of pricing, but also just to take advantage of capturing market share when a pipeline goes underutilized. We do expect though longer term, and even as we move in to early 2018 to mid-2018, as our power plants get ready for service and the Atlantic Sunrise project and even further out a little bit, PennEast, we expect to see a lot of flowing gas that's currently on our 3 major pipelines to fill the capacity that some producer shippers and market shippers have purchased on these new projects. We think that's going to free up some capacity in the existing pipeline infrastructure, and we'll be able to grow some market share, particularly on the pipes that we do business with our customers on a daily basis. So I guess we're teeing it up to take advantage of what we've participated in, in terms of commitments of FT and the power generators. But we also think there's a unique opportunity to grow our market share based on what we see on the activity level with our peers and how we perceive the basin fulfilling the new capacity in the next 18 to 24 months."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation",2250,"Thank you, Phil, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for the quarter. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation. 
Now let's move to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. Cabot grew daily production volumes by 7% relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in Marcellus volumes that benefited from a much improved natural gas price environment during the first quarter. Our production levels were right on top of the high end of our production range for the quarter, which resulted in 6% growth sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year. The company pivoted from a net loss of $51 million in the first quarter of last year to a net income of $106 million during the first quarter of this year while increasing EBITDAX by over 200%. The improvements were primarily driven by 7% increase in daily production volumes, a 77% increase in natural gas price realizations and 11% decrease in operating expense per unit. Of the utmost importance, the company was able to grow production and cash flow while generating positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on our strong performance during the first quarter, coupled with the improved outlook for regional pricing for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year 2017 production growth guidance range from 5% to 10% to 8% to 12% without increasing our drill and complete capital for the year. 
Slide 4 illustrates the significant improvement we have seen in our prehedge price realizations over the last 4 quarters. Realizations for April and May will likely be about $0.25 lower than the first quarter average. However, this implies that our average natural gas price realizations for the first 5 months of the year will be about 70% higher than the same period in 2016, highlighting the significant improvement in cash margins we are realizing to date. 
Moving to Slide 5, speaks to the improvement we have seen in the outlook for regional differentials, which is driven in large part by the anticipation of significant regional takeaway capacity additions in the near future, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise and Leach XPress, coupled with a supply side that has not kept pace with recent takeaway capacity additions. This improving outlook for differentials has driven our decision to modestly increase our anticipated production levels for the year. 
Now I'll move to Slide 6, which illustrates our updated capital budget for 2017. As I mentioned previously, we are increasing our production guidance range for the year without increasing our drilling capital -- drill and complete capital, which is largely driven by the outperformance we have witnessed in our recent Gen 4 Marcellus completions. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have included up to $125 million of capital in this year's budget for exploratory lease acquisition and testing in new areas that have been analyzed. As we communicated on the year-end call in February, we have been evaluating new platforms for future growth that has the potential to generate competitive full-cycle returns, and we have identified 2 new areas that we believe warrant further testing. These are areas where we have direct line of sight towards building sizable, contiguous acreage positions that allow for an efficient operations at, most importantly, a low-cost of entry. I would define a sizable position as one that has the potential to provide over a decade of high-quality drilling inventory. 
I would also highlight that the $66 million or over 50% of the spending occurred in the first quarter, so these expenditures are front-end loaded this year. And the first quarter capital outlay are not indicative of the quarterly run rate we anticipate going forward. While these projects are in the early stage of evaluation and carry the risk that come along with exploration, based on the geomodeling our team has performed to date, we are cautiously optimistic about their potential. And that is why we moved forward with the leasing and will subsequently test our ideas later this year. We will keep you updated on these projects if and when there is something commercial to discuss. Keep in mind, even with the spending, we still forecast over $250 million of positive free cash flow based on recent Strip prices. 
Moving on to operations. Slide 7 and 8 highlight the outperformance we're seeing in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for wells placed on production during the first quarter. While there's limited production data on these wells, the early results are very encouraging. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to place 14 enhanced completion wells on production this quarter, and we'll continue to analyze the results over the coming months to determine the impact on estimated recoveries we are expecting as a result of the recent completion design enhancements. However, I am pleased with the results we have seen to date. 
Slide 9 illustrates the continued reduction in drilling costs we have experienced in both of our operating areas. While we are still forecasting some cost inflation throughout the year, primarily on the pumping side of the component of our well cost, we only anticipate about a 5% increase in total cost in the Marcellus and possibly a 10% increase in our Eagle Ford well cost by year-end. However, in fact, our first quarter Marcellus and Eagle Ford well cost actually came in under budget. 
Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and highlights how our leverage metrics have been reduced to precycle -- pre-down cycle levels. Based on our current 3-year plan, we continue to see a material deleveraging as we grow EBITDA at a healthy rate without adding any incremental leverage to the balance sheet, given our positive free cash flow outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 11, on which we have provided a brief update on the status of our upcoming takeaway projects. For purposes of this discussion, I will focus primarily on Atlantic Sunrise on the left-hand side of the slide. As most of you are aware, we received the FERC certificate approving the project back in early February. Since then, Atlantic Sunrise team has been working on obtaining access to the remaining property in order to complete the surveys needed for final permit application with the Pennsylvania DEP. I'm happy to report that we have now completed 100% of all cultural environmental surveys required for the remaining permits in Pennsylvania. We expect to file the final permit application in early May and anticipate full approval and permits in early July. 
Based on this timing, we anticipate that construction on the greenfield portion of the project will begin in early third quarter 2017. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, we remain confident that the pipeline will be fully in service by mid-2018. We continue to hear from thousands of people who support the projects, individuals, chambers, business groups, labor unions, who recognize the economic benefit of the project, in addition to recognizing the important role it plays in supporting the tens of thousands of jobs tied to the state's natural gas industry. 
As far as other projects, on the right-hand side of the slide, all of these important capacity additions remain on schedule for our targeted in-service date with the exception of Constitution, the status of which is currently pending our appeal process. We are hoping for a positive outcome sometime in late second quarter based on the timing of appeals. 
Slide 12 is a new slide that we rolled out at an investor conference last month, highlighting the capital efficiency and free cash flow potential of our Marcellus asset. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that we held production flat at 3.7 Bcf per day, which is our estimated productive capacity, assuming we maintain our existing market share in basin and, ultimately, fill the incremental capacity additions we have listed in the new -- with new production. This also excludes Constitution capacity given the uncertainty around the project timing. 
As you can see, this asset has the ability to generate significant amounts of annual free cash flow even in a lower natural gas price environment. Concurrently -- currently, we modeled a long-term, weighted average differential of approximately a negative $0.35 of NYMEX for the Marcellus asset, assuming no contribution from Constitution. Given that assumption, we would only need to see a $2.35 to $3.35 NYMEX price annually to achieve the $900 million to $2 billion range of pretax free cash flow highlighted on the bottom of the slide. I think most would agree, the range of NYMEX price is not a stretch, especially in light of all the demand growth we are anticipating throughout the remainder of this decade. 
The obvious follow-up question from this slide is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow? We have attempted to address some of the possibilities on Slide 13. Assuming the takeaway capacity is there and pricing is favorable, our first option would always be to reinvest it back into the Marcellus asset, given that we believe this is one of the most economic assets in the country. Assuming we cannot reinvest it all into the Marcellus, we will continue to look at allocating a small portion of the cash flow into the Eagle Ford, assuming the returns justify it. I believe our increase in Eagle Ford capital earlier this year, coupled with our planned increase in Marcellus capital in 2018 to grow into the new takeaway capacity, highlights our commitment to this portion of the strategy. 
The bottom-left box is a current focus of discussion for our management and the board and one that we take very seriously. Obviously, we have been in a bit of a holding pattern over the last few years as we await clarity on the timing of infrastructure and what that ultimately meant for our capital requirements as we began to ramp activity levels and production into these projects. As a result, even though we saw the likelihood of free cash flow on the horizon, we were hesitant to commit to any incremental return of cash to shareholders. However, as we get closer to having some of these projects in-service and, therefore, have more confidence in the timing of being able to deliver free cash flow projects that our income model implies, we are more focused on this discussion. I would highlight that in the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via our doubling of dividends in 2013 and the repurchase of shares in both '13 and '14. So it is certainly a priority of ours. 
For several years, I've been asked numerous times what Cabot plans to do with its anticipated cash flow outside of reinvesting in our current high-level operating areas and returning cash to shareholders. As you may suspect, I have received a plethora of ideas from many different circles. The Cabot team has worked overtime, evaluating many plausible uses of our anticipated free cash with the objective to create long-term, sustainable value for Cabot shareholders. 
I have never deviated from this objective. Having a world-class asset as the cornerstone only enhances the challenge. Although, I might add, it is a high-class challenge. The search carries us to many areas, including bolt-on acquisitions,  joint ventures, acreage trays and our only -- and our internally generated greenfield ideas. In order for these greenfield ideas to warrant consideration for capital allocation, our team participates in an exhaustive evaluation process to determine if the idea meets our objectives. 
Several examples of our objective include the cost of entry. Do we think the idea can potentially generate full-cycle returns and compete with our current portfolio? We also ask about high-quality drilling locations. Is the idea scalable and well positioned for efficient operations? What's the initial term from leasing to full-scale, efficient development? When do we get positive free cash flow? Impacts on balance sheet? Potential growth? 
So as you can see, all of these ideas have gone through our decision that we've come up with. I'm confident that Cabot's process of evaluation, risk assessment and methodology and methodical capital allocation will result in enhanced long-term value for its shareholders. As we highlighted earlier, there's a high degree of risk associated with [ audio gap ]  a grassroots leasing exploration effort. However, compared to our evaluation of the acquisitions made in the M&A space and the implied first-cycle economics on those transactions, we're comfortable with the risk profile and the potential project returns of our ideas to support this grassroots effort. After all, approximately 10 years ago, we drilled our first well in our grassroots Marcellus play in Northeast Pennsylvania and we have certainly been pleased with those returns. 
With that, Phil, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

So we were indifferent regarding the commodity diversity. And looking at the areas of potential competitive landscapes and a lot of areas that we're all aware of, through an exploration effort, we evaluated every basin that is out there. We looked at actually areas that were not necessarily in traditional fairway of the key basins. But all in all, and balling all of that up, also looking and evaluating all the M&A transactions that have transpired, we did go through some data rooms and get a good feel for valuations out there in that space to be able to compare to, not only did that meet our threshold of full-cycle returns but also, did it allow for us to enhance our portfolio of projects on a go-forward spend. And as we continue to do our exploration effort -- and our guys came up with some good ideas that we felt justified further expenditure. And so when you look at our cost of entry and you look at the possible returns that we see in these 2 projects, then you look at the scale that we're comfortable with being able to develop, we are excited about where we've allocated the capital, and we're also excited about moving forward with some incremental testing.

But in looking at our allocation of an additional $125 million, if you look historically at an exploration budget and you assess the amount that we've allocated in the past, the $125 million is frankly right in line with where we've allocated in the past, less than -- except the last 2 years. So there's nothing unique about that level of capital allocation. When we began our effort of looking at our needs in the future to enhance shareholder value, we look at the Marcellus, and the Marcellus is such a low-capital-intensity asset, i.e. the need for the number of drilling rigs and the need for a number of frac crews to grow our production, that we knew we were going to generate a significant amount of free cash. As I mentioned, even in the most punitive realizations Cabot has had in its corporate history, in -- through 2016, we still generated free cash and grew that asset. With this infrastructure build-out that is occurring as we speak, and looking at the amount of capital necessary to fulfill all of the capacity of those new projects, it again, is not going to take near the amount of free -- near the amount of capital that we are generating, and we'll have the free cash. So the need to do something with the free cash is an obvious question because we have it. We put that slide together where we've tried to box out and include on Slide 13 the number of different considerations that we will consider with our free cash. We will touch on a number of them. We'll touch on, I think, the distribution to shareholders with some of it. We'll also allocate the necessary amount to our Marcellus to grow every opportunity that we get. But again, it doesn't take much capital. And you could see by maintaining 3.7 Bcf flat for 25 years, we don't get much over $500 million, $600 million. So the free cash is there. We could do all these things that we're talking about. One of the ideas that every company that is in our space, E&P space, every company out there -- and you can look at the hierarchy of valuations and those that you, in your portfolio, you recognize those companies that have significant value and have the opportunity to grow. You give them better multiples and more consideration and valuations and future valuations than you do those that do not grow. Again, we're not in the business to burn capital. We thought we could make an entry into new areas, take a cost-effective look at our opportunity to find new return projects that exceed -- compete with or exceed what we're allocating capital to right now. And if we are successful in that endeavor, I think Cabot shareholders are going to be rewarded handsomely for the decision."

We were growing this company and anticipate further growth, certainly once the infrastructure gets in place. We were generating free cash, even in the most punitive price realization environments that we have seen in years. So we didn't want to mess that aspect of what we can deliver to shareholders up and confuse the market on whether or not the investment of that -- any free cash going into another area for a large M&A transaction, what it would do to full-cycle return profile once you melt it all together. And we made the decision, actually, fairly early on that, that did not return, again, full-cycle, the values to the shareholder that we wanted to see. So we began -- continued in earnest to look for ideas that we thought we could create as a grassroots effort. And that's where we have gone.

We're looking at several larger-scale projects with ethanol developers and methane-to-gasoline projects. We're also looking at additional market share and teaming up, partnership with market on a couple of projects. We have not ruled out another pipeline, although pipelines are challenging in this environment. But we're continuing down that path with, again, a couple of markets.

We've got a very active program on market development up there. We've explored a lot of opportunities. We continue to think that having dependable, reliable reserves and the optionality that we have with our infrastructure up there, our gathering infrastructure, gives us a lot of advantages in moving gas to different markets and during different time periods. We went to a number of expansions on the gathering system with our partnership with Williams, and we've really created a unique opportunity for Cabot in allowing our gas to have access to multiple markets, even on a daily basis. We've tested this concept. We're able to move gas between pipes to take advantage of pricing, but also just to take advantage of capturing market share when a pipeline goes underutilized. We do expect though longer term, and even as we move in to early 2018 to mid-2018, as our power plants get ready for service and the Atlantic Sunrise project and even further out a little bit, PennEast, we expect to see a lot of flowing gas that's currently on our 3 major pipelines that fill the capacity that some producer shippers and market shippers have purchased on these new projects. We think that's going to free up some capacity in the existing pipeline infrastructure, and we'll be able to grow some market share, particularly on the pipes that we do business with our customers on a daily basis. So I guess we're teeing it up to take advantage of what we've participated in, in terms of commitments of FT and the power generators. But we also think there's a unique opportunity to grow our market share based on what we see on the activity level with our peers and how we perceive the basin fulfilling the new capacity in the next 18 to 24 months."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation",2248,"Thank you, Phil, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation we posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for the quarter. 
Before we get started, I would like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation. 
Now let's move to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. Cabot grew daily production volumes by 7% relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in Marcellus volumes that benefited from a much improved natural gas price environment during the first quarter. Our production levels were right on top of the high end of our production range for the quarter, which resulted in 6% growth sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year. The company pivoted from a net loss of $51 million in the first quarter of last year to a net income of $106 million during the first quarter of this year while increasing EBITDAX by over 200%. The improvements were primarily driven by 7% increase in daily production volumes, a 77% increase in natural gas price realizations and 11% decrease in operating expense per unit. Of the utmost importance, the company was able to grow production and cash flow while generating positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on our strong performance during the first quarter, coupled with the improved outlook for regional pricing for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year 2017 production growth guidance range from 5% to 10% to 8% to 12% without increasing our drill and complete capital for the year. 
Slide 4 illustrates the significant improvement we have seen in our prehedge price realizations over the last 4 quarters. Realizations for April and May will likely be about $0.25 lower than the first quarter average. However, this implies that our average natural gas price realizations for the first 5 months of the year will be about 70% higher than the same period in 2016, highlighting the significant improvement in cash margins we are realizing to date. 
Moving to Slide 5, speaks to the improvement we have seen in the outlook for regional differentials, which is driven in large part by the anticipation of significant regional takeaway capacity additions in the near future, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise and Leach XPress, coupled with a supply side that has not kept pace with recent takeaway capacity additions. This improving outlook for differentials has driven our decision to modestly increase our anticipated production levels for the year. 
Now I'll move to Slide 6, which illustrates our updated capital budget for 2017. As I mentioned previously, we are increasing our production guidance range for the year without increasing our drilling capital -- drill and complete capital, which is largely driven by the outperformance we have witnessed in our recent Gen 4 Marcellus completions. As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have included up to $125 million of capital in this year's budget for exploratory lease acquisition and testing in new areas that have been analyzed. As we communicated on the year-end call in February, we have been evaluating new platforms for future growth that has the potential to generate competitive full-cycle returns, and we have identified 2 new areas that we believe warrant further testing. These are areas where we have direct line of sight towards building sizable, contiguous acreage positions that allow for an efficient operations at, most importantly, a low-cost of entry. I would define a sizable position as one that has the potential to provide over a decade of high-quality drilling inventory. 
I would also highlight that the $66 million or over 50% of the spending occurred in the first quarter, so these expenditures are front-end loaded this year. And the first quarter capital outlay are not indicative of the quarterly run rate we anticipate going forward. While these projects are in the early stage of evaluation and carry the risk that come along with exploration, based on the geomodeling our team has performed to date, we are cautiously optimistic about their potential. And that is why we moved forward with the leasing and will subsequently test our ideas later this year. We will keep you updated on these projects if and when there is something commercial to discuss. Keep in mind, even with the spending, we still forecast over $250 million of positive free cash flow based on recent Strip prices. 
Moving on to operations. Slide 7 and 8 highlight the outperformance we're seeing in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for wells placed on production during the first quarter. While there's limited production data on these wells, the early results are very encouraging. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to place 14 enhanced completion wells on production this quarter, and we'll continue to analyze the results over the coming months to determine the impact on estimated recoveries we are expecting as a result of the recent completion design enhancements. However, I am pleased with the results we have seen to date. 
Slide 9 illustrates the continued reduction in drilling costs we have experienced in both of our operating areas. While we are still forecasting some cost inflation throughout the year, primarily on the pumping side of the component of our well cost, we only anticipate about a 5% increase in total cost in the Marcellus and possibly a 10% increase in our Eagle Ford well cost by year-end. However, in fact, our first quarter Marcellus and Eagle Ford well cost actually came in under budget. 
Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and highlights how our leverage metrics have been reduced to precycle -- pre-down cycle levels. Based on our current 3-year plan, we continue to see a material deleveraging as we grow EBITDA at a healthy rate without adding any incremental leverage to the balance sheet, given our positive free cash flow outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 11, on which we have provided a brief update on the status of our upcoming takeaway projects. For purposes of this discussion, I will focus primarily on Atlantic Sunrise on the left-hand side of the slide. As most of you are aware, we received the FERC certificate approving the project back in early February. Since then, Atlantic Sunrise team has been working on obtaining access to the remaining property in order to complete the surveys needed for final permit application with the Pennsylvania DEP. I'm happy to report that we have now completed 100% of all cultural environmental surveys required for the remaining permits in Pennsylvania. We expect to file the final permit application in early May and anticipate full approval and permits in early July. 
Based on this timing, we anticipate that construction on the greenfield portion of the project will begin in early third quarter 2017. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, we remain confident that the pipeline will be fully in service by mid-2018. We continue to hear from thousands of people who support the projects, individuals, chambers, business groups, labor unions, who recognize the economic benefit of the project, in addition to recognizing the important role it plays in supporting the tens of thousands of jobs tied to the state's natural gas industry. 
As far as other projects, on the right-hand side of the slide, all of these important capacity additions remain on schedule for our targeted in-service date with the exception of Constitution, the status of which is currently pending our appeal process. We are hoping for a positive outcome sometime in late second quarter based on the timing of appeals. 
Slide 12 is a new slide that we rolled out at an investor conference last month, highlighting the capital efficiency and free cash flow potential of our Marcellus asset. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that we held production flat at 3.7 Bcf per day, which is our estimated productive capacity, assuming we maintain our existing market share in basin and, ultimately, fill the incremental capacity additions we have listed in the new -- with new production. This also excludes Constitution capacity given the uncertainty around the project timing. 
As you can see, this asset has the ability to generate significant amounts of annual free cash flow even in a lower natural gas price environment. Concurrently -- currently, we modeled a long-term, weighted average differential of approximately a negative $0.35 of NYMEX for the Marcellus asset, assuming no contribution from Constitution. Given that assumption, we would only need to see a $2.35 to $3.35 NYMEX price annually to achieve the $900 million to $2 billion range of pretax free cash flow highlighted on the bottom of the slide. I think most would agree, the range of NYMEX price is not a stretch, especially in light of all the demand growth we are anticipating throughout the remainder of this decade. 
The obvious follow-up question from this slide is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow? We have attempted to address some of the possibilities on Slide 13. Assuming the takeaway capacity is there and pricing is favorable, our first option would always be to reinvest it back into the Marcellus asset, given that we believe this is one of the most economic assets in the country. Assuming we cannot reinvest it all into the Marcellus, we will continue to look at allocating a small portion of the cash flow into the Eagle Ford, assuming the returns justify it. I believe our increase in Eagle Ford capital earlier this year, coupled with our planned increase in Marcellus capital in 2018 to grow into the new takeaway capacity, highlights our commitment to this portion of the strategy. 
The bottom-left box is a current focus of discussion for our management and the board and one that we take very seriously. Obviously, we have been in a bit of a holding pattern over the last few years as we await clarity on the timing of infrastructure and what that ultimately meant for our capital requirements as we began to ramp activity levels and production into these projects. As a result, even though we saw the likelihood of free cash flow on the horizon, we were hesitant to commit to any incremental return of cash to shareholders. However, as we get closer to having some of these projects in-service and, therefore, have more confidence in the timing of being able to deliver free cash flow projects that our income model implies, we are more focused on this discussion. I would highlight that in the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via our doubling of dividends in 2013 and the repurchase of shares in both '13 and '14. So it is certainly a priority of ours. 
For several years, I've been asked numerous times what Cabot plans to do with its anticipated cash flow outside of reinvesting in our current high-level operating areas and returning cash to shareholders. As you may suspect, I have received a plethora of ideas from many different circles. The Cabot team has worked overtime, evaluating many plausible uses of our anticipated free cash with the objective to create long-term, sustainable value for Cabot shareholders. 
I have never deviated from this objective. Having a world-class asset as the cornerstone only enhances the challenge. Although, I might add, it is a high-class challenge. The search carries us to many areas, including bolt-on acquisitions, joint ventures, acreage trays and our only -- and our internally generated greenfield ideas. In order for these greenfield ideas to warrant consideration for capital allocation, our team participates in an exhaustive evaluation process to determine if the idea meets our objectives. 
Several examples of our objective include the cost of entry. Do we think the idea can potentially generate full-cycle returns and compete with our current portfolio? We also ask about high-quality drilling locations. Is the idea scalable and well positioned for efficient operations? What's the initial term from leasing to full-scale, efficient development? When do we get positive free cash flow? Impacts on balance sheet? Potential growth? 
So as you can see, all of these ideas have gone through our decision that we've come up with. I'm confident that Cabot's process of evaluation, risk assessment and methodology and methodical capital allocation will result in enhanced long-term value for its shareholders. As we highlighted earlier, there's a high degree of risk associated with 
[Audio Gap] 
a grassroots leasing exploration effort. However, compared to our evaluation of the acquisitions made in the M&A space and the implied first-cycle economics on those transactions, we're comfortable with the risk profile and the potential project returns of our ideas to support this grassroots effort. After all, approximately 10 years ago, we drilled our first well in our grassroots Marcellus play in Northeast Pennsylvania and we have certainly been pleased with those returns. 
With that, Phil, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

So we were indifferent regarding the commodity diversity. And looking at the areas of potential competitive landscapes and a lot of areas that we're all aware of, through an exploration effort, we evaluated every basin that is out there. We looked at actually areas that were not necessarily in traditional fairway of the key basins. But all in all, and balling all of that up, also looking and evaluating all the M&A transactions that have transpired, we did go through some data rooms and get a good feel for valuations out there in that space to be able to compare to, not only did that meet our threshold of full-cycle returns but also, did it allow for us to enhance our portfolio of projects on a go-forward spend. And as we continue to do our exploration effort -- and our guys came up with some good ideas that we felt justified further expenditure. And so when you look at our cost of entry and you look at the possible returns that we see in these 2 projects, then you look at the scale that we're comfortable with being able to develop, we are excited about where we've allocated the capital, and we're also excited about moving forward with some incremental testing.

So there's nothing unique about that level of capital allocation. When we began our effort of looking at our needs in the future to enhance shareholder value, we look at the Marcellus, and the Marcellus is such a low-capital-intensity asset, i.e. the need for the number of drilling rigs and the need for a number of frac crews to grow our production, that we knew we were going to generate a significant amount of free cash. As I mentioned, even in the most punitive realizations Cabot has had in its corporate history, in -- through 2016, we still generated free cash and grew that asset. With this infrastructure build-out that is occurring as we speak, and looking at the amount of capital necessary to fulfill all of the capacity of those new projects, it again, is not going to take near the amount of free -- near the amount of capital that we are generating, and we'll have the free cash. So the need to do something with the free cash is an obvious question because we have it. We put that slide together where we've tried to box out and include on Slide 13 the number of different considerations that we will consider with our free cash. We will touch on a number of them. We'll touch on, I think, the distribution to shareholders with some of it. We'll also allocate the necessary amount to our Marcellus to grow every opportunity that we get. But again, it doesn't take much capital. And you could see by maintaining 3.7 Bcf flat for 25 years, we don't get much over $500 million, $600 million. So the free cash is there. We could do all these things that we're talking about. One of the ideas that every company that is in our space, E&P space, every company out there -- and you can look at the hierarchy of valuations and those that you, in your portfolio, you recognize those companies that have significant value and have the opportunity to grow. You give them better multiples and more consideration and valuations and future valuations than you do those that do not grow. Again, we're not in the business to burn capital. We thought we could make an entry into new areas, take a cost-effective look at our opportunity to find new return projects that exceed -- compete with or exceed what we're allocating capital to right now. And if we are successful in that endeavor, I think Cabot shareholders are going to be rewarded handsomely for the decision."

We were growing this company and anticipate further growth, certainly once the infrastructure gets in place.

We've got a very active program on market development up there. We've explored a lot of opportunities. We continue to think that having dependable, reliable reserves and the optionality that we have with our infrastructure up there, our gathering infrastructure, gives us a lot of advantages in moving gas to different markets and during different time periods. We went to a number of expansions on the gathering system with our partnership with Williams, and we've really created a unique opportunity for Cabot in allowing our gas to have access to multiple markets, even on a daily basis. We've tested this concept. We're able to move gas between pipes to take advantage of pricing, but also just to take advantage of capturing market share when a pipeline goes underutilized. We do expect though longer term, and even as we move in to early 2018 to mid-2018, as our power plants get ready for service and the Atlantic Sunrise project and even further out a little bit, PennEast, we expect to see a lot of flowing gas that's currently on our 3 major pipelines that fill the capacity that some producer shippers and market shippers have purchased on these new projects. We think that's going to free up some capacity in the existing pipeline infrastructure, and we'll be able to grow some market share, particularly on the pipes that we do business with our customers on a daily basis. So I guess we're teeing it up to take advantage of what we've participated in, in terms of commitments of FT and the power generators. But we also think there's a unique opportunity to grow our market share based on what we see on the activity level with our peers and how we perceive the basin fulfilling the new capacity in the next 18 to 24 months."

We can re tool and we can check and see if we paid the phone bill, please. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for t",1737,"All right. We can re tool and we can check and see if we paid the phone bill, please. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production growth coupled with an increase in Marcellus cash margins of almost [indiscernible] percent were the primary drivers for our strong cash flow growth year-over-year. 
Year-to-date results further highlight what our high-quality asset base is capable of delivering, including the generation of $123 million of positive free cash flow despite realizations of an average price of about $2.50 for natural gas and $45 for oil. This positive free cash flow is net of the capital we utilized during the first half of the year to invest in growing our year-to-date production volumes by 10% year-over-year, to contribute to our equity ownership interest in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution Pipeline projects and to fund our grassroots leasing efforts at our two exploratory ventures, all of which provide us with an optionality to create value for our shareholders. Of the $123 million of positive free cash flow, we have returned $100 million to the shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 150% and repurchased 3 million shares at an average share price of $22.41. 
As I've reiterated over the past few quarters, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders while generating double-digit returns-focused growth for the foreseeable future. And I believe our actions during the quarter demonstrate that commitment. We will continue to focus on increasing our return of capital to shareholders as we gain moral conviction in the timing of our new infrastructure and power plant projects and our [ results ] ability to execute on our robust growth plans over the coming year. 
I would highlight that when I mention robust growth in the future, I am referring not only to production growth but also growth in free cash flow. While many of our industry peers are highlighting the ability to generate double-digit production growth within cash flow a few years from now at commodity price assumptions that are higher than the current strip, we are already delivering on this plan today. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve as we exited the second quarter with a net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDAX ratio of 1.1x, which is in line with our long-term target as we continue to manage our business around maintaining an investment grade-like balance sheet. We continue to maintain over $500 million of cash on-hand and have approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments under our credit facility. This [indiscernible] liquidity allows us flexibility in the volatility -- in the volatile environment as we assess all opportunities to create value for our shareholders and manage risk. 
In this morning's release, we also reaffirmed our production growth, unit costs and capital guidance for the year despite a small sequential decline implied by our third quarter guidance due primarily to mechanical issues at a third-party compressor that will likely continue until late August. We are very confident of being able to achieve our full year production targets. 
To illustrate this point of view, we're to hold the midpoint of our guidance flat in the fourth quarter. We would hit the midpoint of our 8% to 12% full year production guidance range. However, our current intent is to grow our volume sequentially in the fourth quarter based on our price expectations. Additionally, we are still targeting a 15% to 25% of returns focused growth in 2018, which will ultimately be dependent on the timing of infrastructure projects throughout the year. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter in the Marcellus. Our volumes for the second quarter were essentially flat to our first quarter volumes, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. We brought online only 6 wells as we had planned to do. Our Marcellus price expectations and realizations remained strong during the second quarter, increasing approximately 50% year-over-year. While we are forecasting a slight widening of base [indiscernible] the third quarter, based on the current strip, we anticipate that fourth quarter differentials will revert back to levels similar to the first quarter of this year before significantly improving in the first quarter of '18. 
This anticipated improvement is driven by the potential for approximately 6 Bcf per day of new takeaway capacity to be placed in service throughout the basin between now and the end of the first quarter. 
On the well productivity front, we continue to see positive momentum driven by the results of our Gen 4 wells. Year-to-date, we have placed 26 Gen 4 wells on [indiscernible] and the average production per lateral foot continues to outperform our 4.4 industry-leading Bcf per 1,000 feet type curve. 
We recently implemented a pilot program to test a new completion design that is focused on reducing our overall completion cost, highlighting our ongoing effort to identify new efficiency gains and to mitigate potential well cost inflation in the future. 
In the Eagle Ford, we grew our daily oil production by 9% sequentially during the quarter despite a few operational delays, most of which were outside our control. Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, our long lateral wells are taking a little longer to clean up and reach peak production levels which has caused us to adjust our timing of the estimated production profiles for these wells. However, the overall estimated recoveries from these wells on a per lateral foot basis has not changed given that our longer lateral wells ultimately catch up to the type curve within a few months of production and have demonstrated a shallower decline. 
On the cost front, we realized another 9% decrease in our Eagle Ford cost -- drilling cost per foot relative to the first quarter, driven by faster drill times, for which the cost savings has helped us offset the incremental completion cost associated with the higher density completion. We have of [ honestly ] experienced a weakening in the outlook for oil prices since our first quarter call which puts pressure on all oil projects including returns in our Eagle Ford despite continued improvement in our operating efficiencies. 
Our current plan is to continue to execute on our program for the remainder of the year given that most of the capital we are allocating in the Eagle Ford during the second half the year is committed to or related to leasehold maintenance obligations. However, as we've began formulating our plans for '18, I want to reiterate that we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We evaluated all of our opportunities and we continue to evaluate all our opportunities to create value for shareholders in a sub $50 oil price environment, allocating any incremental capital to the Eagle Ford above what is needed to hold production flat and to maintain leasehold likely falls behind our superior returns in the Marcellus acceleration program and returning cash to shareholders in the [indiscernible]. 
Infrastructure. Atlantic Sunrise remains on schedule for a potential start, construction start date beginning this quarter. As most of you are aware, we filed our final PADEP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit application back in May, late May. We are now planning to receive both of these permits by late August, which will likely result in a mid to late September construction start. I also want to highlight that the Chapter 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permits are unrelated and will not necessarily be issued in any particular order. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, the expectation remains for the pipeline to be in full service by mid-'18. We feel very confident in the timing of our remaining projects given that the TGP [indiscernible] is now expected to be placed in service in December which is significantly ahead of the original schedule. While our 2 power plant projects, Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Center are currently under construction and on schedule. 
Also, a short update on Constitution. As there's been a few interesting Constitution-related data points regarding similar projects that have also been denied permits or delayed by the New York DEC. We continue to await the outcome for Constitution appeal in the second circuit court which we'll likely see some movement during the third quarter. In the meantime, Constitution operator continues to assess various legal strategies in addition to our ongoing appeal. Williams has recently been vocal regarding their ongoing dialogue with the current administration surrounding our options on this project. We will continue to monitor this process. But we feel more optimistic about this project at -- and becoming online in the next few years than we did say a year ago. 
A brief comment on the exploration front. The exploration effort is on schedule with our program. We have amassed a similar level of net acreage as our Eagle Ford footprint in one of our prospects which is located in Texas. We have also secured a significant amount of acreage on our second prospect. The plan is to -- on the -- the plan is to drill and evaluate the prospects with 5 wells between now and the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to remain within our budget of $125 million for all of this effort. This effort does not deter from, in any way, our laser focus on generating our superior returns from our Marcellus operation. 
In summary, based on our increasing confidence and the timing of the infrastructure build out in Appalachia, coupled with our deep inventory of high-return drilling locations, we believe that we can execute on a program that will provide double-digit returns focused production growth while generating free cash flow, further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position, improve our unit cost and margins, drive further improvements in capital efficiency, delivers an improving return on capital employed, and returns an increasing amount of cash to shareholders, all while assuming commodity prices that are no higher than today's strip. There are not many companies that can support a bullet point list similar to this. 
With that, Rocco, I'll be happy to answer any questions"

And quite frankly, a lot of them were positive. And right now, the DEP is sorting through those comments, preparing answers and finalizing the last [indiscernible] of that request from questions that may have come up during that comment period. We were expecting, going forward, that these permits are just getting the final touches put through them so to speak. And they will be out the door here mid to late August."

We think that can be an incremental gain. We do know that there is committed to firm capacity in the infrastructure up there that might not be filled by those holders of that firm that also provides an avenue for future growth up there also. So between now and 2020, compared to where Cabot has been on the last 3 years, just trying to battle the regulators and the anti-group trying to stop pipeline from being installed, I am extremely optimistic about the near-term for Cabot.

And certainly, in the event we then do get improvements in the commodity price that either way, whether we decide to allocate additional capital to it or if we decide to monetize, in either case, we want to maintain and keep all of our optionality in it. And so the bench point is what kind of lease requirements do we need to complete, to maintain that full leasehold position. So when you look at our entire program, we have -- we are running dual tracks here. We're looking at our return profile with every dollar we spend and I understand the angst with shareholders on why are you allocating money to a project that is not returning the superior returns, that may be a Marcellus would. But again, there's a lot of capital in the industry being allocated that don't return what the Marcellus does. And I think though that when we move forward with our exploratory projects, we do increase our optionality with infrastructure buildout. It gives us the ability to be a little bit more aggressive,  if you will, in the decisions we make on where you want to allocate, how we want to allocate, what we want to monetize and do we have some other options to maybe create additional new venture projects that need a threshold definition, as we would say, as a core asset for us. So we are really running some dual tracks right now with -- and still trying to maintain our acreage position in the Eagle Ford. And the team has done a great job and that has allowed us to, again, continue to get the returns we want. But everybody is wanting to have a program that would generate greater returns from the cost of capital."

But their returns, if that is where you are strictly focused, would allow for, even though less returns than the Marcellus, would still allow for growth and return of free cash. And that is somewhere in between, which I have not defined, between our Eagle Ford and our Marcellus. So there is a swap in between there. Obviously, on the upper end, that says, yes, these will be core projects. And you're right in your assessment. How you define a core and looking at the number of companies that are able to spend the money, drill the wells, complete them, put them in the pipeline, grow double digits and generate free cash and give free cash back to shareholders, there's not many that fall in that definition. But that definition is, I think, somewhat below what our Marcellus return is. But it is a very, very high bar to get to. And that's what we're trying to do. We recognize that if you go, just like the comments we've made on the Eagle Ford, some would say that why are you spending money in the Eagle Ford, don't spend it all in the Marcellus because you're diluting your return profile. We get the math. The difference is that that has not deterred from anything we've done in the Marcellus. We've been handicapped without infrastructure up there. We think we're getting close to that. We don't think anything we are doing in these 2 projects to try to determine, can we find a really, really good another return project to get some of our capital allocation. It will not impact $1 that we plan to allocate to our Marcellus and our anticipation of filling all incrementally the infrastructure volumes that we're going to grow too, in the Marcellus. But we are -- and to the point that may be another question referred to, how do we balance getting back to shareholders as opposed to investing into an -- or a gas well, well, we've decided to give some back to shareholders right now because we don't have a place that is going to allow us to meet our benchmark, growing and generating free cash after you do the full cycle return profile of a project. And if we get to the point that we would hope to get and I might add that in our initial economics that we run to make the first decisions to spend capital, to look for those type of ideas, we certainly have economics and a development plan in scope, though speculative, that would do what I'm talking about.

Our production growth f",1716,"Okay. all right. We can retool. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card, highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production growth, coupled with an increase in Marcellus cash margins of almost 100%, were the primary drivers for our strong cash flow growth year-over-year. 
Our year-to-date results further highlight what our high-quality asset base is capable of delivering, including the generation of $123 million of positive free cash flow despite realizations of an average price of about $2.50 for natural gas and $45 for oil. This positive free cash flow is net of the capital we utilized during the first half of the year to invest in growing our year-to-date production volumes by 10% year-over-year, to contribute to our equity ownership interest in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution Pipeline projects and to fund our grassroots-leasing efforts in our 2 exploratory ventures, all of which provide us with optionality to create value for our shareholders. Of the $123 million of positive free cash flow, we have returned $100 million to the shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 150% and repurchased 3 million shares at an average share price of $22.41. 
As I've reiterated over the past few quarters, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders while generating double-digit, returns-focused growth for the foreseeable future. And I believe our actions during the quarter demonstrate that commitment. We will continue to focus on increasing our return of capital to shareholders as we gain more conviction in the timing of our new infrastructure and power plant projects and our resultant ability to execute on our robust growth plans over the coming year. 
I would highlight that when I mention robust growth in the future, I am referring not only to production growth but also growth in free cash flow. While many of our industry peers are highlighting the ability to generate double-digit production growth within cash flow a few years from now at commodity price assumptions that are higher than the current strip, we are already delivering on this plan today. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve as we exited the second quarter with a net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDAX ratio of 1.1x, which is in line with our long-term target as we continue to manage our business around maintaining an investment grade-like balance sheet. We continue to maintain over $500 million of cash on hand and have approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments under our credit facility. This liquidity allows us flexibility in the volatility -- in the volatile environment as we assess all opportunities to create value for our shareholders and manage risk. 
In this morning's release, we also reaffirmed our production growth, unit costs and capital guidance for the year despite a small sequential decline implied by our third quarter guidance due primarily to mechanical issues at a third-party compressor that will likely continue until late August. We are very confident of being able to achieve our full year production targets. 
To illustrate this point, if you were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat in the fourth quarter, we would hit the midpoint of our 8% to 12% full year production guidance range. However, our current intent is to grow our volume sequentially in the fourth quarter based on our price expectations. Additionally, we are still targeting a 15% to 25% of returns-focused growth in 2018, which will ultimately be dependent on the timing of infrastructure projects throughout the year. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter in the Marcellus. Our volumes for the second quarter were essentially flat to our first quarter volumes, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. We brought online only 6 wells as we had planned to do. Our Marcellus price expectations and realizations remained strong during the second quarter, increasing approximately 50% year-over-year. While we are forecasting a slight widening of basis steering in the third quarter, based on the current strip, we anticipate that fourth quarter differentials will revert back to levels similar to the first quarter of this year before significantly improving in the first quarter of '18. This anticipated improvement is driven by the potential for approximately 6 Bcf per day of new takeaway capacity to be placed in service throughout the basin between now and the end of the first quarter. 
On the well productivity front, we continue to see positive momentum, driven by the results of our Gen 4 wells. Year-to-date, we have placed 26 Gen 4 wells on production and the average production per lateral foot continues to outperform our 4.4 industry-leading Bcf per thousand feet type curve. We recently implemented a pilot program to test a new completion design that is focused on reducing our overall completion cost, highlighting our ongoing effort to identify new efficiency gains and to mitigate potential well cost inflation in the future. 
In our Eagle Ford, we grew our daily oil production by 9% sequentially during the quarter despite a few operational delays, most of which were outside our control. Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, our long lateral wells are taking a little longer to clean up and reach peak production levels, which has caused us to adjust our timing of the estimated production profiles for these wells. However, the overall estimated recoveries from these wells on a per lateral foot basis has not changed, given that our longer lateral wells ultimately catch up to the type curve within a few months of production and have demonstrated a shallower decline. 
On the cost front, we realized another 9% decrease in our Eagle Ford cost -- drilling cost per foot relative to the first quarter, driven by faster drill times, for which the cost savings has helped us offset the incremental completion cost associated with the higher-density completions. We have obviously experienced a weakening in the outlook for oil prices since our first quarter call, which puts pressure on all oil projects, including returns in our Eagle Ford, despite continued improvement in our operating efficiencies. 
Our current plan is to continue to execute on our program for the remainder of the year, given that most of the capital we are allocating in the Eagle Ford during the second half the year is committed to or related to leasehold maintenance obligations. However, as we've began formulating our plans for '18, I want to reiterate that we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We evaluated all of our opportunities, and we continue to evaluate all our opportunities to create value for shareholders in a sub-$50 oil price environment. Allocating any incremental capital to the Eagle Ford above what is needed to hold production flat and to maintain leasehold likely falls behind our superior returns in the Marcellus acceleration program and returning cash to shareholders in the pecking order. 
Infrastructure. Atlantic Sunrise remains on schedule for a potential start -- construction start date beginning this quarter. As most of you are aware, we filed our final PADEP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permit application back in May, late May. We are now planning to receive both of these permits by late August, which would likely result in a mid- to late-September construction start. I also want to highlight that the Chapter 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permits are unrelated and will not necessarily be issued in any particular order. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, the expectation remains for the pipeline to be in full service by mid-'18. We feel very confident in the timing of our remaining projects, given that the TGP Orion is now expected to be placed in service in December, which is significantly ahead of the original schedule, while our 2 power plant projects, Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule. 
Also, a short update on Constitution, as there's been a few interesting Constitution-related data points regarding similar projects that have also been denied permits or delayed by the New York DEC. We continue to await the outcome from Constitution appeal in the Second Circuit court, which will likely see some movement during the third quarter. In the meantime, the Constitution operator continues to assess various legal strategies in addition to our ongoing appeal. Williams has recently been vocal regarding their ongoing dialogue with the current administration surrounding our options on this project. We will continue to monitor this process. But we feel more optimistic about this project at -- and becoming online in the next few years than we did, say, a year ago. 
A brief comment on the exploration front. The exploration effort is on schedule with our program. We have amassed a similar level of net acreage as our Eagle Ford footprint in one of our prospects, which is located in Texas. We have also secured a significant amount of acreage on our second prospect. The plan is to -- on the -- the plan is to drill and evaluate the prospects with 5 wells between now and the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to remain within our budget of $125 million for all of this effort. This effort does not deter from, in any way, our laser focus on generating our superior returns from our Marcellus operation. 
In summary, based on our increasing confidence and the timing of the infrastructure build-out in Appalachia, coupled with our deep inventory of high-return drilling locations, we believe that we can execute on a program that will provide double-digit, returns-focused production growth while generating free cash flow, further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position, improve our unit cost and margins, drive further improvements in capital efficiency, delivers an improving return on capital employed, and returns an increasing amount of cash to shareholders, all while assuming commodity prices that are no higher than today's strip. There are not many companies that can support a bullet point list similar to this. 
With that, Rocco, I'll be happy to answer any questions"

But our idea is to always improve our lie and to improve our capital efficiency. We believe that the best areas to allocate capital are in core areas, and I would define core areas are -- as like our Marcellus. And there are probably are several others maybe very core areas in the oil areas that would allow capital to be allocated, returns that would generate, not only growth, but also free cash. Our objective is to try to improve our lie over any areas, like our Eagle Ford, that I do not -- it's a good asset, certainly we're running, even at these lower-threshold commodity prices, our weighted average cost of capital. But I don't believe the company survives on just drilling areas that have a return profile based on the weighted cost of capital. So our objective would be to improve our lie and be able to do it in a way that would return, not only significant returns-focused growth, but also free cash, which would in fact allow us to generate more free cash to give back to shareholders. So that's our objective. If we were on your fail case or uncertain case, if we were to not be able to get to a core asset profile with our exploration program, and then, though we saw that our infrastructure projects we're taking off of the Marcellus, we decided to go in that direction solely as an ongoing project, which by the way, is a high-class problem to have with those assets, if we made that decision, I am confident with the subsurface data we have, with the concept design we've created, that there is going to be incremental value in these assets, in these 2 projects. And if, in fact, they were not core-type projects for us, I'd still think that with the dollars invested, entry level at a very, very low cost, that we would be able to generate significant returns for the shareholder if, in fact, we decided to monetize those assets."

And certainly, in the event that we do get improvements in the commodity price, that either way, whether we decide to allocate additional capital to it or if we decide to monetize, in either case, we want to maintain and keep all of our optionality and -- in it. And so the pinch point is, what kind of lease requirements that we need to complete, to maintain that full leasehold position. So when you look at our entire program, we have -- we're running dual tracks here. We're looking at our return profile with every dollar we spend, and I understand the angst with shareholders on why are you allocating money to a project that is not returning the superior returns, that maybe a Marcellus would. But again, there's a lot of capital in the industry being allocated that don't return what the Marcellus does. And I think, though, that when we move forward with our exploratory projects, we do increase our optionality with infrastructure build-out. It gives us the ability to be a little bit more aggressive, if you will, in the decisions we make on where you want to allocate, how we want to allocate, what we want to monetize, and do we have some other options to maybe create additional new venture projects that need a threshold definition, as we would say, as a core asset for us. So we're really running some dual tracks right now with -- and still trying to maintain our acreage position in the Eagle Ford. And the team has done a great job. That has allowed us to, again, continue to get the returns we want. But everybody is wanting to have a program that would generate greater returns from the cost of capital."

I know you've laid out the Eagle Ford as 45% project return at $50 and Marcellus Shale is 120% at $2. I would imagine it's somewhere in between there. What's kind of your ballpark rule of thumb?

So a combination of, again, seeing good realizations that we hadn't seen in maybe 3 years come to fruition, but also, to your point, getting closer to the approval process and narrowing down on the commissioning of these infrastructures. Both of those gave us the confidence to not only increase our dividend by 150%, but also to do the share repurchases that we've made. And Scott's point was made about we have a reauthorization still of 7 million shares. And yes, we're going to be opportunistic.

Thanks for the question. We talk about this quite a bit in preparing for a good, little while now, since we've known that Sunrise was going to be slightly delayed, on what is the best path on getting Susquehanna County gas down to the Cove Point pipeline. We currently own existing capacity to get some of that gas down to the Cove Point pipeline. We're contracting with a few others that have paths leading to Susquehanna County to get additional volumes down to Cove Point. We have some other options with capacity holders that have valid paths to feed our gathering system that run past the Cove Point pipeline. So we're working out the arrangements with them as we speak. We're looking at this from a variety of angles. For example, we're still not entirely sure when Cove Point will be up and running. We're taking on the best case that they'll be up in January, which fits us rather nicely.

Marshall, I don't put the core definition as only what our return is in the Marcellus. There are some areas out there that I think have core -- what I would define as core returns that might not be the returns of the Marcellus. But their returns, if that was where you're strictly focused, would allow for, even though less returns than the Marcellus, would still allow for growth and return of free cash. And that is somewhere in between, which I have not defined, between our Eagle Ford and our Marcellus. So there is a swap in between there. Obviously, on the upper end, that says, yes, these would be core projects. And you're right in your assessment. How you define a core and looking at the number of companies that are able to spend the money, drill the wells, complete them, put them in the pipeline, grow double digits and generate free cash and give free cash back to shareholders, there's not many that fall in that definition. But that definition is, I think, somewhat below what our Marcellus return is, but it is a very, very high bar to get to. And that's what we're trying to do. We recognize that if you go -- just like the comments we've made on the Eagle Ford, some would say that, ""Why are you spending money in the Eagle Ford? Go spend it all in the Marcellus, because you're diluting your return profile."" We get the math. The difference is that, that has not deterred from anything we've done in the Marcellus. We've been handicapped without infrastructure up there. We think we're getting close to that. We don't think anything we're doing in these 2 projects to try to determine, can we find a really, really good -- another return project to get -- some of our capital allocation. It will not impact $1 that we plan to allocate to our Marcellus and our anticipation of filling, all incrementally, the infrastructure volumes that we're going to grow, too, in the Marcellus. But what we are -- and to the point that maybe another question referred to, how do we balance giving back to shareholders as opposed to investing into a -- or a gas well. Well, we've decided to give some back to shareholders right now because we don't have a place that is going to allow us to meet our benchmark, growing and generating free cash after you do the full-cycle return profile of our projects. And if we get to the point that we would hope to get -- and I might add that in our initial economics that we run to make the first decisions to spend capital, to look for those type of ideas, we certainly have economics and a development plan in scope, though speculative, that would do what I'm talking about. And that is invest, develop, have a development program, get to the point of growth where free cash -- the program is supporting on its own cash generation and also generating free cash for other optionality and as we have suggested and as we have done, and that is to get back to shareholders."

Would you check and see if we pay phone bill, please. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card, highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for",1728,"Okay. All right. We can retool. Would you check and see if we pay phone bill, please. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card, highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production growth, coupled with an increase in Marcellus cash margins of almost 100%, were the primary drivers for our strong cash flow growth year-over-year. 
Our year-to-date results further highlight what our high-quality asset base is capable of delivering, including the generation of $123 million of positive free cash flow despite realizations of an average price of about $2.50 for natural gas and $45 for oil. This positive free cash flow is net of the capital we utilized during the first half of the year to invest in growing our year-to-date production volumes by 10% year-over-year, to contribute to our equity ownership interest in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution Pipeline projects and to fund our grassroots-leasing efforts in our two exploratory ventures, all of which provide us with optionality to create value for our shareholders. Of the $123 million of positive free cash flow, we have returned $100 million to the shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 150% and repurchased 3 million shares at an average share price of $22.41. 
As I've reiterated over the past few quarters, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders while generating double-digit, returns-focused growth for the foreseeable future. And I believe our actions during the quarter demonstrate that commitment. We will continue to focus on increasing our return of capital to shareholders as we gain more conviction in the timing of our new infrastructure and power plant projects and our resultant ability to execute on our robust growth plans over the coming year. 
I would highlight that when I mention robust growth in the future, I am referring not only to production growth but also growth in free cash flow. While many of our industry peers are highlighting the ability to generate double-digit production growth within cash flow a few years from now at commodity price assumptions that are higher than the current strip, we are already delivering on this plan today. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve as we exited the second quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX ratio of 1.1x, which is in line with our long-term target as we continue to manage our business around maintaining an investment grade-like balance sheet. We continue to maintain over $500 million of cash on hand and have approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments under our credit facility. This little liquidity allows us flexibility in the volatility -- in the volatile environment as we assess all opportunities to create value for our shareholders and manage risk. 
In this morning's release, we also reaffirmed our production growth, unit costs and capital guidance for the year despite a small sequential decline implied by our third quarter guidance due primarily to mechanical issues at a third-party compressor that will likely continue until late August. We are very confident of being able to achieve our full year production targets. 
To illustrate this point, if you were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat in the fourth quarter, we would hit the midpoint of our 8% to 12% full year production guidance range. However, our current intent is to grow our volume sequentially in the fourth quarter based on our price expectations. Additionally, we are still targeting a 15% to 25% of returns-focused growth in 2018, which will ultimately be dependent on the timing of infrastructure projects throughout the year. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter in the Marcellus. Our volumes for the second quarter were essentially flat to our first quarter volumes, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. We brought online only 6 wells as we had planned to do. Our Marcellus price expectations and realizations remained strong during the second quarter, increasing approximately 50% year-over-year. While we are forecasting a slight widening of basis steering in the third quarter, based on the current strip, we anticipate that fourth quarter differentials will revert back to levels similar to the first quarter of this year before significantly improving in the first quarter of '18. This anticipated improvement is driven by the potential for approximately 6 Bcf per day of new takeaway capacity to be placed in service throughout the basin between now and the end of the first quarter. 
On the well productivity front, we continue to see positive momentum, driven by the results of our Gen 4 wells. Year-to-date, we have placed 26 Gen 4 wells on production and the average production per lateral foot continues to outperform our 4.4 industry-leading Bcf per 1000 feet type curve. We recently implemented a pilot program to test a new completion design that is focused on reducing our overall completion cost, highlighting our ongoing effort to identify new efficiency gains and to mitigate potential well cost inflation in the future. 
In our Eagle Ford, we grew our daily oil production by 9% sequentially during the quarter despite a few operational delays, most of which were outside our control. Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, our long lateral wells are taking a little longer to clean up and reach peak production levels, which has caused us to adjust our timing of the estimated production profiles for these wells. However, the overall estimated recoveries from these wells on a per lateral foot basis has not changed, given that our longer lateral wells ultimately catch up to the type curve within a few months of production and have demonstrated a shallower decline. 
On the cost front, we realized another 9% decrease in our Eagle Ford cost -- drilling cost per foot relative to the first quarter, driven by faster drill times, for which the cost savings has helped us offset the incremental completion cost associated with the higher-density completions. We have obviously experienced a weakening in the outlook for oil prices since our first quarter call, which puts pressure on all oil projects, including returns in our Eagle Ford, despite continued improvement in our operating efficiencies. 
Our current plan is to continue to execute on our program for the remainder of the year, given that most of the capital we are allocating in the Eagle Ford during the second half the year is committed to or related to leasehold maintenance obligations. However, as we've began formulating our plans for '18, I want to reiterate that we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We evaluated all of our opportunities, and we continue to evaluate all our opportunities to create value for shareholders in a sub-$50 oil price environment. Allocating any incremental capital to the Eagle Ford above what is needed to hold production flat and to maintain leasehold likely falls behind our superior returns in the Marcellus acceleration program and returning cash to shareholders in the pecking order. 
Infrastructure. Atlantic Sunrise remains on schedule for a potential start -- construction start date beginning this quarter. As most of you are aware, we filed our final PADEP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permit application back in May, late May. We are now planning to receive both of these permits by late August, which would likely result in a mid- to late-September construction start. I also want to highlight that the Chapter 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permits are unrelated and will not necessarily be issued in any particular order. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, the expectation remains for the pipeline to be in full service by mid '18. We feel very confident in the timing of our remaining projects, given that the TGP Orion is now expected to be placed in service in December, which is significantly ahead of the original schedule, while our 2 power plant projects, Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule. 
Also, a short update on Constitution, as there's been a few interesting Constitution-related data points regarding similar projects that have also been denied permits or delayed by the New York DEC. We continue to await the outcome from Constitution appeal in the Second Circuit court, which will likely see some movement during the third quarter. In the meantime, Constitution operator continues to assess various legal strategies in addition to our ongoing appeal. Williams has recently been vocal regarding their ongoing dialogue with the current administration surrounding our options on this project. We will continue to monitor this process. But we feel more optimistic about this project at -- and becoming online in the next few years than we did, say, a year ago. 
A brief comment on the exploration front. The exploration effort is on schedule with our program. We have amassed a similar level of net acreage as our Eagle Ford footprint in one of our prospects, which is located in Texas. We have also secured a significant amount of acreage on our second prospect. The plan is to -- on the -- the plan is to drill and evaluate the prospects with 5 wells between now and the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to remain within our budget of $125 million for all of this effort. This effort does not deter from, in any way, our laser focus on generating our superior returns from our Marcellus operation. 
In summary, based on our increasing confidence and the timing of the infrastructure build-out in Appalachia, coupled with our deep inventory of high-return drilling locations, we believe that we can execute on a program that will provide double-digit, returns-focused production growth while generating free cash flow, further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position, improve our unit cost and margins, drive further improvements in capital efficiency, delivers an improving return on capital employed, and returns an increasing amount of cash to shareholders, all while assuming commodity prices that are no higher than today's strip. There are not many companies that can support a bullet point list similar to this. 
With that, Rocco, I'll be happy to answer any questions"

We do know that there is committed-to-firm capacity in the infrastructure up there that might not be filled by those holders of that firm that also provides an avenue for future growth up there also.

So from timing, Brian, on when we might have something solid, I really think it would be after the first of the year.

We could give you return profiles. We could even look at the quality of fluid mix to talk a little bit more in-depth about what it's going to take on the surface side of the business and infrastructure side and give assurances that we've mitigated risk on program execution from logistics.

But our idea is to always improve our lie and to improve our capital efficiency. We believe that the best areas to allocate capital are in core areas, and I would define core areas are -- as like our Marcellus. And there are probably are several others maybe very core areas in the oil areas that would allow capital to be allocated, returns that would generate, not only growth, but also free cash. Our objective is to try to improve our lie over any areas, like our Eagle Ford, that I do not -- it's a good asset, certainly we're running, even at these lower-threshold commodity prices, our weighted average cost of capital. But I don't believe the company survives on just drilling areas that have a return profile based on the weighted cost of capital. So our objective would be to improve our lie and be able to do it in a way that would return, not only significant returns-focused growth, but also free cash, which would in fact allow us to generate more free cash to give back to shareholders. 
So that's our objective. If we were on your fail case or uncertain case, if we were to not be able to get to a core asset profile with our exploration program, and then, though we saw that our infrastructure projects we're taking off of the Marcellus, we decided to go in that direction solely as an ongoing project, which by the way, is a high-class problem to have with those assets, if we made that decision, I am confident with the subsurface data we have, with the concept design we've created, that there is going to be incremental value in these assets, in these 2 projects. And if, in fact, they were not core-type projects for us, I'd still think that with the dollars invested, entry level at a very, very low cost, that we would be able to generate significant returns for the shareholder if, in fact, we decided to monetize those assets."

And certainly, in the event that we do get improvements in the commodity price, that either way, whether we decide to allocate additional capital to it or if we decide to monetize, in either case, we want to maintain and keep all of our optionality and -- in it. And so the pinch point is, what kind of lease requirements that we need to complete, to maintain that full leasehold position. 
So when you look at our entire program, we have -- we're running dual tracks here. We're looking at our return profile with every dollar we spend, and I understand the angst with shareholders on, why are you allocating money to a project that is not returning the superior returns, that maybe a Marcellus would. But again, there's a lot of capital in the industry being allocated that don't return what the Marcellus does. And I think, though, that when we move forward with our exploratory projects, we do increase our optionality with infrastructure build-out. It gives us the ability to be a little bit more aggressive, if you will, in the decisions we make on where you want to allocate, how we want to allocate, what we want to monetize, and do we have some other options to maybe create additional new venture projects that need a threshold definition, as we would say, as a core asset for us. 
So we're really running some dual tracks right now with -- and still trying to maintain our acreage position in the Eagle Ford. And the team has done a great job. That has allowed us to, again, continue to get the returns we want. But everybody is wanting to have a program that would generate greater returns from the cost of capital."

We're contracting with a few others that have path leading Susquehanna County to get additional volumes down the Cove Point. We have some other options with capacity holders that have valid path to feed our gathering system that run past the Cove Point pipeline. So we're working out the arrangements with them as we speak. We're looking at this from a variety of angles. For example, we're still not entirely sure when Cove Point will be up and running.

Marshall, I don't put the core definition as only what our return is in the Marcellus. There are some areas out there that I think have core -- what I would define as core returns that might not be the returns of the Marcellus. But their returns, if that was where you are strictly focused, would allow for -- even though less returns than the Marcellus, would still allow for growth and return of free cash. And that is somewhere in between, which I have not defined, between our Eagle Ford and our Marcellus. 
So there is a swap in between there. Obviously, on the upper end, that says, yes, these would be core projects. And you're right in your assessment. How you define a core and looking at the number of companies that are able to spend the money, drill the wells, complete them, put them in the pipeline, grow double digits and generate free cash and give free cash back to shareholders, there's not many that fall in that definition.  But that definition is, I think, somewhat below what our Marcellus return is, but it is a very, very high bar to get to. 
And that's what we're trying to do. We recognize that if you go -- just like the comments we've made on the Eagle Ford, some would say that, ""Why are you spending money in the Eagle Ford? Go spend it all in the Marcellus, because you're diluting your return profile."" We get the math. The difference is that, that has not deterred from anything we've done in the Marcellus. We've been handicapped without infrastructure up there. We think we're getting close to that. We don't think anything we're doing in these 2 projects to try to determine, can we find a really, really good -- another return project to get -- some of our capital allocation. It will not impact $1 that we plan to allocate to our Marcellus and our anticipation of filling, all incrementally, the infrastructure volumes that we're going to grow, too, in the Marcellus. But what we are -- and to the point that maybe another question referred to, how do we balance giving back to shareholders as opposed to investing into a -- or a gas well. 
Well, we've decided to give some back to shareholders right now because we don't have a place that is going to allow us to meet our benchmark of growing and generating free cash after you do the full-cycle return profile of our projects. And if we get to the point that we would hope to get -- and I might add that in our initial economics that we run to make the first decisions to spend capital, to look for those type of ideas, we certainly have economics and a development plan in scope, though speculative, that would do what I'm talking about. And that is invest, develop, have a development program, get to the point of growth where free cash -- the program is supporting on its own cash generation and also generating free cash for other optionality and as we have suggested and as we have done, and that is to get back to shareholders."

We can retool. Would you check and see if we pay phone bill, please. For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card, highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production growth, coupled with an increase in Marcellus cash margins of almost 100%, were the primary drivers for our strong cash flow growth year-over-year. 
Our year-to-date results further highlight what our high-quality asset base is capable of delivering, including the generation of $123 million of positive free cash flow despite realizations of an average price of about $2.50 for natural gas and $45 for oil. This positive free cash flow is net of the capital we utilized during the first half of the year to invest in growing our year-to-date production volumes by 10% year-over-year, to contribute to our equity ownership interest in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution Pipeline projects and to fund our grassroots-leasing efforts in our two exploratory ventures, all of which provide us with optionality to create value for our shareholders. Of the $123 million of positive free cash flow, we have returned $100 million to the shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 150% and repurchased 3 million shares at an average share price of $22.41. 
As I've reiterated over the past few quarters, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders while generating double-digit, returns-focused growth for the foreseeable future. And I believe our actions during the quarter demonstrate that commitment. We will continue to focus on increasing our return of capital to shareholders as we gain more conviction in the timing of our new infrastructure and power plant projects and our resultant ability to execute on our robust growth plans over the coming year. 
I would highlight that when I mention robust growth in the future, I am referring not only to production growth but also growth in free cash flow. While many of our industry peers are highlighting the ability to generate double-digit production growth within cash flow a few years from now at commodity price assumptions that are higher than the current strip, we are already delivering on this plan today. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve as we exited the second quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX ratio of 1.1x, which is in line with our long-term target as we continue to manage our business around maintaining an investment grade-like balance sheet. We continue to maintain over $500 million of cash on hand and have approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments under our credit facility. This little liquidity allows us flexibility in the volatility -- in the volatile environment as we assess all opportunities to create value for our shareholders and manage risk. 
In this morning's release, we also reaffirmed our production growth, unit costs and capital guidance for the year despite a small sequential decline implied by our third quarter guidance due primarily to mechanical issues at a third-party compressor that will likely continue until late August. We are very confident of being able to achieve our full year production targets. 
To illustrate this point, if you were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat in the fourth quarter, we would hit the midpoint of our 8% to 12% full year production guidance range. However, our current intent is to grow our volume sequentially in the fourth quarter based on our price expectations. Additionally, we are still targeting a 15% to 25% of returns-focused growth in 2018, which will ultimately be dependent on the timing of infrastructure projects throughout the year. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter in the Marcellus. Our volumes for the second quarter were essentially flat to our first quarter volumes, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. We brought online only 6 wells as we had planned to do. Our Marcellus price expectations and realizations remained strong during the second quarter, increasing approximately 50% year-over-year. While we are forecasting a slight widening of basis steering in the third quarter, based on the current strip, we anticipate that fourth quarter differentials will revert back to levels similar to the first quarter of this year before significantly improving in the first quarter of '18. This anticipated improvement is driven by the potential for approximately 6 Bcf per day of new takeaway capacity to be placed in service throughout the basin between now and the end of the first quarter. 
On the well productivity front, we continue to see positive momentum, driven by the results of our Gen 4 wells. Year-to-date, we have placed 26 Gen 4 wells on production and the average production per lateral foot continues to outperform our 4.4 industry-leading Bcf per 1000 feet type curve. We recently implemented a pilot program to test a new completion design that is focused on reducing our overall completion cost, highlighting our ongoing effort to identify new efficiency gains and to mitigate potential well cost inflation in the future. 
In our Eagle Ford, we grew our daily oil production by 9% sequentially during the quarter despite a few operational delays, most of which were outside our control. Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, our long lateral wells are taking a little longer to clean up and reach peak production levels, which has caused us to adjust our timing of the estimated production profiles for these wells. However, the overall estimated recoveries from these wells on a per lateral foot basis has not changed, given that our longer lateral wells ultimately catch up to the type curve within a few months of production and have demonstrated a shallower decline. 
On the cost front, we realized another 9% decrease in our Eagle Ford cost -- drilling cost per foot relative to the first quarter, driven by faster drill times, for which the cost savings has helped us offset the incremental completion cost associated with the higher-density completions. We have obviously experienced a weakening in the outlook for oil prices since our first quarter call, which puts pressure on all oil projects, including returns in our Eagle Ford, despite continued improvement in our operating efficiencies. 
Our current plan is to continue to execute on our program for the remainder of the year, given that most of the capital we are allocating in the Eagle Ford during the second half the year is committed to or related to leasehold maintenance obligations. However, as we've began formulating our plans for '18, I want to reiterate that we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We evaluated all of our opportunities, and we continue to evaluate all our opportunities to create value for shareholders in a sub-$50 oil price environment. Allocating any incremental capital to the Eagle Ford above what is needed to hold production flat and to maintain leasehold likely falls behind our superior returns in the Marcellus acceleration program and returning cash to shareholders in the pecking order. 
Infrastructure. Atlantic Sunrise remains on schedule for a potential start -- construction start date beginning this quarter. As most of you are aware, we filed our final PADEP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permit application back in May, late May. We are now planning to receive both of these permits by late August, which would likely result in a mid- to late-September construction start. I also want to highlight that the Chapter 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permits are unrelated and will not necessarily be issued in any particular order. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, the expectation remains for the pipeline to be in full service by mid '18. We feel very confident in the timing of our remaining projects, given that the TGP Orion is now expected to be placed in service in December, which is significantly ahead of the original schedule, while our 2 power plant projects, Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule. 
Also, a short update on Constitution, as there's been a few interesting Constitution-related data points regarding similar projects that have also been denied permits or delayed by the New York DEC. We continue to await the outcome from Constitution appeal in the Second Circuit court, which will likely see some movement during the third quarter. In the meantime, Constitution operator continues to assess various legal strategies in addition to our ongoing appeal. Williams has recently been vocal regarding their ongoing dialogue with the current administration surrounding our options on this project. We will continue to monitor this process. But we feel more optimistic about this project at -- and becoming online in the next few years than we did, say, a year ago. 
A brief comment on the exploration front. The exploration effort is on schedule with our program. We have amassed a similar level of net acreage as our Eagle Ford footprint in one of our prospects, which is located in Texas. We have also secured a significant amount of acreage on our second prospect. The plan is to -- on the -- the plan is to drill and evaluate the prospects with 5 wells between now and the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to remain within our budget of $125 million for all of this effort. This effort does not deter from, in any way, our laser focus on generating our superior returns from our Marcellus operation. 
In summary, based on our increasing confidence and the timing of the infrastructure build-out in Appalachia, coupled with our deep inventory of high-return drilling locations, we believe that we can execute on a program that will provide double-digit, returns-focused production growth while generating free cash flow, further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position, improve our unit cost and margins, drive further improvements in capital efficiency, delivers an improving return on capital employed, and returns an increasing amount of cash to shareholders, all while assuming commodity prices that are no higher than today's strip. There are not many companies that can support a bullet point list similar to this. 
With that, Rocco, I'll be happy to answer any questions"

With the -- going out and looking out in the Northeast and looking at the power plant projects, looking at the Atlantic Sunrise, yes, we have anticipation of Constitution also securing the approval later, whether it's 2019 or 2020. We think that can be an incremental gain. We do know that there is committed-to-firm capacity in the infrastructure up there that might not be filled by those holders of that firm that also provides an avenue for future growth up there also. 
So between now and 2020, compared to where Cabot has been on the last 3 years, just trying to battle the regulators and the anti-group trying to stop pipeline from being installed, I am extremely optimistic about the near term for Cabot.

So the data we gather continues to reinforce our concepts on both of these prospects. 
So from timing, Brian, on when we might have something solid, I really think it would be after the first of the year. Ideally, what I would love to see would be 4 or so wells in each prospect area tested, some flow back period. And with those test and flow back period, we can give you cost examples. We could give you return profiles. We could even look at the quality of fluid mix to talk a little bit more in-depth about what it's going to take on the surface side of the business and infrastructure side and give assurances that we've mitigated risk on program execution from logistics.

But our idea is to always improve our lie and to improve our capital efficiency. We believe that the best areas to allocate capital are in core areas, and I would define core areas are -- as like our Marcellus. And there are probably are several others may be very core areas in the oil areas that would allow capital to be allocated, returns that would generate, not only growth, but also free cash. Our objective is to try to improve our lie over any areas, like our Eagle Ford, that I do not -- it's a good asset, certainly we're running, even at these lower-threshold commodity prices, our weighted average cost of capital. But I don't believe the company survives on just drilling areas that have a return profile based on the weighted cost of capital. So our objective would be to improve our lie and be able to do it in a way that would return, not only significant returns-focused growth, but also free cash, which would in fact allow us to generate more free cash to give back to shareholders. 
So that's our objective. If we were on your fail case or uncertain case, if we were to not be able to get to a core asset profile with our exploration program, and then, though we saw that our infrastructure projects we're taking off of the Marcellus, we decided to go in that direction solely as an ongoing project, which by the way, is a high-class problem to have with those assets, if we made that decision, I am confident with the subsurface data we have, with the concept design we've created, that there is going to be incremental value in these assets, in these 2 projects. And if, in fact, they were not core-type projects for us, I'd still think that with the dollars invested, entry level at a very, very low cost, that we would be able to generate significant returns for the shareholder if, in fact, we decided to monetize those assets."

And certainly, in the event that we do get improvements in the commodity price, that either way, whether we decide to allocate additional capital to it or if we decide to monetize, in either case, we want to maintain and keep all of our optionality and -- in it. And so the pinch point is, what kind of lease requirements that we need to complete, to maintain that full leasehold position. 
So when you look at our entire program, we have -- we're running dual tracks here. We're looking at our return profile with every dollar we spend, and I understand the angst with shareholders on, why are you allocating money to a project that is not returning the superior returns, that maybe a Marcellus would. But again, there's a lot of capital in the industry being allocated that don't return what the Marcellus does. And I think, though, that when we move forward with our exploratory projects, we do increase our optionality with infrastructure build-out. It gives us the ability to be a little bit more aggressive, if you will, in the decisions we make on where you want to allocate, how we want to allocate, what we want to monetize, and do we have some other options to maybe create additional new venture projects that need a threshold definition, as we would say, as a core asset for us. 
So we're really running some dual tracks right now with -- and still trying to maintain our acreage position in the Eagle Ford. And the team has done a great job. That has allowed us to, again, continue to get the returns we want. But everybody is wanting to have a program that would generate greater returns from the cost of capital."

We got notified by DTE, who owns and operates the Bluestone Pipeline, which cuts through the core of Susquehanna County in our area. We were making deliveries from the station there, and they have done an inspection on a compressor station, that actually pumps gas in the Millennium Pipeline on the north end of their system. Long story short, they noticed some vibration damage to the engines and immediately shut it down, removed the engines, check out the foundation and decided that, in this particular case, the best idea going forward was simply lease 4 new engines, rebuild the station as quickly as possible and get back online. The current in-service dates we were getting now are August 23. Yes, give or take a few days. So we think we will be back in business around September 1."

We currently own existing capacity to get some of that gas down to the Cove Point pipeline. We're contracting with a few others that have path leading Susquehanna County to get additional volumes down the Cove Point. We have some other options with capacity holders that have valid path to feed our gathering system that run past the Cove Point pipeline. So we're working out the arrangements with them as we speak. We're looking at this from a variety of angles. For example, we're still not entirely sure when Cove Point will be up and running. We're taking on the best case that they'll be up in January, which fits us rather nicely. And i hope that we won't have any problem contracting for various path and cobble together enough transportation options to get our gas down to the pipeline."

There are some areas out there that I think have core -- what I would define as core returns that might not be the returns of the Marcellus. But their returns, if",536,"Yes. Marshall, I don't put the core definition as only what our return is in the Marcellus. There are some areas out there that I think have core -- what I would define as core returns that might not be the returns of the Marcellus. But their returns, if that was where you are strictly focused, would allow for -- even though less returns than the Marcellus, would still allow for growth and return of free cash. And that is somewhere in between, which I have not defined, between our Eagle Ford and our Marcellus. 
So there is a swap in between there. Obviously, on the upper end, that says, yes, these would be core projects. And you're right in your assessment. How you define a core and looking at the number of companies that are able to spend the money, drill the wells, complete them, put them in the pipeline, grow double digits and generate free cash and give free cash back to shareholders, there's not many that fall in that definition.  But that definition is, I think, somewhat below what our Marcellus return is, but it is a very, very high bar to get to. 
And that's what we're trying to do. We recognize that if you go -- just like the comments we've made on the Eagle Ford, some would say that, ""Why are you spending money in the Eagle Ford? Go spend it all in the Marcellus, because you're diluting your return profile."" We get the math. The difference is that, that has not deterred from anything we've done in the Marcellus. We've been handicapped without infrastructure up there. We think we're getting close to that. We don't think anything we're doing in these 2 projects to try to determine, can we find a really, really good -- another return project to get -- some of our capital allocation. It will not impact $1 that we plan to allocate to our Marcellus and our anticipation of filling, all incrementally, the infrastructure volumes that we're going to grow, too, in the Marcellus. But what we are -- and to the point that maybe another question referred to, how do we balance giving back to shareholders as opposed to investing into a -- or a gas well. 
Well, we've decided to give some back to shareholders right now because we don't have a place that is going to allow us to meet our benchmark of growing and generating free cash after you do the full-cycle return profile of our projects. And if we get to the point that we would hope to get -- and I might add that in our initial economics that we run to make the first decisions to spend capital, to look for those type of ideas, we certainly have economics and a development plan in scope, though speculative, that would do what I'm talking about. And that is invest, develop, have a development program, get to the point of growth where free cash -- the program is supporting on its own cash generation and also generating free cash for other optionality and as we have suggested and as we have done, and that is to get back to shareholders."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They are usually here. Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on",1800,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They are usually here. Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
For the third quarter, Cabot demonstrated its continued focus on disciplined capital allocation by generating positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter, while delivering 12% equivalent production growth. Operating cash flow increased by 79% year-over-year, driven by the production growth, coupled with a 60% increase in cash margins. On natural gas, price realizations increased 16% year-over-year. It should come as no surprise that the third quarter realizations were weaker sequentially due to lower NYMEX price and wider differentials. The widening of differentials in the third quarter has been seen in Appalachia over the last few years and highlights the need for the long anticipated in service of new long-haul infrastructure and in-basin demand projects. Our expectation is that our price realizations will only improve moving forward given the in-service of numerous infrastructure projects over the next few quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $125 million of free cash flow and received over $30 million of proceeds from noncore assets sales, which have allowed us to return almost $125 million of capital to shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases, and to reduce our net debt position, further improving our strong balance sheet. 
As it relates to share repurchase, while we did not buyback shares during the third quarter, I would highlight that we remain optimistic on this front and take advantage of disconnects in the market, like the recent 9% selloff we experienced during our recent trading blackout period, which did begin after the end of the third quarter. 
In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our capital guidance and tightened our production guidance range for the year, while leaving the midpoint unchanged, where we ended up in the production [indiscernible] where we end up in the production guidance range. We will ultimately be dependent on in-basin pricing during the fourth quarter as Cabot has recently been electing curtail a small portion of its production when pricing is value destruction. 
As we have reiterated many times before, while production is a byproduct of our capital allocation through high retain projects, we are not a chasing top line production growth for the sake of it and have absolutely no problem holding back volumes if the prices do not warrant moving additional gas at certain times. However, I'm not overly concerned about the recent price dynamics given that over the last few years, we have seen some of the widest differentials during the month of October, which has subsequently been followed by a significant improvement in basis. 
As most of you are aware, Atlantic Sunrise received its final notice to proceed during the quarter, with pipeline and compression station construction beginning in September. This is a milestone we've been waiting for since our first announcement and our involvement in the project back in February 2014, and represents a key inflection point for the Northeast Pennsylvania natural gas market and for Cabot. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service to this project on which will be selling approximately 1 Bcf of new -- of gas to new markets. Tennessee Gas Pipeline recently reaffirmed that its Orion Project is ahead of schedule and it's anticipated to be in service as early as December '17. Additionally, the 2 power plant projects that we are sole suppliers to, Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule for their early September -- or excuse me, summer 2018 in service. 
As it relates to Constitution Pipeline, the parties of these project recently submitted a petition for a declaratory order with the FERC, demonstrating that the New York DEC exceeded its statutory time frame to grant or deny the Section 401 certification for the project. The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, the certification requirement shall be waived. It is our belief that New York DEC clearly failed that on Constitution's application for a Section 401 water quality certification within a reasonable period of time. If the FERC grants Constitution's petition, Constitution will promptly seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We continue to believe this is a project that New York needs to achieve its energy goal, which will require a mix of resources, including natural gas, in order to keep breaks low and supply reliable for Power Generation for the state. 
In line with state energy goals, Constitution will lower emissions by enabling customers switch from heating oil to cleaner burning natural gas. In line with our conservative forecast, we currently exclude the benefits of our capacity on Constitution from our 5-year plan. However, I certainly would not count this project out. 
In this morning's release, we initiated our official 2018 daily production growth guidance, with a range of 15% to 20%, which implies a 17% to 22% pro forma for West Virginia divesture. This production growth is based on capital budget range of $1.025 billion to 1.150 billion, consisting of $750 million to $850 million in the Marcellus, $125 million to $150 million in the Eagle Ford, $75 million in our exploration play and $75 million  for pipeline investments in Atlantic Sunrise and other corporate capital expenditures. We plan to operate 3 rigs and realized  2 completion crews in the Marcellus Shale during 2018. Our pace of completion activity will ultimately dictate where we land within the Marcellus capital range and will be dependent upon market conditions during the year. While we could certainly grow faster than our current guidance, our focus is on maximizing margins, returns and free cash flow, and we firmly believe the flexibility in this current plan allows us to make the most prudent capital allocation decisions throughout the year in response to market dynamics. Capital range for the Marcellus in 2018 will position Cabot from Marcellus production growth of 27% to 33% in 2019. Based on current market indications for natural gas prices, we expect our natural gas price realizations to average $0.45 to $0.50 below NYMEX for the full year of 2018, a significant improvement over 2017 levels. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to operate 1 rig for the full year and utilize 1 completion crew for a portion of the year. The plan allows for us to maintain all or acreage, provide for single-digit growth in oil production and generate positive free cash flow at the current strip. Our capital range for the Eagle Ford will depend on our outlook for all price, with a focus on generating cash flow from this assets as opposed to growth for the sake of growth. We plan to spend $75 million during the first half of '18, continuing to test our 2 new exploratory areas to better understand if they have the attribute we are looking for in order to compete for our capital internally. We would like to be in a position by mid-'18 or sooner to make a decision on whether we move forward with continued activity on these areas based on our results from the first half of the year. As we have stated before, if we do ultimately have a success in these years, we will look to divest assets, to find any near-term deficit spends in these areas that would need to recur before the assets become self funding and free cash flow positive, similar to what we did in the Marcellus years ago. And for example, on the cash flow raise, while fairly small in nature, we are currently marketing our remaining Haynesville properties as we continue to high-grade our portfolio. Based on current strip prices, our 2018 program would deliver the following highlights: Double-digit corporate rate of returns, positive free cash flow of over $200 million at midpoint of the capital budget range, a deleveraging of the balance sheet to below 1x debt to EBITDA, production growth of 15% to 20% and positions the company for significant growth in free cash flow and production in 2019 and '20 as we highlighted in the 3-year Marcellus outlook we included in this morning's release. 
Further on our 3-year outlook, the Marcellus is expected to deliver a 3-year Marcellus production CAGR of 20%-plus and a 3-year Marcellus discretionary cash flow CAGR of 25%-plus percent, assuming current strip prices. Based on this plan, Cabot's Marcellus asset will generate approximately $2.5 billion of cumulative pretax, free cash flow from 2018 to 2020, while averaging between $750 million to $850 million of annual Marcellus capital expenditures over this period. This program only assumes we have the benefit of the infrastructure that is currently under construction, including Atlantic Sunrise and the other 2 power plant projects that we have mentioned. Obviously, any incremental capacity on long-term sales could provide additional upside. Given this level of free cash flow generation, we expect our debt adjusted per share growth metric to look even better than our absolute growth numbers. I would also highlight that based on our internal estimates, as well as consensus estimates for 2019, this plan will generate a best-in-class free cash flow yield compared to the rest of the E&P companies in the S&P 500. While it's premature at this point to outline a specific plan for allocation of free cash flow, we fully expect to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders we a dividend growth and share repurchases as well as evaluating the potential reduction of debt as near-term maturities come to. 
Our longer-term capital allocation to assets outside of the Marcellus will ultimately be dependent on our outlook for oil prices and the outcome of our ongoing exploration testing. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on delivering a self-funded program in Eagle Ford and funding any initial deficit spends in our exploration areas with asset sales. 
In summary, we have a 3-year plan that provides double-digit, returns focused per share growth, while generating significant free cash flow at the current strip, and delivers double-digit corporate wide returns that stand out, not only among energy companies, but also across the broad market, which certainly makes Cabot an attractive investment, regardless of anybody's view on the energy space.

In Gen 5, we went wider by quarter again of the stage spacing, but we had an improved or increased the clusters in the Gen 5 from the 4. Additionally, the fluid pumped in the Gen 4 is a little bit less than the fluid pumped in the Gen 5 to move the volumes that we are moving in the Gen 5. We are staying consistent with the amount of profit per foot. But by widening the business between stages, we are reducing the numbers stages that the will have to pump and a drill out time that will have on getting the well ready for completion.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on",1788,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.
Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
For the third quarter, Cabot demonstrated its continued focus on disciplined capital allocation by generating positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter while delivering 12% equivalent production growth. Operating cash flow increased by 79% year-over-year, driven by our production growth, coupled with a 60% increase in cash margins.
On natural gas, price realizations increased 16% year-over-year. It should come as no surprise that the third quarter realizations were weaker sequentially due to lower NYMEX price and wider differentials. The widening of differentials in the third quarter has been seen in Appalachia over the last few years and highlights the need for the long anticipated in-service of new long-haul infrastructure and in-basin demand projects. Our expectation is that our price realizations will only improve moving forward given the in-service of numerous infrastructure projects over the next few quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $125 million of free cash flow and received over $30 million of proceeds from noncore assets sales, which have allowed us to return almost $125 million of capital to shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases and to reduce our net debt position, further improving our strong balance sheet.
As it relates to share repurchase, while we did not buy back shares during the third quarter, I would highlight that we remain optimistic on this front and take advantage of disconnects in the market, like the recent 9% selloff we experienced during our recent trading blackout period, which did begin after the end of the third quarter.
In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our capital guidance and tightened our production guidance range for the year while leaving the midpoint unchanged, where we ended up in the production -- where we end up in the production guidance range will ultimately be dependent on in-basin pricing during the fourth quarter as Cabot has recently been electing -- curtail a small portion of its production when pricing is value destructive.
As we have reiterated many times before, while production is a byproduct of our capital allocation through high-return projects, we are not chasing top line production growth for the sake of it and have absolutely no problem holding back volumes if the prices do not warrant moving additional gas at certain times. However, I'm not overly concerned about the recent price dynamics given that over the last few years, we have seen some of the widest differentials during the month of October, which has subsequently been followed by a significant improvement in basis.
As most of you are aware, Atlantic Sunrise received its final notice to proceed during the quarter, with pipeline and compression station construction beginning in September. This is a milestone we've been waiting for since our first announcement and our involvement in the project back in February 2014, and represents a key inflection point for the Northeast Pennsylvania natural gas market and for Cabot. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service to this project, on which we will be selling approximately 1 Bcf of new -- of gas to new markets.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline recently reaffirmed that its Orion Project is ahead of schedule and is anticipated to be in service as early as December '17. Additionally, the 2 power plant projects that we are sole suppliers to, Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule for their early September -- excuse me, summer 2018 in-service.
As it relates to Constitution Pipeline, the partners of this project recently submitted a petition for a declaratory order with the FERC, demonstrating that the New York DEC exceeded its statutory time frame to grant or deny the Section 401 certification for the project. The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, the certification requirement shall be waived. It is our belief that New York DEC clearly failed to act on Constitution's application for a Section 401 water quality certification within a reasonable period of time.
If the FERC grants Constitution's petition, Constitution will promptly seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We continue to believe this is a project that New York needs to achieve its energy goal, which will require a mix of resources, including natural gas, in order to keep rates low and supply reliable for power generation for the state.
In line with state energy goals, Constitution will lower emissions by enabling customers switch from heating oil to cleaner-burning natural gas. In line with our conservative forecast, we currently exclude the benefit of our capacity on Constitution from our 5-year plan. However, I certainly would not count this project out. 
In this morning's release, we initiated our official 2018 daily production growth guidance, ranging -- with a range at 15% to 20%, which implies a 17% to 22% pro forma for West Virginia divestiture. This production growth is based on capital budget range of $1.025 billion to $1.150 billion, consisting of $750 million to $850 million in the Marcellus, $125 million to $150 million in the Eagle Ford, $75 million in our exploration play and $75 million for pipeline investments in Atlantic Sunrise and other corporate capital expenditures.
We plan to operate 3 rigs and utilize 2 completion crews in the Marcellus Shale during 2018. Our pace of completion activity will ultimately dictate where we land within the Marcellus capital range and will be dependent upon market conditions during the year. While we could certainly grow faster than our current guidance, our focus is on maximizing margins, returns and free cash flow. And we firmly believe the flexibility in this current plan allows us to make the most prudent capital allocation decisions throughout the year in response to market dynamics.
Capital range for the Marcellus in 2018 will position Cabot from Marcellus production growth of 27% to 33% in 2019. Based on current market indications for natural gas prices, we expect our natural gas price realizations to average $0.45 to $0.50 below NYMEX for the full year of 2018, a significant improvement over 2017 levels.
In the Eagle Ford, we plan to operate 1 rig for the full year and utilize 1 completion crew for a portion of the year. Our plan allows for us to maintain all core acreage, provide for single-digit growth in oil production and generates positive free cash flow at the current strip. Our capital range for the Eagle Ford will depend on our outlook for oil price, with a focus on generating cash flow from this assets as opposed to growth for the sake of growth.
We plan to spend $75 million during the first half of '18, continuing to test our 2 new exploratory areas to better understand if they have the attributes we are looking for in order to compete for our capital internally. We would like to be in a position by mid-'18 or sooner to make a decision on whether we move forward with continued activity on these areas based on our results on the first half of the year. As we have stated before, if we do ultimately have success in these years, we will look to divest assets, to find any near-term deficit spends in these areas that would need to occur before the assets become self-funding and free cash flow positive, similar to what we did in the Marcellus years ago. And for example, on the cash flow raise, while fairly small in nature, we are currently marketing our remaining Haynesville properties as we continue to high-grade our portfolio.
Based on current strip prices, our 2018 program would deliver the following highlights: double-digit corporate-wide returns, positive free cash flow of over $200 million at midpoint of the capital budget range, a deleveraging of the balance sheet to below 1x debt-to-EBITDA, production growth of 15% to 20% and positions the company for significant growth in free cash flow and production in 2019 and '20 as we highlighted in the 3-year Marcellus outlook we included in this morning's release.
Further on our 3-year outlook, the Marcellus is expected to deliver a 3-year Marcellus production CAGR of 20-plus percent and a 3-year Marcellus discretionary cash flow CAGR of 25-plus percent, assuming current strip prices. Based on this plan, Cabot's Marcellus asset will generate approximately $2.5 billion of cumulative pretax, free cash flow from 2018 to 2020 while averaging between $750 million to $850 million of annual Marcellus capital expenditures over this period. This program only assumes we have the benefit of the infrastructure that is currently under construction, including Atlantic Sunrise and the other 2 power plant projects that we have mentioned. Obviously, any incremental capacity on long-term sales could provide additional upside.
Given this level of free cash flow generation, we expect our debt-adjusted per-share growth metric to look even better than our absolute growth numbers. I would also highlight that based on our internal estimates as well as consensus estimates for 2019, this plan will generate a best-in-class free cash flow yield compared to the rest of the E&P companies in the S&P 500. While it's premature at this point to outline a specific plan for allocation of free cash flow, we fully expect to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders via dividend growth and share repurchases as well as evaluate the potential reduction of debt as near-term maturities come due.
Our longer-term capital allocation to assets outside of the Marcellus will ultimately be dependent on our outlook for oil prices and the outcome of our ongoing exploration testing. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on delivering a self-funded program in Eagle Ford and funding any initial deficit spends in our exploration areas with asset sales.
In summary, we have a 3-year plan that provides double-digit, returns-focused per share growth while generating significant free cash flow at the current strip and delivers double-digit corporate-wide returns that stand out not only among energy companies, but also across the broad market, which certainly makes Cabot an attractive investment, regardless of anybody's view on the energy space. Drew, with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

We do have an authorization still on the shelf to buy back shares. When you compare those 2, we will, I think, look at both of them as an avenue to get back money to shareholders. On the dividend, we are moving towards much more certainty attached to our free cash flow generation now that we have the approval of the infrastructure in the ground. With that infrastructure underground and gas moving through additional outlets and also seeing the basis compressed in the -- in all 3 pipes that we currently sell into, we're going to have a significant level of confidence than ongoing continuous improvement in the realizations. And with that, that gives us a little bit more confidence on just the dividend side of our give back. In the meantime, however, though, we have had, as you're aware, $0.5 billion or so of cash on our balance sheet. And we have continued to rationalize our portfolio, and we look at the buybacks with some of that cash. So to say it's a little bit more succinctly, once we get the infrastructure in place, we know we're going to be generating a significant level of free cash. And with that, we'll then make decisions to -- between these share buybacks and the dividends and look at that as prudently as we can."

Charles, there's a lot of similarities between speaking this summer and last summer in terms of mild summers and low demand, storage being a pretty much the same levels and a lot of gas on the market. I think one unique characteristic this year is probably more pipeline maintenance than we've seen in years past or at least, it seems to me, they've been lasting longer and going later into the year. So that's probably the only unique thing. If you look back this time last year or quarter-over-quarter, really, there's only been about $0.06 difference in basis differential between the 2 quarters. So that's pretty consistent. But then on the cash side, where we've seen some very low prices on October as we get to the end of the injection season, we've actually had a pretty good year on cash market year-over-year.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on",1790,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.
Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
For the third quarter, Cabot demonstrated its continued focus on disciplined capital allocation by generating positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter while delivering 12% equivalent production growth. Operating cash flow increased by 79% year-over-year, driven by our production growth, coupled with a 60% increase in cash margins.
On natural gas, price realizations increased 16% year-over-year. It should come as no surprise that the third quarter realizations were weaker sequentially due to lower NYMEX price and wider differentials. The widening of differentials in the third quarter has been seen in Appalachia over the last few years and highlights the need for the long anticipated in-service of new long-haul infrastructure and in-basin demand projects. Our expectation is that our price realizations will only improve moving forward given the in-service of numerous infrastructure projects over the next few quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $125 million of free cash flow and received over $30 million of proceeds from noncore assets sales, which have allowed us to return almost $125 million of capital to shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases and to reduce our net debt position, further improving our strong balance sheet.
As it relates to share repurchases, while we did not buy back shares during the third quarter, I would highlight that we remain optimistic on this front and take advantage of disconnects in the market, like the recent 9% selloff we experienced during our recent trading blackout period, which did begin after the end of the third quarter.
In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our capital guidance and tightened our production guidance range for the year while leaving the midpoint unchanged, where we ended up in the production -- where we end up in the production guidance range will ultimately be dependent on in-basin pricing during the fourth quarter as Cabot has recently been electing to curtail a small portion of its production when pricing is value destructive.
As we have reiterated many times before, while production is a byproduct of our capital allocation through high-return projects, we are not chasing top line production growth for the sake of it and have absolutely no problem holding back volumes if the prices do not warrant moving additional gas at certain times. However, I'm not overly concerned about the recent price dynamics given that over the last few years, we have seen some of the widest differentials during the month of October, which has subsequently been followed by a significant improvement in basis.
As most of you are aware, Atlantic Sunrise received its final notice to proceed during the quarter, with pipeline and compression station construction beginning in September. This is a milestone we've been waiting for since our first announcement and our involvement in the project back in February 2014, and represents a key inflection point for the Northeast Pennsylvania natural gas market and for Cabot. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service to this project, on which we will be selling approximately 1 Bcf of new -- of gas to new markets.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline recently reaffirmed that its Orion Project is ahead of schedule and is anticipated to be in service as early as December '17. Additionally, the 2 power plant projects that we are sole suppliers to, Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule for their early September -- excuse me, summer 2018 in-service.
As it relates to Constitution Pipeline, the partners of this project recently submitted a petition for a declaratory order with the FERC, demonstrating that the New York DEC exceeded its statutory time frame to grant or deny the Section 401 certification for the project. The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, the certification requirement shall be waived. It is our belief that New York DEC clearly failed to act on Constitution's application for a Section 401 water quality certification within a reasonable period of time.
If the FERC grants Constitution's petition, Constitution will promptly seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We continue to believe this is a project that New York needs to achieve its energy goal, which will require a mix of resources, including natural gas, in order to keep rates low and supply reliable for power generation for the state.
In line with state energy goals, Constitution will lower emissions by enabling customers to switch from heating oil to cleaner-burning natural gas. In line with our conservative forecast, we currently exclude the benefit of our capacity on Constitution from our 5-year plan. However, I certainly would not count this project out. 
In this morning's release, we initiated our official 2018 daily production growth guidance, ranging -- with a range at 15% to 20%, which implies a 17% to 22% pro forma for West Virginia divestiture. This production growth is based on capital budget range of $1.025 billion to $1.150 billion, consisting of $750 million to $850 million in the Marcellus, $125 million to $150 million in the Eagle Ford, $75 million in our exploration play and $75 million for pipeline investments in Atlantic Sunrise and other corporate capital expenditures.
We plan to operate 3 rigs and utilize 2 completion crews in the Marcellus Shale during 2018. Our pace of completion activity will ultimately dictate where we land within the Marcellus capital range and will be dependent upon market conditions during the year. While we could certainly grow faster than our current guidance, our focus is on maximizing margins, returns and free cash flow. And we firmly believe the flexibility in this current plan allows us to make the most prudent capital allocation decisions throughout the year in response to market dynamics.
Capital range for the Marcellus in 2018 will position Cabot for Marcellus production growth of 27% to 33% in 2019. Based on current market indications for natural gas prices, we expect our natural gas price realizations to average $0.45 to $0.50 below NYMEX for the full year of 2018, a significant improvement over 2017 levels.
In the Eagle Ford, we plan to operate 1 rig for the full year and utilize 1 completion crew for a portion of the year. Our plan allows for us to maintain all core acreage, provide for single-digit growth in oil production and generates positive free cash flow at the current strip. Our capital range for the Eagle Ford will depend on our outlook for oil price, with a focus on generating free cash flow from this asset as opposed to growth for the sake of growth.
We plan to spend $75 million during the first half of '18, continuing to test our 2 new exploratory areas to better understand if they have the attributes we are looking for in order to compete for our capital internally. We would like to be in a position by mid-'18 or sooner to make a decision on whether we move forward with continued activity on these areas based on our results on the first half of the year. As we have stated before, if we do ultimately have success in these areas, we will look to divest assets, to fund any near-term deficit spends in these areas that would need to occur before the assets become self-funding and free cash flow positive, similar to what we did in the Marcellus years ago. And for example, on the cash flow raise, while fairly small in nature, we are currently marketing our remaining Haynesville properties as we continue to high-grade our portfolio.
Based on current strip prices, our 2018 program would deliver the following highlights: double-digit corporate-wide returns, positive free cash flow of over $200 million at midpoint of the capital budget range, a deleveraging of the balance sheet to below 1x debt-to-EBITDA, production growth of 15% to 20% and positions the company for significant growth in free cash flow and production in 2019 and '20 as we highlighted in the 3-year Marcellus outlook we included in this morning's release.
Further on our 3-year outlook, the Marcellus is expected to deliver a 3-year Marcellus production CAGR of 20-plus percent and a 3-year Marcellus discretionary cash flow CAGR of 25-plus percent, assuming current strip prices. Based on this plan, Cabot's Marcellus asset will generate approximately $2.5 billion of cumulative pretax, free cash flow from 2018 to 2020 while averaging between $750 million to $850 million of annual Marcellus capital expenditures over this period. This program only assumes we have the benefit of the infrastructure that is currently under construction, including Atlantic Sunrise and the other 2 power plant projects that we have mentioned. Obviously, any incremental capacity on long-term sales could provide additional upside.
Given this level of free cash flow generation, we expect our debt-adjusted per-share growth metric to look even better than our absolute growth numbers. I would also highlight that based on our internal estimates as well as consensus estimates for 2019, this plan will generate a best-in-class free cash flow yield compared to the rest of the E&P companies in the S&P 500. While it's premature at this point to outline a specific plan for allocation of free cash flow, we fully expect to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders via dividend growth and share repurchases as well as evaluate the potential reduction of debt as near-term maturities come due.
Our longer-term capital allocation to assets outside of the Marcellus will ultimately be dependent on our outlook for oil prices and the outcome of our ongoing exploration testing. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on delivering a self-funded program in Eagle Ford and funding any initial deficit spends in our exploration areas with asset sales.
In summary, we have a 3-year plan that provides double-digit, returns-focused per share growth while generating significant free cash flow at the current strip and delivers double-digit corporate-wide returns that stand out not only among energy companies, but also across the broad market, which certainly makes Cabot an attractive investment, regardless of anybody's view on the energy space. Drew, with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

We do have an authorization still on the shelf to buy back shares. When you compare those 2, we will, I think, look at both of them as an avenue to get back money to shareholders. On the dividend, we are moving towards much more certainty attached to our free cash flow generation now that we have the approval of the infrastructure going in the ground. With that infrastructure underground and gas moving through additional outlets and also seeing the basis compressed in the -- and on the 3 pipes that we currently sell into, we're going to have a significant level of confidence than ongoing continuous improvement in the realizations. And with that, that gives us a little bit more confidence on just the dividend side of our give back. In the meantime, however, though, we have had, as you're aware, $0.5 billion or so of cash on our balance sheet. And we have continued to rationalize our portfolio, and we look at the buybacks with some of that cash.

It looks like approximately that you'll be filling the capacity so far that you've identified by about the fourth quarter of '19. One, am I thinking about that correctly? And then, two, I guess, as we think about filling visible capacity right now, you talked about being opportunistic. Do you view the communication today around free cash at sort of $1 billion cumulative through the next 3 years as kind of the floor that you'd like to deliver to the market? And how do you square that with -- once you start filling capacity and you witness potential improvement in local basis, how do you sort of blend the desire to deliver that free cash while also weighing -- potentially accelerating beyond the plan you laid out now?"

We do expect the uplift that you've referenced in the differential on the existing pipes. However, if in fact the area rationalization by other operators out there would move into the space and try to backfill where Cabot has moved gas off of those 3 pipes and onto -- into new markets, if there's backfilling and rationalization by the -- or the lack of rationalization by other operators out there, then Cabot is not going to give up a great deal of its market share.

Charles, there's a lot of similarities between this summer and last summer in terms of mild summers and low demand, storage being at pretty much the same levels and a lot of gas on the market. I think one unique characteristic this year is probably more pipeline maintenance than we've seen in years past or at least, it seems to me, they've been lasting longer and going later into the year. So that's probably the only unique thing. If you look back this time last year or quarter-over-quarter, really, there's only been about $0.06 difference in basis differential between the 2 quarters. So that's pretty consistent. But then on the cash side, where we've seen some very low prices in October as we get to the end of the injection season, we've actually had a pretty good year on cash market year-over-year. Year-to-date, I think cash is averaging about $2. This time last year, same term, I think cash is around $1.45 for the year. So we've seen some improvements and a lot that came from last winter, of course. But there's really not a lot of factors, fundamental wise, that have changed."

In Gen 5, we went wider back -- wider again on the stage spacing, but we had an improved -- or increased the clusters in the Gen 5 from the 4. Additionally, the fluid pumped in the Gen 4 is a little bit less than the fluid pumped in the Gen 5 to move the volumes that we are moving in the Gen 5. We are staying consistent with the amount of profit per foot. But by widening the distance between stages, we are reducing the number of stages that we will have to pump and the drill out time that we'll have on getting the well ready for completion. So that's some of the tweaks without the details, that's some of the tweaks that we have between Gen 4 and Gen 5."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on",1790,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team. They're usually here.
Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
For the third quarter, Cabot demonstrated its continued focus on disciplined capital allocation by generating positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter while delivering 12% equivalent production growth. Operating cash flow increased by 79% year-over-year, driven by our production growth, coupled with a 60% increase in cash margins.
On natural gas, price realizations increased 16% year-over-year. It should come as no surprise that the third quarter realizations were weaker sequentially due to lower NYMEX price and wider differentials. The widening of differentials in the third quarter has been seen in Appalachia over the last few years and highlights the need for the long anticipated in-service of new long-haul infrastructure and in-basin demand projects. Our expectation is that our price realizations will only improve moving forward given the in-service of numerous infrastructure projects over the next few quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $125 million of free cash flow and received over $30 million of proceeds from noncore assets sales, which have allowed us to return almost $125 million of capital to shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases and to reduce our net debt position, further improving our strong balance sheet.
As it relates to share repurchases, while we did not buy back shares during the third quarter, I would highlight that we remain optimistic on this front and take advantage of disconnects in the market, like the recent 9% selloff we experienced during our recent trading blackout period, which did begin after the end of the third quarter.
In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our capital guidance and tightened our production guidance range for the year while leaving the midpoint unchanged, where we ended up in the production -- where we end up in the production guidance range will ultimately be dependent on in-basin pricing during the fourth quarter as Cabot has recently been electing to curtail a small portion of its production when pricing is value destructive.
As we have reiterated many times before, while production is a byproduct of our capital allocation through high-return projects, we are not chasing top line production growth for the sake of it and have absolutely no problem holding back volumes if the prices do not warrant moving additional gas at certain times. However, I'm not overly concerned about the recent price dynamics given that over the last few years, we have seen some of the widest differentials during the month of October, which has subsequently been followed by a significant improvement in basis.
As most of you are aware, Atlantic Sunrise received its final notice to proceed during the quarter, with pipeline and compression station construction beginning in September. This is a milestone we've been waiting for since our first announcement and our involvement in the project back in February 2014, and represents a key inflection point for the Northeast Pennsylvania natural gas market and for Cabot. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service to this project, on which we will be selling approximately 1 Bcf of new -- of gas to new markets.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline recently reaffirmed that its Orion Project is ahead of schedule and is anticipated to be in service as early as December '17. Additionally, the 2 power plant projects that we are sole suppliers to, Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule for their early September -- excuse me, summer 2018 in-service.
As it relates to Constitution Pipeline, the partners of this project recently submitted a petition for a declaratory order with the FERC, demonstrating that the New York DEC exceeded its statutory time frame to grant or deny the Section 401 certification for the project. The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, the certification requirement shall be waived. It is our belief that New York DEC clearly failed to act on Constitution's application for a Section 401 water quality certification within a reasonable period of time.
If the FERC grants Constitution's petition, Constitution will promptly seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We continue to believe this is a project that New York needs to achieve its energy goal, which will require a mix of resources, including natural gas, in order to keep rates low and supply reliable for power generation for the state.
In line with state energy goals, Constitution will lower emissions by enabling customers to switch from heating oil to cleaner-burning natural gas. In line with our conservative forecast, we currently exclude the benefit of our capacity on Constitution from our 5-year plan. However, I certainly would not count this project out. 
In this morning's release, we initiated our official 2018 daily production growth guidance, ranging -- with a range at 15% to 20%, which implies a 17% to 22% pro forma for West Virginia divestiture. This production growth is based on capital budget range of $1.025 billion to $1.150 billion, consisting of $750 million to $850 million in the Marcellus, $125 million to $150 million in the Eagle Ford, $75 million in our exploration play and $75 million for pipeline investments in Atlantic Sunrise and other corporate capital expenditures.
We plan to operate 3 rigs and utilize 2 completion crews in the Marcellus Shale during 2018. Our pace of completion activity will ultimately dictate where we land within the Marcellus capital range and will be dependent upon market conditions during the year. While we could certainly grow faster than our current guidance, our focus is on maximizing margins, returns and free cash flow. And we firmly believe the flexibility in this current plan allows us to make the most prudent capital allocation decisions throughout the year in response to market dynamics.
Capital range for the Marcellus in 2018 will position Cabot for Marcellus production growth of 27% to 33% in 2019. Based on current market indications for natural gas prices, we expect our natural gas price realizations to average $0.45 to $0.50 below NYMEX for the full year of 2018, a significant improvement over 2017 levels.
In the Eagle Ford, we plan to operate 1 rig for the full year and utilize 1 completion crew for a portion of the year. Our plan allows for us to maintain all core acreage, provide for single-digit growth in oil production and generates positive free cash flow at the current strip. Our capital range for the Eagle Ford will depend on our outlook for oil price, with a focus on generating free cash flow from this asset as opposed to growth for the sake of growth.
We plan to spend $75 million during the first half of '18, continuing to test our 2 new exploratory areas to better understand if they have the attributes we are looking for in order to compete for our capital internally. We would like to be in a position by mid-'18 or sooner to make a decision on whether we move forward with continued activity on these areas based on our results on the first half of the year. As we have stated before, if we do ultimately have success in these areas, we will look to divest assets, to fund any near-term deficit spends in these areas that would need to occur before the assets become self-funding and free cash flow positive, similar to what we did in the Marcellus years ago. And for example, on the cash flow raise, while fairly small in nature, we are currently marketing our remaining Haynesville properties as we continue to high-grade our portfolio.
Based on current strip prices, our 2018 program would deliver the following highlights: double-digit corporate-wide returns, positive free cash flow of over $200 million at midpoint of the capital budget range, a deleveraging of the balance sheet to below 1x debt-to-EBITDA, production growth of 15% to 20% and positions the company for significant growth in free cash flow and production in 2019 and '20 as we highlighted in the 3-year Marcellus outlook we included in this morning's release.
Further on our 3-year outlook, the Marcellus is expected to deliver a 3-year Marcellus production CAGR of 20-plus percent and a 3-year Marcellus discretionary cash flow CAGR of 25-plus percent, assuming current strip prices. Based on this plan, Cabot's Marcellus asset will generate approximately $2.5 billion of cumulative pretax, free cash flow from 2018 to 2020 while averaging between $750 million to $850 million of annual Marcellus capital expenditures over this period. This program only assumes we have the benefit of the infrastructure that is currently under construction, including Atlantic Sunrise and the other 2 power plant projects that we have mentioned. Obviously, any incremental capacity on long-term sales could provide additional upside.
Given this level of free cash flow generation, we expect our debt-adjusted per-share growth metric to look even better than our absolute growth numbers. I would also highlight that based on our internal estimates as well as consensus estimates for 2019, this plan will generate a best-in-class free cash flow yield compared to the rest of the E&P companies in the S&P 500. While it's premature at this point to outline a specific plan for allocation of free cash flow, we fully expect to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders via dividend growth and share repurchases as well as evaluate the potential reduction of debt as near-term maturities come due.
Our longer-term capital allocation to assets outside of the Marcellus will ultimately be dependent on our outlook for oil prices and the outcome of our ongoing exploration testing. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on delivering a self-funded program in Eagle Ford and funding any initial deficit spends in our exploration areas with asset sales.
In summary, we have a 3-year plan that provides double-digit, returns-focused per share growth while generating significant free cash flow at the current strip and delivers double-digit corporate-wide returns that stand out not only among energy companies, but also across the broad market, which certainly makes Cabot an attractive investment, regardless of anybody's view on the energy space. Drew, with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

On the dividend, we are moving towards much more certainty attached to our free cash flow generation now that we have the approval of the infrastructure going in the ground. With that infrastructure underground and gas moving through additional outlets and also seeing the basis compressed in the -- and on the 3 pipes that we currently sell into, we're going to have a significant level of confidence than ongoing continuous improvement in the realizations. And with that, that gives us a little bit more confidence on just the dividend side of our give back.

So that's probably the only unique thing. If you look back this time last year or quarter-over-quarter, really, there's only been about $0.06 difference in basis differential between the 2 quarters. So that's pretty consistent. But then on the cash side, where we've seen some very low prices in October as we get to the end of the injection season, we've actually had a pretty good year on cash market year-over-year.

So standby on the results of that. When you look at the difference between Gen 4 and Gen 5, one of the changes we've made is the Gen 4's got tight on the stage spacing. In Gen 5, we went wider back -- wider again on the stage spacing, but we had an improved -- or increased the clusters in the Gen 5 from the 4. Additionally, the fluid pumped in the Gen 4 is a little bit less than the fluid pumped in the Gen 5 to move the volumes that we are moving in the Gen 5. We are staying consistent with the amount of profit per foot. But by widening the distance between stages, we are reducing the number of stages that we will have to pump and the drill out time that we'll have on getting the well ready for completion.
