We will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are first and foremost a clinical enterprise. 
Within the DaVita Medical Group, we had great news on our Star Ratings, most of you are familiar with that. If you think about it, we have 6 main markets, and there are 9 key Star measures, so a total of 54 cells [ph] in that grid. And 31 of those 54 cells [ph], we have a five-star rating. That's 57%. And 47 of the 54 categories are either a 4 or a 5, 87%. Those are our best results ever, and we doubt that any other multi-market set of medical groups can match them. So very proud of that.
Within Kidney Care, CMS recently released the results of the ESRD quality incentive program, which is called QIP. We significantly outperformed the industry for the fourth year in a row. Our penalty percentage was about 50% less than the rest of the industry, so very large difference. And we, as always, remained big supporters of the transparency in both the quality incentive program and the five-star programs in both DaVita Kidney Care and DaVita Medical Group.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover. 
Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care cost per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion.
Now I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover 4 headwinds and 2 tailwinds in depth. Let's start with the headwinds. 
First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA plans [ph] for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, lots of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule.
As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted. Concluded that [ph] the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that the significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impacts from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million.
On to the second headwind. Like other health care providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates [ph] costs represent our largest expense, so even a small change in these costs are impactful. 
Third, as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful, I will ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles. 
First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is no. Have leverage with payers changed? The answer is no. They have always been formidable negotiators. Well then, if all of this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversations surrounding shareholder [ph] premium acceptance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in the subset of our situations, we felt it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements.
The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provides much help here. It's hard to speculate in the time frames beyond 2017. And as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements of long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms.
The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017 as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and costs.
Now let's shift onto the tailwind. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a 6-deal -- a 6-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017. However, the specific terms, including pricing, are confidential.
Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a onetime expense pickup in 2017 of approximately $100 million, just due to the timing of the accruals. Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for 401(k) match in 2018.
The aggregation of this is unfortunately the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year, we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower.
Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, 2 of which are normal seasonal [ph] factors. So for example, there are 2 fewer treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4 and 1 fewer treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1.
As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments. So now I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."
35644,419199478,1135459,"DaVita Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Javier. DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million.

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of noncash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call.
As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. 
In terms of the full year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year.
Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $150 million.
An actual question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance? To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds.
First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid. Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016. And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream, focused in 3 main areas.
Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse. Number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients, patient's database [ph] outside the walls of our clinics for check in between office visits as well as mobile sharp [ph] technologies that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are. And then number three, expansion of existing population paid [ph] health capabilities into new markets as we shift from fee-for-service to value.
As you can see, same flat and operating income mask some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our",309,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income.
These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017. Now on to cash flow.
In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter.
Next. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year.
Now a few tax items of note. The effective -- the lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized state tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita, like many other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

In Kidney Care, we are in a period of greater policy uncertainty [ph] that is the norm if you look back over the last 10 years or so, not unique, but more than the norm. And so while we expect a continuation of the positive operating performances we have had for several years, given the policy uncertainty, we could, in fact, do better or worse than the outlook that we've discussed today and earlier this year. The big and obvious reason there are [ph] all the uncertainty surrounding what the new administration and the new congress will do with respect to the Affordable Care Act. 
In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable federal court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless, the debate over what will happen with charitable payment [ph] assistance, not just in kidney care but in all spheres of American health care, in addition to the debates about benefit design and benefit implementation will continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us with love clarity [ph] to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare Secondary Provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the Patient Act enabling us to do global capitation and set us up [ph] throughout the country, et cetera. And as we often point to that the kidney care platform in the United States remains very strong.
The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale. And we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential. 
And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform, with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the noncash amortization, it would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in congress. And we hope that translates into a better rate environment the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years.
Then lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless, worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady. And hopefully, we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we deployed that wonderful shareholder asset, and we'll continue to do so.

Well, I don't know if I quite think about it the same way, so let me stumble here around for a second and see if it can be useful. As we accumulate cash, if we're not thinking that we got the right business opportunities to invest in, there's a point at which we get someone uncomfortable and usually a bunch of you do also with the amount. And then we do stare at the price of the stock and we are not in the camp that some people are in where they just say buybacks are -- buyback decision should be made totally independent of what the stock prices. And we're not in the camp nor do we think we are excellent prognosticators of which way the stock moves as you can tell from the amount of decisions we made over time, whether it's stock buybacks or option exercises or whatever. So we're appropriately humble in thinking about that and there's always upside and downside. So clearly, putting all that stuff together and the fact that it didn't feel that all appropriate to use your money to pay down debt, we thought it was right to put the cash to work by buying back stock, put it to work for you rather than having it sit for a longer and longer period of time on our balance sheet. And of course, we didn't want to reduce our standards for making additional business investments. It is also the case that we think that while '17 is going to be a very tough year compared to perhaps any year in memory, that things are going to be better as we move forward out of '17. It's not to say there isn't risks, but that's where we lean. So is any of that helpful to you in trying to resolve what you feel as sort of a contradiction?"

And the good news is that the new Congress is really serious about doing that. We're in D.C. now, and that subject has probably come up in 4 of the meetings that I've been in the last 24 hours. Having said that, that's a tall mountain to climb, and so you've got tremendous resolve with Paul Ryan and others. At the same time, you've got formidable challenges in pulling it off. So we just love the fact that it's a real possibility. And then what will be do with it? Well, I think we'll wait until we're about to get it before we spend too much time on that, but I think we'll put it through the same decision-making filters that we put our current cash flow through. And then I think you're broader question about is there any other legislation? The other piece of legislation, which has a good shot, is our patient demonstration legislation, wherein we would pick up the right to put thousands and thousands and thousands of our patients into a globally capitated environment where we can provide integrated care, which would significantly improve clinical outcomes and over time, save taxpayers' money. So that's a very, very big deal. We were with a number of the bill sponsors here in the last 24 hours who remain very enthused. And so that's percolating and has very attractive potential."

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover. 
Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care cost per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion.
Now I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover 4 headwinds and 2 tailwinds in depth. Let's start with the headwinds. 
First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA Plans for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, lots of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule.
As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted, concluding that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that the significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impacts from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million.
On to the second headwind. Like other health care providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates costs represent our largest expense, so even a small change in these costs are impactful. 
Third, as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful, I will ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles. 
First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is no. Have leverage with payers changed? The answer is no. They have always been formidable negotiators. Well then, if all of this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversations surrounding charitable premium acceptance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in the subset of our situations, we felt it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements.
The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provide much help here. It's hard to speculate in the time frames beyond 2017. And as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements of long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms.
The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017 as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and costs.
Now let's shift onto the tailwind. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a 6-deal -- a 6-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017. However, the specific terms, including pricing, are confidential.
Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a onetime expense pickup in 2017 of approximately $100 million, just due to the timing of the accruals. Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for 401(k) match in 2018.
The aggregation of this is unfortunately the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year, we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower.
Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, 2 of which are normal season factors. So for example, there are 2 fewer treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4 and 1 fewer treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1.
As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments. So now I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million.

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of noncash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call.
As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. 
In terms of the full year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year.
Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $150 million.
An actual question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance? To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds.
First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid. Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016. And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream, focused in 3 main areas.
Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse; number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients, patients face to face outside the walls of our clinics for check in between office visits as well as mobile chat [ph] technology that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are. And then number three, expansion of existing population paid [ph] health capabilities into new markets as we shift from fee-for-service to value.
As you can see, same flat and operating income mask some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our",309,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income.
These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017. Now on to cash flow.
In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter.
Next. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year.
Now a few tax items of note. The effective -- the lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized state tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita, like many other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

In Kidney Care, we are in a period of greater policy uncertainty that is the norm if you look back over the last 10 years or so, not unique, but more than the norm. And so while we expect a continuation of the positive operating performances we have had for several years, given the policy uncertainty, we could, in fact, do better or worse than the outlook that we've discussed today and earlier this year. The big and obvious reason there are all the uncertainty surrounding what the new administration and the new congress will do with respect to the Affordable Care Act. 
In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable federal court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless, the debate over what will happen with charitable premium assistance, not just in Kidney Care but in all spheres of American health care, in addition to the debates about benefit design and benefit implementation will continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us would love clarity to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare Secondary Provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the Patient Act enabling us to do global capitation and centers throughout the country, et cetera. And as we often point to that the Kidney Care platform in the United States remains very strong.
The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale. And we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential. 
And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform, with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the noncash amortization, it would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in congress. And we hope that translates into a better rate environment the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years.
Then lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless, worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady. And hopefully, we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we deployed that wonderful shareholder asset, and we'll continue to do so.

As we accumulate cash, if we're not thinking that we got the right business opportunities to invest in, there's a point at which we get somewhat uncomfortable and usually a bunch of you do also with the amount. And then we do stare at the price of the stock and we are not in the camp that some people are in where they just say buybacks are -- buyback decision should be made totally independent of what the stock prices. We're not in that camp, nor do we think that we're excellent prognosticators of which way the stock moves as you can tell from a lot of decisions we've made over time, whether it's stock buybacks or option exercises or whatever. So we're appropriately humble in thinking about that and there's always upside and downside. So clearly, putting all that stuff together and the fact that it didn't feel at all appropriate to use your money to pay down debt, we thought it was right to put the cash to work by buying back stock, put it to work for you rather than having it sit for a longer and longer period of time on our balance sheet. And of course, we didn't want to reduce our standards for making additional business investments. It is also the case that we think that while '17 is going to be a very tough year compared to perhaps any year in memory, that things are going to be better as we move forward out of '17.

The other piece of legislation, which has a good shot, is our patient demonstration legislation, wherein we would pick up the right to put thousands and thousands and thousands of our patients into a globally capitated environment where we can provide integrated care, which would significantly improve clinical outcomes and over time, save taxpayers' money.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover. 
Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care cost per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion.
Now I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover 4 headwinds and 2 tailwinds in depth. Let's start with the headwinds. 
First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA Plans for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, lots of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule.
As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted, concluding that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that the significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impacts from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million.
On to the second headwind. Like other health care providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates costs represent our largest expense, so even a small change in these costs are impactful. 
Third, as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful, I will ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles. 
First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is no. Have leverage with payers changed? The answer is no. They have always been formidable negotiators. Well then, if all of this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversations surrounding charitable premium acceptance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in the subset of our situations, we felt it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements.
The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provide much help here. It's hard to speculate in the time frames beyond 2017. And as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements of long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms.
The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017 as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and costs.
Now let's shift onto the tailwind. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a 6-deal -- a 6-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017. However, the specific terms, including pricing, are confidential.
Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a onetime expense pickup in 2017 of approximately $100 million, just due to the timing of the accruals. Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for 401(k) match in 2018.
The aggregation of this is unfortunately the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year, we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower.
Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, 2 of which are normal season factors. So for example, there are 2 fewer treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4 and 1 fewer treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1.
As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments. So now I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million.

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of noncash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call.
As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. 
In terms of the full year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year.
Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $150 million.
An actual question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance? To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds.
First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid. Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016. And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream, focused in 3 main areas.
Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse; number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients, patients face to face outside the walls of our clinics for check in between office visits as well as mobile chart technology that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are. And then number three, expansion of existing population paid [ph] health capabilities into new markets as we shift from fee-for-service to value.
As you can see, same flat and operating income mask some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our",309,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income.
These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017. Now on to cash flow.
In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter.
Next. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year.
Now a few tax items of note. The effective -- the lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized state tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita, like many other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America.

In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable federal court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless, the debate over what will happen with charitable premium assistance, not just in Kidney Care but in all spheres of American health care, in addition to the debates about benefit design and benefit implementation will continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us would love clarity to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare Secondary Provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the Patient Act enabling us to do global capitation and centers throughout the country, et cetera. And as we often point to that the Kidney Care platform in the United States remains very strong.
The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale. And we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential. 
And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform, with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the noncash amortization, it would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in congress. And we hope that translates into a better rate environment the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years.
Then lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless, worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady. And hopefully, we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we deployed that wonderful shareholder asset, and we'll continue to do so.

Well, I think we'll wait until we're about to get it before we spend too much time on that, but I think we'll put it through the same decision-making filters that we put our current cash flow through. And then I think your broader question about is there any other legislation? The other piece of legislation, which has a good shot, is our patient demonstration legislation, wherein we would pick up the right to put thousands and thousands and thousands of our patients into a globally capitated environment where we can provide integrated care, which would significantly improve clinical outcomes and over time, save taxpayers' money.

I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover. Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care cost per treatment, resulting in an a",816,"Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. I'm going to jump right in because I have a lot to cover. 
Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care cost per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion.
Now I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover 4 headwinds and 2 tailwinds in depth. Let's start with the headwinds. 
First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA Plans for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, lots of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule.
As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted, concluding that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that the significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impacts from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million.
On to the second headwind. Like other health care providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates costs represent our largest expense, so even a small change in these costs are impactful. 
Third, as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful, I will ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles. 
First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is no. Have leverage with payers changed? The answer is no. They have always been formidable negotiators. Well then, if all of this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversations surrounding charitable premium acceptance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in the subset of our situations, we felt it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements.
The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provide much help here. It's hard to speculate in the time frames beyond 2017. And as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements of long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms.
The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017 as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and costs.
Now let's shift onto the tailwind. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a 6-deal -- a 6-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017. However, the specific terms, including pricing, are confidential.
Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a onetime expense pickup in 2017 of approximately $100 million, just due to the timing of the accruals. Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for 401(k) match in 2018.
The aggregation of this is unfortunately the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year, we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower.
Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, 2 of which are normal season factors. So for example, there are 2 fewer treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4 and 1 fewer treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1.
As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments. So now I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of noncash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call.
As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. 
In terms of the full year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year.
Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $150 million.
An actual question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance? To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds.
First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid. Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016. And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream, focused in 3 main areas.
Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse; number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients, patients face to face outside the walls of our clinics for check in between office visits as well as mobile chart technology that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are. And then number three, expansion of existing population paid [ph] health capabilities into new markets as we shift from fee-for-service to value.
As you can see, same flat and operating income mask some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our",309,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income.
These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017. Now on to cash flow.
In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter.
Next. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year.
Now a few tax items of note. The effective -- the lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized state tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita, like many other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

In Kidney Care, we are in a period of greater policy uncertainty that is the norm if you look back over the last 10 years or so, not unique, but more than the norm. And so while we expect a continuation of the positive operating performances we have had for several years, given the policy uncertainty, we could, in fact, do better or worse than the outlook that we've discussed today and earlier this year. The big and obvious reason there are all the uncertainty surrounding what the new administration and the new congress will do with respect to the Affordable Care Act. 
In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable federal court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless, the debate over what will happen with charitable premium assistance, not just in Kidney Care but in all spheres of American health care, in addition to the debates about benefit design and benefit implementation will continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us would love clarity to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare Secondary Provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the Patient Act enabling us to do global capitation and centers throughout the country, et cetera. And as we often point to that the Kidney Care platform in the United States remains very strong.
The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale. And we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential. 
And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform, with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the noncash amortization, it would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in congress. And we hope that translates into a better rate environment the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years.
Then lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless, worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady. And hopefully, we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we deployed that wonderful shareholder asset, and we'll continue to do so.

Well, I don't know if I quite think about it the same way, so let me stumble around here for a second and see if it can be useful. As we accumulate cash, if we're not thinking that we got the right business opportunities to invest in, there's a point at which we get somewhat uncomfortable and usually a bunch of you do also with the amount. And then we do stare at the price of the stock and we are not in the camp that some people are in where they just say buybacks are -- buyback decision should be made totally independent of what the stock price is. We're not in that camp, nor do we think that we're excellent prognosticators of which way the stock moves as you can tell from a lot of decisions we've made over time, whether it's stock buybacks or option exercises or whatever. So we're appropriately humble in thinking about that and there's always upside and downside. So clearly, putting all that stuff together and the fact that it didn't feel at all appropriate to use your money to pay down debt, we thought it was right to put the cash to work by buying back stock, put it to work for you rather than having it sit for a longer and longer period of time on our balance sheet. And of course, we didn't want to reduce our standards for making additional business investments. It is also the case that we think that while '17 is going to be a very tough year compared to perhaps any year in memory, that things are going to be better as we move forward out of '17. It's not to say there isn't risks, but that's where we lean. So is any of that helpful to you in trying to resolve what you feel as sort of a contradiction?"

Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to this quarterly call. On a summary basis at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment, as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance all the normal risks associated therewith. 
Before we get into any specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. 
First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called Ride The Wave where we attempt to reach out to each and everyone of our senior members. That's 360,000 human beings that we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and fee-for-service ever get and radically different than many other MA plans as well.
Onto Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid. 1/3 of our commercial contracts are now -- now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our approved clinical processes in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, physicians with catheters are 9x more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care are differentially our clarity quality care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives down health care costs. Now I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care."

Q1 was in line with what we expected in Kidney Care. I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers.
Non-acquired gross for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance. Let me elaborate on each. 
First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher [ EPO ] utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and 2 fewer treatment days.
Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the 4 headwinds. 
Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA Plans. Number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages. Number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations. You won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements and other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters. Finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017, as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year.
Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share programs to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March.
Next, we're happy to announce the closing in the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in 6 states. As part of the deal, we had to divest 7 centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some onetime costs to integrate the business.
Finally, we just executed extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of comorbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improved the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the health care system.
As to outlook. We're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on health care in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions.
Now on to Vijay Kotte A to discuss DMG."

These results include a few things. First, $10 million of expected rate headwind. Second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated noncash grand amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG. And third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter.
Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter, driven in part by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by composite results from true-ups to existing sure settings pool.
As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it's more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the midyear revenue true-ups the typically occur during summer.
Looking beyond 2017. In April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results and projected rate to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expense trends over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectation at our Capital Markets Day later this month.
Now to Joel to discuss international and some other financial items."

To everyone on the phone, as you probably know, this is my first earnings call and it is a pleasure to be here. I look forward to meeting many of you at Capital Markets Day in a few weeks.
First, I will address our international operations. The adjusted operating loss from our international business was $11 million. These results includes a $3.5 million currency loss within the Asia Pacific Joint Venture. A $6 million noncash gain on the creation of our Asia JV has been excluded from the adjusted operating income. We continue to expect adjusted international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017, excluding any currency gain or -- gains or losses. We are also excited to welcome [ Robert Lang ] as our President of our International Operations. He started with us in April. Robert joins us with extensive experience growing international healthcare and insurance businesses.
Next, a few financial details for the enterprise. In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was 40% in the quarter, after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million.

You never -- you know how this works, you would never say the odds are on your side because in a world where little is being passed, you just can never say that. But it's a highly respected piece of legislation with broad bipartisan support. I'll remind everyone that we passed the House Ways and Means Committee last -- late last fall with 1 dissenting vote in a year when that virtually never happened in any piece of [indiscernible] legislation in the House. Having said that, it's a real battle in each new year to try to rise above the noise. And so I think I just have to leave it as we have a real shot, and we're working it hard and it would be a tremendous victory for both patients and the taxpayers and that's increasingly known and increasingly attractive, but that doesn't mean it's in the home stretch."

Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to this quarterly call. 
On a summary basis at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance all the normal risks associated therewith. 
Before we get into more specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called [ Ride The Wave ], where we attempt to reach out to each and everyone of our senior members. That's 360,000 human beings that we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and fee for service ever get and radically different than many other MA plans as well.
Onto Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid. 1/3 of our commercial contracts are now -- now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our improved clinical processes and in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, patients with catheters are 9x more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. 
As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care or differentially quality care not only results in healthier patients but also drives down health care costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care."

I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance. Let me elaborate on each. 
First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and 2 fewer treatment days.
Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the 4 headwinds. Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA Plans. Number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages. Number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations. You won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements and other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters. Finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017 as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year.
Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share program to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from a recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we've previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March.
Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in 6 states. As part of the deal, we had to divest 7 centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some onetime costs to integrate the business.
Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of co-morbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improved the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the health care system.
As to outlook. We're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on health care in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions.
Now on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

For the first quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had operating income of $12 million. These results include a few things. First, $10 million of expected rate headwind; second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated noncash grand amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG; and third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter. Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter driven, in part, by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by composite results from true-ups to existing shared savings pool.
As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it's more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the midyear revenue true-ups that typically occur during summer.
Looking beyond 2017. In April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results in projected rate to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expenses trend over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectation at our Capital Markets Day later this month.
Now to Joel to discuss international and some other financial items."

To everyone on the phone, as you probably know, this is my first earnings call, and it is a pleasure to be here. I look forward to meeting many of you at Capital Markets Day in a few weeks.
First, I will address our international operations. The adjusted operating loss from our international business was $11 million. This result includes a $3.5 million currency loss within the Asia Pacific joint venture. A $6 million noncash gain on the creation of our Asia JV has been excluded from the adjusted operating income. We continue to expect adjusted international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017, excluding any currency gain or -- gains or losses. 
We are also excited to welcome Robert Lang as the President of our International Operations. He started with us in April. Robert joins us with extensive experience growing international health care and insurance businesses.
Next, a few financial details for the enterprise. In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was 40% in the quarter after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million.

And so as opposed to the journey, the destination ended up being the right one. How many patients are on and off exchange? We're kind of combining them, and there's approximately 2,500, which is, of course, give or take, half of the 3,000 plus 2,000 that we alluded to last year. Does that answer your question?"

Second, as to the particulars of our Patient Act that we have a real shot. You never -- you know how this works, you would never say the odds are on your side because in a world where little is being passed, you just can never say that. But it's a highly respected piece of legislation with broad bipartisan support. I'll remind everyone that we've passed the House Ways and Means Committee last -- late last fall with one dissenting vote in a year when that virtually never happened in any piece of subset of legislation in the House. Having said that, it's a real battle each new year to try to rise above the noise. And so I think I just have to leave it as we have a real shot, and we're working it hard. And it would be a tremendous victory for both patients and the taxpayers. And that's increasingly known and increasingly attractive, but that doesn't mean it's in the home stretch."

Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to this quarterly call. 
On a summary basis at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance, all the normal risks associated therewith. 
Before we get into more specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called Ride The Wave, where we attempt to reach out to each and every one of our senior members. That's 360,000 human beings, and we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and fee for service ever get and radically different than many other MA plans as well.
Onto Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid. 1/3 of our commercial contracts are now -- now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our improved clinical processes and in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, patients with catheters are 9x more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. 
As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care -- our differentially high quality care not only results in healthier patients but also drives down health care costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care."

I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance. Let me elaborate on each. 
First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and 2 fewer treatment days.
Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the 4 headwinds: Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA Plans; number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages; number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations, you won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements and other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters; finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017 as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year.
Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share program to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we've previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March.
Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in 6 states. As part of the deal, we had to divest 7 centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some onetime costs to integrate the business.
Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of co-morbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improved the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the health care system.
As to outlook. We're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on health care in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor the political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions.
Now on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

For the first quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had operating income of $12 million. These results include a few things. First, $10 million of expected rate headwind; second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated noncash grant amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG; and third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter. Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter driven, in part, by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by some positive results from true-ups to existing shared savings pool.
As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it's more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the midyear revenue true-ups that typically occur during summer.
Looking beyond 2017. In April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results in projected rate to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expenses trend over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectation at our Capital Markets Day later this month.
Now to Joel to discuss international and some other financial items."

To everyone on the phone, as you probably know, this is my first earnings call, and it is a pleasure to be here. I look forward to meeting many of you at Capital Markets Day in a few weeks.
First, I will address our international operations. The adjusted operating loss from our international business was $11 million. This result includes a $3.5 million currency loss within the Asia Pacific joint venture. A $6 million noncash gain on the creation of our Asia JV has been excluded from the adjusted operating income. We continue to expect adjusted international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017, excluding any currency gain or -- gains or losses. 
We are also excited to welcome Robert Lang as the President of our International Operations. He started with us in April. Robert joins us with extensive experience growing international health care and insurance businesses.
Next, a few financial details for the enterprise. In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was 40% in the quarter after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million.

Second, as to the particulars of our Patient Act, we have a real shot. You never -- you know how this works, you would never say the odds are on your side because in a world where little is being passed, you just can never say that. But it's a highly respected piece of legislation with broad bipartisan support. I'll remind everyone that we passed the House Ways and Means Committee last -- late last fall with one dissenting vote in a year when that virtually never happened on any piece of substantive legislation in the House. Having said that, it's a real battle each new year to try to rise above the noise. And so I think I just have to leave it as we have a real shot, and we're working it hard. And it would be a tremendous victory for both patients and the taxpayers. And that's increasingly known and increasingly attractive, but that doesn't mean it's in the home stretch."

Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to this quarterly call. 
On a summary basis at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance, all the normal risks associated therewith. 
Before we get into more specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called Ride The Wave, where we attempt to reach out to each and every one of our senior members. That's 360,000 human beings, and we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and fee for service ever get and radically different than many other MA plans as well.
Onto Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid. 1/3 of our commercial contracts are now -- now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our improved clinical processes and in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, patients with catheters are 9x more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. 
As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care -- our differentially high quality care not only results in healthier patients but also drives down health care costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care."

Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our",556,"Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Q1 was in line with what we expected in Kidney Care. I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance. Let me elaborate on each. 
First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and 2 fewer treatment days.
Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the 4 headwinds: Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA Plans; number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages; number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations, you won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements and other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters; finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017 as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year.
Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share program to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we've previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March.
Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in 6 states. As part of the deal, we had to divest 7 centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some onetime costs to integrate the business.
Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of co-morbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improved the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the health care system.
As to outlook. We're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on health care in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor the political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions.
Now on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG."

For the first quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had operating income of $12 million. These results include a few things. First, $10 million of expected rate headwind; second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated noncash grant amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG; and third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter. Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter driven, in part, by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by some positive results from true-ups to existing shared savings pool.
As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it's more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the midyear revenue true-ups that typically occur during summer.
Looking beyond 2017. In April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results in projected rate to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expenses trend over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectation at our Capital Markets Day later this month.

Next, a few financial details for the enterprise. In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was 40% in the quarter after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric health care service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

We are first and foremost a caregiving entity. 
Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 4.9 star average ratings across all markets. This, if you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5-star, which is the highest we've had achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our peer partners.
Within DaVita Kidney Care, bloat overlord is 1 of the 3 leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researches estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended posttreatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year, further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels. And in the second quarter '17, we had our best-ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended posttreatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal.

Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations.
Let me cover some highlights. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis. 
Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive onetime adjustments. We continue to expect full year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full year average in 2016. 
Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter, driven by better performance and center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter 1 cost per treatment, including IPO utilization, payroll taxes and less treatment days.
Now turning onto our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. 
Looking ahead to 2018, similar to the last couple of years, we'll issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.
That said, I wonder -- want to remind you of a couple of such as the guidance to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change for profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we received from payers. It maybe hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefits from our new EPO contract as well as a onetime benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%.
Now I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG."

For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 mill",500,"Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter.
Now with respect to our value conversion, we're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington state by the end of the year. We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are capital-efficient and low-risk way of a quarrying new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers, serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated.
Regarding guidance for DMG. We're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to [ $150 ] million, and we still believe it's more likely that we'll be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017.
Now to international. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign-exchange loss. For the full year in the international business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low [ $30 millions ], plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and onetime expenses. 
We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for kidney care and the enterprise.
Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018.
Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. As we discussed in our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of the strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters.
In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

We will, today, of course, discuss what we would characterize as a solid quarter. Before we get into the specifics of that quarter, however, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving entity.
Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 49-star average ratings across all markets. This, if you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5 star, which is the highest we've ever achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our payer partners.
Within DaVita Kidney Care, fluid overload is 1 of the 3 leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researches estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended post-treatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year, further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels, and in the second quarter of '17, we had our best-ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended post-treatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal.
And I'll now turn it over to Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care, to discuss that quarter."

Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Let me cover some highlights.
Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis.
Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive onetime adjustments. We continue to expect full year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full year average in 2016.
Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter, driven by better performance in center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter 1 cost per treatment, including EPO utilization, payroll taxes and less treatment days.
Now turning onto our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion.
Looking ahead to 2018. Similar to the last couple of years, we will issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. That said, I want to remind you of a couple of specific items to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we receive from payers. It may be hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefits from our new EPO contract as well as the onetime benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%.
Now I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG."

For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 mill",498,"Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter.
Now with respect to our value conversion, we're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington state by the end of the year. We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are a capital-efficient and low-risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers, serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated.
Regarding guidance for DMG. We're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to $150 million, and we still believe it's more likely that we will be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017.
Now to international. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign exchange loss. For the full year in the international business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions, plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and onetime expenses. We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care and the enterprise.
Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018.
Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of the strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

It is not good for the citizens because there are some centers that are profitable, and they carry all the centers that are not profitable. And so if that passes, it would have a disruption to the care, and over the long haul, it would be a real problem for the ERs and for the patients there. So we hope that policymakers will see through this as what it is, which is bad policy, and we, of course, are working hard with all our constituents in the community to educate them."

We will, today, of course, discuss what we would characterize as a solid quarter. Before we get into the specifics of that quarter, however, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving entity.
Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 4.9-star average ratings across all markets. This, if you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5-star, which is the highest we've ever achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our payer partners.
Within DaVita Kidney Care, fluid overload is 1 of the 3 leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researches estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended post-treatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year, further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels, and in the second quarter of '17, we had our best-ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended post-treatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal.
And I'll now turn it over to Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care, to discuss that quarter."

Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Let me cover some highlights.
Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis.
Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive onetime adjustments. We continue to expect full year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full year average in 2016.
Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter, driven by better performance in center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter 1 cost per treatment, including EPO utilization, payroll taxes and less treatment days.
Now turning onto our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion.
Looking ahead to 2018. Similar to the last couple of years, we will issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. That said, I want to remind you of a couple of specific items to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we receive from payers. It may be hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefits from our new EPO contract as well as the onetime benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%.
Now I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG."

For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 mill",498,"Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter.
Now with respect to our value conversion, we're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington state by the end of the year. We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are a capital-efficient and low-risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers, serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated.
Regarding guidance for DMG. We're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to $150 million, and we still believe it's more likely that we will be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017.
Now to international. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign exchange loss. For the full year in the international business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions, plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and onetime expenses. We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care and the enterprise.
Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018.
Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of the strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

We will, today, of course, discuss what we would characterize as a solid quarter. Before we get into the specifics of that quarter, however, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving entity.
Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 4.9-star average ratings across all markets. This, if you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5-star, which is the highest we've ever achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our payer partners.
Within DaVita Kidney Care, fluid overload is 1 of the 3 leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researches estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended post-treatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year, further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels, and in the second quarter of '17, we had our best-ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended post-treatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal.
And I'll now turn it over to Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care, to discuss that quarter."

Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Let me cover some highlights.
Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis.
Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive onetime adjustments. We continue to expect full year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full year average in 2016.
Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter, driven by better performance in center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter 1 cost per treatment, including EPO utilization, payroll taxes and less treatment days.
Now turning onto our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion.
Looking ahead to 2018. Similar to the last couple of years, we will issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. That said, I want to remind you of a couple of specific items to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we receive from payers. It may be hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefits from our new EPO contract as well as the onetime benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%.
Now I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG."

For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 mill",498,"Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter.
Now with respect to our value conversion, we're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington state by the end of the year. We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are a capital-efficient and low-risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers, serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated.
Regarding guidance for DMG. We're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to $150 million, and we still believe it's more likely that we will be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017.
Now to international. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign exchange loss. For the full year in the international business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions, plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and onetime expenses. We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care and the enterprise.
Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018.
Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of the strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

Should we think about that as -- given the fact that you took those impairments, it's less likely you can offset that $30 million, and we should think about that as potentially a greater risk than you even mentioned at the Investor Day? Or is this just kind of mechanical?"

Our [indiscernible] Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program where we implemented pain scarring tools, risk assessment, urine screen and trainings [indiscernible] for providers.

Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishment in the area of integrated care.

And the recent ESCO data both from us and others further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. It is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENT Act where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishment. 
As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable, it's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives [indiscernible] flexible and substantive participation options.

For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million noncash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items. Before I discuss the drivers of this",599,"Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. 
For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million noncash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items. 
Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future.
As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of [ $16 ] million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter.
The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of 2 drivers. First, higher-than-expected medical costs, which represents about [ $30 ] million of impact. This is largely the result of 2 things: increased utilization, driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past; and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement.
Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter, was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a [ $13 ] million item in 2016. 
Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the 4 drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day. However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. 
Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 nonclinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018.
Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. 
We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons. 
First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring, as I just mentioned. Second, [ $30 ] million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase, as I mentioned before. Third, we expect to benefit from 4 risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets. Finally, we've been making progress in recontracting with payers in our legacy market and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements on terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business. 
Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018.
We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed. 
For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the 4 levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017. 
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care."

Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter. As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the",849,"Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. 
Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter. 
As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism at a time of real crisis.
From working multiple shifts back-to-back to rescuing stranded patients in their boat so they can be [indiscernible] to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families. It was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates. 
Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. 
Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from mistreatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process.
The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. 
We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017. 
Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis in lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. 
Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact.
Now I'm going to transition to proactively address 3 topics: [indiscernible] assistance, care contracting and guidance. Let me start with [indiscernible] assistance. 
As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to [indiscernible] premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize 4 most important points. Point #1, [indiscernible] premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patient who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment; point number two, we think [indiscernible] premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons; point number three, even with [indiscernible] premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage despite facing significant financial hardship; point number four, with this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately 100 million to 250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provide a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comment for Q&A.
For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide some additional color and try to be as helpful as I can. 
As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little bit more detail, what does this mean? 4 out of our 5 largest payers have [indiscernible] to the next 2 to 3 years, and we're currently negotiating assist in the normal cadence of renewals. 
For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-take negotiations and some will end up and some will end down. 
On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane.
Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. 
First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018.
In our guidance, we're calling up 3 elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap. 
Number one, open enrollment for ACA Plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decision. Point number two, [indiscernible]. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet. And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a valid initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range.
Longer term, we continue to expect the multiyear trajectory to be consistent with what we said at Capital Markets Day earlier this year. 
Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international."

For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes a $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. These restructuring charges related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level. We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international costs starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirmed international OI guidance we provided last quarter.

As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses.
Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of 4 days over the last 2 quarters due to the following: As a reminder, 1 day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the 4 days were the result of 3 things. First, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which result -- which contributed 1 day. We expect our DSOs to decline 3 to 4 days over the next [ few ] quarters as we work through these items.
Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately 3 days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital.
We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

I'd like to offer a few thoughts on 3 topics. Number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks. 
While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt, have already noted. 
It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results. We are intensely focused on affecting a change and the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. 
Steps like the [ $40 ] million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are still in our control, many others involved third parties and therefore are difficult to time. 
I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above or explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act. We have a responsibility, both regulatory and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients. 
And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are 2 subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare secondary payer statute or commercial coverage. Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for. 
Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system.
Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. 
In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining. 
Year-to-date, this means year-to-date through November 7, that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital.

And I guess when we think about the DMG outlook, and I guess I appreciate the complexity of the DMG business and the general rate pressure in that business over the last several years.

I mean, as we think about this business [indiscernible] since you've owned it, does HCP have this problem before you owned it as far as quarterly visibility?

The 2 big changes in the last 4, 5 years compared to the prior 4, 5 are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff, and then number two, in the case of HCP, a nontrivial increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period. And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be [ massed ] by your reimbursement per member per month increase. Because in the last 4, 5 years, instead of increases in those 2 areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million, I'm not going to get the number exactly right. Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI.

If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity. And so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and unusual incidents of serious issues within that flu population in the first quarter. The derivative benefit from all that extra care and costs is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture. So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one a subsequent year. 
To be honest from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the costs and the revenues deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue."

Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's a very difficult -- impossible would be a better word to predict. 
You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they are making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business while at the same time complaining about the exchanges that, that pressure has also abated somewhat. 
So I want to repeat. It's still on the agenda, both of the plans and of the administration. And we can't predict when they're going to do something.

The 10b5-1 solved the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time and we can't respond based on all the other factors. So we use of both. When we do 10b5-1s, we tend to lean towards more complex plans to try and think forward about what's likely to happen and ensure that we're buying at opportune times. That said, there can be unintended consequences of the complexities of our 10b5-1 plans."

Before we get into the specifics of our Q3 financial performance and outlook, we'll start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. First within the DaVita Medical Group, the opioid epidemic, of course, is getting a great amount of publicity and appropriately so. Our Everett Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program, where we implemented pain scoring tools, risk assessment, urine screens and training [ supportings ] for providers. And we're recognized by the community for the exemplary leadership that we demonstrated. 
Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishment in the area of integrated care. If you look at the CSNPs that we've been involved with for 10 years or so, the outcomes are simply outstanding. Just to name a few, 25% reduction to hospitalizations, 49% fewer readmissions, 60% -- 66% lower PBC rates compared to the national average, et cetera, et cetera. And the recent ESCO data, both from us and others, further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. This is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENTS Act, where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishments.
As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable. It's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives nephrologists flexible and substantive participation options. More on that in the quarters to come.
But now I'll turn it over to Joel Ackerman to discuss DaVita Medical Group."
35644,540685601,1336687,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.Before I discuss the drivers of this d",591,"Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.
Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future.
As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of $16 million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter.
The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of 2 drivers: first, higher-than-expected medical costs, which represents about $30 million of impact. This is largely the result of 2 things: increased utilization driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement.
Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a $13 million item in 2016.
Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the 4 drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day. However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018.
Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons: First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring as I just mentioned; second, $30 million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase as I mentioned before; Third, we expect to benefit from 4 risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets; Finally, we've been making progress in recontracting with payers in our legacy market and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements in terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business. Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018. We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed.
For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the 4 levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care."
35644,540685601,1336687,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the",860,"Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism in a time of real crisis. From working multiple shifts back to back to rescuing stranded patients in their boats, so they can be dialyzed, to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families, it was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates.
Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from mistreatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process.
The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017.
Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact.
Now I'm going to transition to proactively address 3 topics: charitable premium assistance, payer contracting and guiding. Let me start with charitable premium assistance.
As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to charitable premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize 4 most important points: Point #1, charitable premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patient who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment; Point #2, we think charitable premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons; Point #3, even if charitable premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage despite facing significant financial hardship; Point #4, if this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately $100 million to $250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provided a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comments for Q&A.
For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide some additional color and try to be as helpful as I can. As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little more detail? What does this mean? 4 out of our 5 largest payers have raised [ lock ins ] the next 2 to 3 years, and we're currently negotiating [ assist ] in the normal cadence of renewals. For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-take negotiations. So some will end up, and some will end up down.
On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane.
Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018.
In our guidance, it's worth calling out 3 elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap: number one, open enrollment for ACA Plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decisions. Point #2, [ cost of medics ]. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet. And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a valid initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime cost in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range. Longer term, we continue to expect the multi-year trajectory to be consistent with what we said at Capital Markets Day earlier this year.
Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international."
35644,540685601,1336687,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Javier. For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes a $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restru",404,"Thank you, Javier. For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes a $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. These restructuring charges related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level. We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international costs starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirmed international OI guidance we provided last quarter.
Looking forward, we continue to expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses.
Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of 4 days over the last 2 quarters due to the following: As a reminder, 1 day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the 4 days were the result of 3 things: first, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which result -- which contributed 1 day. We expect our DSOs to decline 3 to 4 days over the next few quarters as we work through these items.
Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately 3 days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital. We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

I'd like to offer a few thoughts on 3 topics: number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks.While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at t",531,"Thank you, Joel. I'd like to offer a few thoughts on 3 topics: number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks.
While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt have already noted.  It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results.
We are intensely focused on effecting a change in the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. Steps like the $40 million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are solely in our control. Many others involve third parties and therefore, are difficult to time.
I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates acted ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above forward, explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act. We have a responsibility, both regulatory and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients.
And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are 2 subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare secondary payer statute or commercial coverage. Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way, unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for.
Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system.
Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining.
Year-to-date, this means -- year-to-date through November 7 that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital.
Operator, would you please open up the line for Q&A?"

The 2 big changes in the last 4, 5 years compared to the prior 4, 5 are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff; and then number two, in the case of HCP, a non-attributable increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period. And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be masked by your reimbursement per member per month increase because in the last 4, 5 years, instead of increases in those 2 areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million. I'm not going to get the number exactly right. Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years, has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI. And of course, it takes a while to restructure the business according to the new revenue reality. Is that responsive?"

If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta, or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity, and so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and an unusual incidence of serious issues within that flu population. In the first quarter, the derivative benefit from all that extra care and cost is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for a significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture. So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one the subsequent year. To be honest, from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the cost and the revenue's deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue."

Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's very difficult -- impossible would be a better word, to predict. You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they were making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business while, at the same time, complaining about the exchanges that, that pressure has also abated somewhat. So I want to repeat. It's still on the agenda, both of the plans and of the administration.

The 10b5-1 solves the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time. And we can't respond based on all the other factors. So we use both. When we do 10b5-1s, we tend to lean towards more complex plans to try and think forward about what's likely to happen, ensure that we're buying at opportune times.

Before we get into the specifics of our Q3 financial performance and outlook, we'll start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. First within the DaVita Medical Group, the opioid epidemic, of course, is getting a great amount of publicity and appropriately so. Our Everett Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program, where we implemented pain scoring tools, risk assessment, urine screens and training [ supportings ] for providers. And were recognized by the community for the exemplary leadership that we demonstrated. 
Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishments in the area of integrated care. If you look at the CSNPs that we've been involved with for 10 years or so, the outcomes are simply outstanding. Just to name a few, 25% reduction to hospitalizations, 49% fewer readmissions, 60% -- 66% lower PBC rates compared to the national average, et cetera, et cetera. And the recent ESCO data, both from us and others, further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. This is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENTS Act, where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishments.
As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable. It's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives nephrologists flexible and substantive participation options. More on that in the quarters to come.
But now I'll turn it over to Joel Ackerman to discuss DaVita Medical Group."
35644,540685601,1336801,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.Before I discuss the drivers of this d",591,"Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.
Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future.
As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of $16 million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter.
The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of 2 drivers: first, higher-than-expected medical costs, which represents about $30 million of impact. This is largely the result of 2 things: increased utilization driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement.
Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a $13 million item in 2016.
Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the 4 drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day. However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018.
Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons: First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring as I just mentioned; second, $30 million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase as I mentioned before; Third, we expect to benefit from 4 risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets; finally, we've been making progress in recontracting with payers in our legacy market and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements in terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business. Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018. We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed.
For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the 4 levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care."
35644,540685601,1336801,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the",863,"Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism in a time of real crisis. From working multiple shifts back to back to rescuing stranded patients in their boats, so they could be dialyzed, to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families, it was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates.
Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process.
The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017.
Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact.
Now I'm going to transition to proactively address 3 topics: charitable premium assistance, payer contracting and guiding. Let me start with charitable premium assistance.
As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to charitable premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize the 4 most important points: Point #1, charitable premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patients who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment; Point #2, we think charitable premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons; Point #3, even if charitable premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage despite facing significant financial hardship; Point #4, if this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately $100 million to $250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provided a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comments for Q&A.
For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide some additional color and try to be as helpful as I can. As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little more detail? What does this mean? 4 out of our 5 largest payers have raised [ lock ins ] the next 2 to 3 years, and we're currently negotiating [ assist ] in the normal cadence of renewals. For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-take negotiations. So some will end up, and some will end up down.
On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane.
Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018.
In our guidance, it's worth calling out 3 elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap: number one, open enrollment for ACA Plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decisions. Point #2, [ cost of medics ]. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet. And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a ballot initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range. Longer term, we continue to expect the multi-year trajectory to be consistent with what we said at the Capital Markets Day earlier this year.
Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international."

For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes a $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. These restructuring charges related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level. We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international costs starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirmed international OI guidance we provided last quarter.
Looking forward, we continue to expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses.
Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of 4 days over the last 2 quarters due to the following: As a reminder, 1 day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the 4 days were the result of 3 things: first, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which result -- which contributed 1 day. We expect our DSOs to decline 3 to 4 days over the next few quarters as we work through these items.
Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately 3 days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital. We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

I'd like to offer a few thoughts on 3 topics: number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks.
While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt have already noted.  It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results.
We are intensely focused on effecting a change in the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. Steps like the $40 million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are solely in our control. Many others involve third parties and therefore, are difficult to time.
I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates acted ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above board, explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act. We have a responsibility, both regulatorily (sic) and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients.
And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are 2 subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare secondary payer statute or commercial coverage. Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way, unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for.
Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system.
Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining.
Year-to-date, this means -- year-to-date through November 7 that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital.
Operator, would you please open up the line for Q&A?"

The 2 big changes in the last 4, 5 years compared to the prior 4, 5 are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff; and then number two, in the case of HCP, a non-attributable increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period. And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be masked by your reimbursement per member per month increase because in the last 4, 5 years, instead of increases in those 2 areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million. I'm not going to get the number exactly right. Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years, has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI. And of course, it takes a while to restructure the business according to the new revenue reality. Is that responsive?"

If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta, or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity, and so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and an unusual incidence of serious issues within that flu population. In the first quarter, the derivative benefit from all that extra care and cost is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for a significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture. So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one the subsequent year. To be honest, from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the cost and the revenue's deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue."

Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's very difficult -- impossible would be a better word, to predict. You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they were making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business while, at the same time, complaining about the exchanges that, that pressure has also abated somewhat.

The challenge there is the window does close at times, and we obviously can't trade when the window is closed. So that removes certain flexibility. The 10b5-1 solves the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time. And we can't respond based on all the other factors. So we use both.

Before we get into the specifics of our Q3 financial performance and outlook, we'll start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. First within the DaVita Medical Group, the opioid epidemic, of course, is getting a great amount of publicity and appropriately so. Our Everett Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program, where we implemented pain scoring tools, risk assessment, urine screens and training [ supportings ] for providers. And were recognized by the community for the exemplary leadership that we demonstrated. 
Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishments in the area of integrated care. If you look at the CSNPs that we've been involved with for 10 years or so, the outcomes are simply outstanding. Just to name a few, 25% reduction to hospitalizations, 49% fewer readmissions, 60% -- 66% lower PBC rates compared to the national average, et cetera, et cetera. And the recent ESCO data, both from us and others, further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. This is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENTS Act, where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishments.
As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable. It's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives nephrologists flexible and substantive participation options. More on that in the quarters to come.
But now I'll turn it over to Joel Ackerman to discuss DaVita Medical Group."
35644,540685601,1341480,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.Before I discuss the drivers of this d",591,"Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.
Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future.
As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of $16 million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter.
The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of 2 drivers: first, higher-than-expected medical costs, which represents about $30 million of impact. This is largely the result of 2 things: increased utilization driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement.
Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a $13 million item in 2016.
Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the 4 drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day. However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018.
Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons: First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring as I just mentioned; second, $30 million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase as I mentioned before; Third, we expect to benefit from 4 risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets; finally, we've been making progress in recontracting with payers in our legacy market and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements in terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business. Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018. We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed.
For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the 4 levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care."
35644,540685601,1341480,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the",863,"Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers who responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter.  As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism in a time of real crisis. From working multiple shifts back to back to rescuing stranded patients in their boats, so they could be dialyzed, to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families, it was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates.
Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process.
The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017.
Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact.
Now I'm going to transition to proactively address 3 topics: charitable premium assistance, payer contracting and guiding. Let me start with charitable premium assistance.
As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to charitable premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize the 4 most important points: Point #1, charitable premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patients who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment; Point #2, we think charitable premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons; Point #3, even if charitable premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage despite facing significant financial hardship; Point #4, if this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately $100 million to $250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provided a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comments for Q&A.
For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide some additional color and try to be as helpful as I can. As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little more detail? What does this mean? 4 out of our 5 largest payers have raised [ lock ins ] the next 2 to 3 years, and we're currently negotiating [ assist ] in the normal cadence of renewals. For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-take negotiations. So some will end up, and some will end up down.
On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane.
Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018.
In our guidance, it's worth calling out 3 elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap: number one, open enrollment for ACA Plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decisions. Point #2, [ cost of medics ]. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet. And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a ballot initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range. Longer term, we continue to expect the multi-year trajectory to be consistent with what we said at the Capital Markets Day earlier this year.
Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international."

For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes a $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. These restructuring charges related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level. We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international costs starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirmed international OI guidance we provided last quarter.
Looking forward, we continue to expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses.
Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of 4 days over the last 2 quarters due to the following: As a reminder, 1 day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the 4 days were the result of 3 things: first, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which result -- which contributed 1 day. We expect our DSOs to decline 3 to 4 days over the next few quarters as we work through these items.
Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately 3 days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital. We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.
Now over to Kent for a few closing comments."

I'd like to offer a few thoughts on 3 topics: number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks.
While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt have already noted.  It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results.
We are intensely focused on effecting a change in the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. Steps like the $40 million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are solely in our control. Many others involve third parties and therefore, are difficult to time.
I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates acted ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above board, explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act. We have a responsibility, both regulatorily (sic) and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients.
And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are 2 subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare secondary payer statute or commercial coverage. Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way, unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for.
Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system.
Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining.
Year-to-date, this means -- year-to-date through November 7 that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital.
Operator, would you please open up the line for Q&A?"

The 2 big changes in the last 4, 5 years compared to the prior 4, 5 are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff; and then number two, in the case of HCP, a non-attributable increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period. And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be masked by your reimbursement per member per month increase because in the last 4, 5 years, instead of increases in those 2 areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million. I'm not going to get the number exactly right. Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years, has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI. And of course, it takes a while to restructure the business according to the new revenue reality. Is that responsive?"

If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta, or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity, and so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and an unusual incidence of serious issues within that flu population. In the first quarter, the derivative benefit from all that extra care and cost is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for a significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture. So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one the subsequent year. To be honest, from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the cost and the revenue's deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue."

Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's very difficult -- impossible would be a better word, to predict. You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they were making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business while, at the same time, complaining about the exchanges that, that pressure has also abated somewhat.

The challenge there is the window does close at times, and we obviously can't trade when the window is closed. So that removes certain flexibility. The 10b5-1 solves the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time. And we can't respond based on all the other factors. So we use both.

I do have a CPA question for you, Kent. What we've heard from a number of plans is that they feel they're under no legal obligation to [ tick up a cap on ] and as they have rescinded some of these policies and refuse to accept checks and wire transfer to AKF. Instead, they're now seeing a lot of these patients paying with a prepaid debit card, and in fact, that those cards are going to the dialysis centers care of patients [ and the ] dialysis administrative personnel are helping these patients pay those premiums. And I guess, my question is, given your view that this is an acceptable and sustainable part of the ecosystem, why is it necessary for the AKF to potentially hide the origin of that funding? And is there any business risk to DaVita in essentially being complicit of [indiscernible] these [ plan terms did cover it ] if they decided not to accept those payments?"

Second, there couldn't be anything more explicit and more public than provider funding of the AKF in the entire pantheon of American health care, and it's how it's been for 20 years. It's how the government approved it, consistent with criteria the government set down. But I cannot opine on exactly operationally how that comes up. I also know that the overwhelming majority of payers, a huge percentage, I'm not going to get the number right, but overwhelming majority probably understates it, are continuing to process charitable premium assistance claims in the same way they did a year or 2 or 3 ago.
