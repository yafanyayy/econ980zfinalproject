And the financial and operational results that our team produced during the year demonstrate the enduring strength of our long-term infrastructure investment strategy. 
The customer-focused investments we're making are enhancing the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems as well as customer service and employee training, all of which supported earnings and dividend growth for our investors. 
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2016 and early 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share, non-GAAP, of $1.09, which compares to $0.94 in 2015 and is near the upper end of our 2016 guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. 
We invested a record $1.5 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states. The value these investments deliver included replacement of 406 miles of priority pipe, 12% more than in 2015, driving continued reductions in leaks, outages and emissions. In addition, we replaced 60 miles of underground cable and more than 1,200 electric poles, improving electric reliability for our Indiana customers. 
We also completed significant regulatory initiatives supporting these investments across our footprint. These included gas base rate case settlement approvals in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania; and just last month, reaching a settlement agreement in Virginia as well as approvals of settlements in our long-term electric modernization program and electric base rate case in Indiana; and finally, infrastructure tracker updates in several states. 
We're committed to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through these continued gas modernization investments and planned coal-fired plant retirements as we diversify our electric generation portfolio. In fact, in early 2016, we became a charter member of the U.S. EPA's Methane Challenge Program, committing to reduce our methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet over 5 years. 
We also added about 33,000 new customers in 2016, our best year for customer growth in a decade. The growth was driven by a number of factors, including an increase in gas conversions from other fuels, recovery in the new housing market and low customer attrition. 
With our continuing track record of producing strong results and the confidence that we have the right business plan and the right team in place, we are reaffirming our net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share for 2017. 
In addition, we now expect to invest about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our infrastructure this year, up from our prior estimate of $1.5 billion. The increase is driven primarily by investments on the electric side related to increasing service reliability and repositioning of our generation fleet. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments we first outlined in 2014. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."

On an opera",674,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. As Joe mentioned earlier, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016 compared with about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $894 million for the year, which is an increase of about $62 million over the same year in 2015. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $858 million for 2016 versus about $800 million in 2015. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continued to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure investments. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment level results. Our gas distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016, an increase of about $30 million from 2015. And our electric operations segment reported operating earnings of about $302 million in 2016, an increase of about $23 million from 2015. 
These increases were driven primarily by higher net revenues from returns earned on our infrastructure investments across our 7 states. And as Joe mentioned, our net operating earnings for the year came in near the upper end of our guidance range. And our solid overall results demonstrate the strength of our investment-driven plan. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available on our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $7.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.9% at the end of 2015. 
At the end of the year, we maintained net available liquidity of about $684 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. I'll note that we increased our credit facility by $350 million to $1.85 billion during the fourth quarter to provide additional liquidity and support for our capital investment program. 
It's also worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource a BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth. 
But before turning the call back to Joe, I'd like to briefly address federal tax reform, which we know is a topic that many of you are tracking closely. As with any potential legislation that could affect our customers and shareholders, NiSource is actively monitoring the discussions and working with our industry partners at AGA and EEI as well as elected officials to help shape a balanced and constructive outcome. 
Our objective in this policy effort are to retain interest deductibility, ensure fair and effective transition rules while also balancing the interests of our customers and our shareholders. I'd also say it's way too early to comment specifically on tax reform. However, I would note that as a 100% regulated company, most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings. 
Sorry, I think we're having a fire drill here. We're going to check on that. I'll continue till we get noticed. 
So where was I? I'd say it's too early. We are a 100% regulated company, and so most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings and only a modest potential impact on cash flow. 
The primary exposure NiSource has under some current proposals is related to a portion of our corporate level debt not capitalized in regulated operating companies or our current investment programs. Therefore, eliminating the deductibility of interest and/or reducing the corporate tax rate below the current 35% would have a modest dilutive impact on consolidated earnings. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,415814786,1138361,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2017",2017-02-22,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald.

We have continued to execute on our well-established customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, we're focused on delivering our results the right way with our customers, communities, employees and investors in mind. 
In 2016, we received several recognitions for doing just that. For instance, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the third straight year. The Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth year in a row. And we were named by Forbes magazine as one of America's best large employers, an honor based on independent surveys of employees at the nation's largest organizations. 
We're also continuing to provide programs and services that can help our customers reduce energy usage and manage their bills. For instance, in December, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a plan by Columbia Gas of Ohio to continue offering its energy efficiency programs for another 6 years. We expect that approximately 700,000 customers will benefit from these programs during that period, helping them save money by reducing their gas, electric and water usage. 
Since the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, NiSource has produced a total shareholder return of nearly 41%, outperforming the Dow Jones Utility Index. And in November, we were ranked #1 for total shareholder return among mid-cap electric companies over a 5-year period by the Edison Electric Institute. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. New rates became effective December 19 at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania following Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval in October of a joint settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the continued upgrade and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The new rates increase annual revenue by $35 million and the settlement includes incentives to expand gas service to commercial customers. 
In Virginia, we reached a settlement in January with all parties to our base rate case pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The settlement, if approved as filed, would allow for about a $29 million annual revenue increase. We filed the rate request in April 2016 seeking to adjust base rates to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system. The case also supports the growth of our Virginia system, driven by increased consumer demand for service. Updated interim base rates, subject to refund, were implemented in September. 
On February 8, a hearing examiner recommended approval of the settlement without modification, and a commission decision is expected in the first half of 2017. 
In Kentucky, we implemented new base rates on December 27 following Kentucky Public Service Commission modification and approval of our base rate case settlement agreement. The approval includes an annual revenue increase of about $13 million and will allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments. 
In Maryland, we implemented new base rates on October 27 following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approval increases annual revenue by about $4 million and supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and increased pipeline safety investments. 
In Massachusetts, we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. The settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably."

Although I will say as we keep safety as our top early in all that we do, important that we respond to these kind of incidents appropriately. So thanks for your patience, and we'll pick up right where we left off. 
I was updating on our gas business segment and regulatory activities had gone through a number of the states. I'll resume with the Massachusetts story, where we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. That settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. 
In Indiana, we continued to execute on our 7-year $824 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. 
On December 28, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved our semiannual tracker update covering about $67 [ph] million of investments that were made in the first half of 2016 under this program. 
Several other NiSource utilities also filed annual tracker updates related to their gas infrastructure modernization programs. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement program, Columbia Gas of Virginia under Virginia's SAVE Act program and Columbia Gas of Maryland under its Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement program. 
Combined, these filings provide for recovery of about $125 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability. The SAVE and stride updates were approved in December. 
In Massachusetts, we expect a Department of Public Utility's order prior May 1, 2017, when the updated schedule to be implemented. 
As you can see, across our gas utilities, we had a robust list of accomplishments on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts to wrap up 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On November 1, NIPSCO submitted its integrated resource plan to the IURC. It outlines NIPSCO's plan to meet its customers' anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable, clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes. 
Under the plan, NIPSCO would retire 50% [ph] of its coal-fired generating fleet by the end of 2023, including daily [ph] generating station units, 7 and 8, and RM Schaeffer [ph] generating station units, 17 and 18. 
The Mid-Continent Independent system operator has approved closure of daily [ph] units 7 and 8 by mid-2018. Also, as outlined in the plan, on November 1, NIPSCO requested IURC approval to invest approximately $400 million in required environmental upgrades at its Michigan City Unit 12 and Schaeffer units 14 and 15 generating facilities. 
New rates became effective October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement, which was approved by the IURC on July 18. The settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments and service improvements for customers and increases NIPSCO's annual revenues by about $73 million. 
We're also focused in Indiana on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems designed to improve safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of investments to be made through 2022. We began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments this month. 
And finally, our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 KB and 65 [ph] miles 765 [ph] KB projects are designed to enhance regionalized system flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are underway for both projects. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to remind everyone of our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 in New York City, that's in 2 weeks. The event will begin at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and I will be joined there were other members of NiSource's senior management team to discuss in detail the company's regulated utility infrastructure investment strategy. The event will be webcast live on nisource.com. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways for the year in our long-term investment proposition. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to enhance value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share in 2017 with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. 
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend every year while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

As Joe mentioned earlier, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016 compared with about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015. On an opera",674,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. As Joe mentioned earlier, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016 compared with about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $894 million for the year, which is an increase of about $62 million over the same year in 2015. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $858 million for 2016 versus about $800 million in 2015. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continued to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure investments. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment level results. Our gas distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016, an increase of about $30 million from 2015. And our electric operations segment reported operating earnings of about $302 million in 2016, an increase of about $23 million from 2015. 
These increases were driven primarily by higher net revenues from returns earned on our infrastructure investments across our 7 states. And as Joe mentioned, our net operating earnings for the year came in near the upper end of our guidance range. And our solid overall results demonstrate the strength of our investment-driven plan. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available on our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $7.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.9% at the end of 2015. 
At the end of the year, we maintained net available liquidity of about $684 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. I'll note that we increased our credit facility by $350 million to $1.85 billion during the fourth quarter to provide additional liquidity and support for our capital investment program. 
It's also worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource a BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth. 
But before turning the call back to Joe, I'd like to briefly address federal tax reform, which we know is a topic that many of you are tracking closely. As with any potential legislation that could affect our customers and shareholders, NiSource is actively monitoring the discussions and working with our industry partners at AGA and EEI as well as elected officials to help shape a balanced and constructive outcome. 
Our objective in this policy effort are to retain interest deductibility, ensure fair and effective transition rules while also balancing the interests of our customers and our shareholders. I'd also say it's way too early to comment specifically on tax reform. However, I would note that as a 100% regulated company, most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings. 
Sorry, I think we're having a fire drill here. We're going to check on that. I'll continue till we get noticed. 
So where was I? I'd say it's too early. We are a 100% regulated company, and so most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings and only a modest potential impact on cash flow. 
The primary exposure NiSource has under some current proposals is related to a portion of our corporate level debt not capitalized in regulated operating companies or our current investment programs. Therefore, eliminating the deductibility of interest and/or reducing the corporate tax rate below the current 35% would have a modest dilutive impact on consolidated earnings. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

We have continued to execute on our well-established customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, we're focused on delivering our results the right way with our customers, communities, employees and investors in mind. 
In 2016, we received several recognitions for doing just that. For instance, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the third straight year. The Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth year in a row. And we were named by Forbes magazine as one of America's best large employers, an honor based on independent surveys of employees at the nation's largest organizations. 
We're also continuing to provide programs and services that can help our customers reduce energy usage and manage their bills. For instance, in December, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a plan by Columbia Gas of Ohio to continue offering its energy efficiency programs for another 6 years. We expect that approximately 700,000 customers will benefit from these programs during that period, helping them save money by reducing their gas, electric and water usage. 
Since the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, NiSource has produced a total shareholder return of nearly 41%, outperforming the Dow Jones Utility Index. And in November, we were ranked #1 for total shareholder return among mid-cap electric companies over a 5-year period by the Edison Electric Institute. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. New rates became effective December 19 at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania following Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval in October of a joint settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the continued upgrade and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The new rates increase annual revenue by $35 million and the settlement includes incentives to expand gas service to commercial customers. 
In Virginia, we reached a settlement in January with all parties to our base rate case pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The settlement, if approved as filed, would allow for about a $29 million annual revenue increase. We filed the rate request in April 2016 seeking to adjust base rates to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system. The case also supports the growth of our Virginia system, driven by increased consumer demand for service. Updated interim base rates, subject to refund, were implemented in September. 
On February 8, a hearing examiner recommended approval of the settlement without modification, and a commission decision is expected in the first half of 2017. 
In Kentucky, we implemented new base rates on December 27 following Kentucky Public Service Commission modification and approval of our base rate case settlement agreement. The approval includes an annual revenue increase of about $13 million and will allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments. 
In Maryland, we implemented new base rates on October 27 following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approval increases annual revenue by about $4 million and supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and increased pipeline safety investments. 
In Massachusetts, we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. The settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably."

Although I will say, as we keep safety as our top early in all that we do, important that we respond to these kind of incidents appropriately. So thanks for your patience. 
And we'll pick up right where we left off. I was updating on our gas business segment and regulatory activities, had gone through a number of the states. I'll resume with the Massachusetts story, where we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. That settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. 
In Indiana, we continued to execute on our 7-year $824 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. On December 28, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved our semiannual tracker update, covering about $67 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2016 under this program. 
Several other NiSource utilities also filed annual tracker updates related to their gas infrastructure modernization programs. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement program, Columbia Gas of Virginia under Virginia's SAVE Act program and Columbia Gas of Maryland under its Strategic Infrastructure Development & Enhancement program. Combined, these filings provide for recovery of about $125 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability. The SAVE and STRIDE updates were approved in December. 
In Massachusetts, we expect a department of public utility's order prior May 1, 2017, when the update is scheduled to be implemented. 
As you can see, across our gas utilities, we had a robust list of accomplishments on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts to wrap up 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On November 1, NIPSCO submitted its integrated resource plan to the IURC. It outlines NIPSCO's plan to meet its customers' anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable, clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes. 
Under the plan, NIPSCO would retire 50% of its coal-fired generating fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station units 7 and 8, and R.M. Schahfer generating station units 17 and 18. The mid-continent independent system operator has approved closure of Bailey units 7 and 8 by mid-2018. 
Also as outlined in the plan, on November 1, NIPSCO requested IURC approval to invest approximately $400 million in required environmental upgrades at its Michigan City unit 12 and Schahfer units 14 and 15 generating facilities. 
New rates became effective October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement which was approved by the IURC on July 18. The settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments and service improvements for customers and increases NIPSCO's annual revenues by about $73 million. 
We're also focused in Indiana on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems designed to improve safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of investments to be made through 2022. We began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments this month. 
And finally, our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile, 345-kV and 65-mile, 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are underway for both projects. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to remind everyone of our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 in New York City. That's in 2 weeks. The event will begin at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. And I will be joined there were other members of NiSource's senior management team to discuss in detail the company's regulated utility infrastructure investment strategy. The event will be webcast live on nisource.com. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways for the year in our long-term investment proposition. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to enhance value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share in 2017 with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. 
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend every year while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

And the financial and operational results that our team produced during the year demonstrate the enduring strength of our long-term infrastructure investment strategy. 
The customer-focused investments we're making are enhancing the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems as well as customer service and employee training, all of which supported earnings and dividend growth for our investors. 
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2016 and early 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share, non-GAAP, of $1.09, which compares to $0.94 in 2015 and is near the upper end of our 2016 guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. 
We invested a record $1.5 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states. The value these investments deliver included replacement of 406 miles of priority pipe, 12% more than in 2015, driving continued reductions in leaks, outages and emissions. In addition, we replaced 60 miles of underground cable and more than 1,200 electric poles, improving electric reliability for our Indiana customers. 
We also completed significant regulatory initiatives supporting these investments across our footprint. These included gas base rate case settlement approvals in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania; and just last month, reaching a settlement agreement in Virginia as well as approvals of settlements in our long-term electric modernization program and electric base rate case in Indiana; and finally, infrastructure tracker updates in several states. 
We're committed to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through these continued gas modernization investments and planned coal-fired plant retirements as we diversify our electric generation portfolio. In fact, in early 2016, we became a charter member of the U.S. EPA's Methane Challenge Program, committing to reduce our methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet over 5 years. 
We also added about 33,000 new customers in 2016, our best year for customer growth in a decade. The growth was driven by a number of factors, including an increase in gas conversions from other fuels, recovery in the new housing market and low customer attrition. 
With our continuing track record of producing strong results and the confidence that we have the right business plan and the right team in place, we are reaffirming our net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share for 2017. 
In addition, we now expect to invest about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our infrastructure this year, up from our prior estimate of $1.5 billion. The increase is driven primarily by investments on the electric side related to increasing service reliability and repositioning  our generation fleet. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments we first outlined in 2014. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."

The settlement, if approved as filed, would allow for about a $29 million annual revenue increase. We filed the rate request in April 2016 seeking to adjust base rates to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system. The case also supports the growth of our Virginia system, driven by increased consumer demand for service. Updated interim base rates, subject to refund, were implemented in September. 
On February 8, a hearing examiner recommended approval of the settlement without modification, and a commission decision is expected in the first half of 2017. 
In Kentucky, we implemented new base rates on December 27 following Kentucky Public Service Commission modification and approval of our base rate case settlement agreement. The approval includes an annual revenue increase of about $13 million and will allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments. 
In Maryland, we implemented new base rates on October 27 following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approval increases annual revenue by about $4 million and supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and increased pipeline safety investments. 
In Massachusetts, we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. The settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably."

And we'll pick up right where we left off. I was updating on our gas business segment and regulatory activities, had gone through a number of the states. I'll resume with the Massachusetts story, where we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. That settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. 
In Indiana, we continued to execute on our 7-year $824 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. On December 28, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved our semiannual tracker update, covering about $67 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2016 under this program. 
Several other NiSource utilities also filed annual tracker updates related to their gas infrastructure modernization programs. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement program, Columbia Gas of Virginia under Virginia's SAVE Act program and Columbia Gas of Maryland under its Strategic Infrastructure Development & Enhancement program. Combined, these filings provide for recovery of about $125 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability. The SAVE and STRIDE updates were approved in December. 
In Massachusetts, we expect a department of public utility's order prior to May 1, 2017, when the update is scheduled to be implemented. 
As you can see, across our gas utilities, we had a robust list of accomplishments on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts to wrap up 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On November 1, NIPSCO submitted its integrated resource plan to the IURC. It outlines NIPSCO's plan to meet its customers' anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable, clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes. 
Under the plan, NIPSCO would retire 50% of its coal-fired generating fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station units 7 and 8, and R.M. Schahfer generating station units 17 and 18. The mid-continent independent system operator has approved closure of Bailey units 7 and 8 by mid-2018. 
Also as outlined in the plan, on November 1, NIPSCO requested IURC approval to invest approximately $400 million in required environmental upgrades at its Michigan City unit 12 and Schahfer units 14 and 15 generating facilities. 
New rates became effective October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement which was approved by the IURC on July 18. The settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments and service improvements for customers and increases NIPSCO's annual revenues by about $73 million. 
We're also focused in Indiana on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems designed to improve safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of investments to be made through 2022. We began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments this month. 
And finally, our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile, 345-kV and 65-mile, 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are underway for both projects. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to remind everyone of our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 in New York City. That's in 2 weeks. The event will begin at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. And I will be joined there by other members of NiSource's senior management team to discuss in detail the company's regulated utility infrastructure investment strategy. The event will be webcast live on nisource.com. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways for the year in our long-term investment proposition. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to enhance value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share in 2017 with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. 
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend every year while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

One final reminder. When comparing our full year 2016 results to 2015, keep in mind that we successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, and those results for CPG are now classified as discontinued operations. 
So with all that out of the way, the call is yours, Joe."

And the financial and operational results that our team produced during the year demonstrate the enduring strength of our long-term infrastructure investment strategy. 
The customer-focused investments we're making are enhancing the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems as well as customer service and employee training, all of which supported earnings and dividend growth for our investors. 
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2016 and early 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share, non-GAAP, of $1.09, which compares to $0.94 in 2015 and is near the upper end of our 2016 guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. 
We invested a record $1.5 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states. The value these investments deliver included replacement of 406 miles of priority pipe, 12% more than in 2015, driving continued reductions in leaks, outages and emissions. In addition, we replaced 60 miles of underground cable and more than 1,200 electric poles, improving electric reliability for our Indiana customers. 
We also completed significant regulatory initiatives supporting these investments across our footprint. These included gas base rate case settlement approvals in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania; and just last month, reaching a settlement agreement in Virginia as well as approvals of settlements in our long-term electric modernization program and electric base rate case in Indiana; and finally, infrastructure tracker updates in several states. 
We're committed to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through these continued gas modernization investments and planned coal-fired plant retirements as we diversify our electric generation portfolio. In fact, in early 2016, we became a charter member of the U.S. EPA's Methane Challenge Program, committing to reduce our methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet over 5 years. 
We also added about 33,000 new customers in 2016, our best year for customer growth in a decade. The growth was driven by a number of factors, including an increase in gas conversions from other fuels, recovery in the new housing market and low customer attrition. 
With our continuing track record of producing strong results and the confidence that we have the right business plan and the right team in place, we are reaffirming our net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share for 2017. 
In addition, we now expect to invest about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our infrastructure this year, up from our prior estimate of $1.5 billion. The increase is driven primarily by investments on the electric side related to increasing service reliability and repositioning  our generation fleet. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments we first outlined in 2014. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."

As Joe mentioned earlier, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016 compared with about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $894 million for the year, which is an increase of about $62 million over the same year in 2015. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $858 million for 2016 versus about $800 million in 2015. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continued to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure investments. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment level results. Our gas distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016, an increase of about $30 million from 2015. And our electric operations segment reported operating earnings of about $302 million in 2016, an increase of about $23 million from 2015. 
These increases were driven primarily by higher net revenues from returns earned on our infrastructure investments across our 7 states. And as Joe mentioned, our net operating earnings for the year came in near the upper end of our guidance range. And our solid overall results demonstrate the strength of our investment-driven plan. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available on our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $7.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.9% at the end of 2015. 
At the end of the year, we maintained net available liquidity of about $684 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. I'll note that we increased our credit facility by $350 million to $1.85 billion during the fourth quarter to provide additional liquidity and support for our capital investment program. 
It's also worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource a BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth. 
But before turning the call back to Joe, I'd like to briefly address federal tax reform, which we know is a topic that many of you are tracking closely. As with any potential legislation that could affect our customers and shareholders, NiSource is actively monitoring the discussions and working with our industry partners at AGA and EEI as well as elected officials to help shape a balanced and constructive outcome. 
Our objectives in this policy effort are to retain interest deductibility, ensure fair and effective transition rules while also balancing the interests of our customers and our shareholders. I'd also say it's way too early to comment specifically on tax reform. However, I would note that as a 100% regulated company, most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings. 
Sorry, I think we're having a fire drill here. We're going to check on that. I'll continue till we get notice. 
So where was I? I'd say it's too early. We are a 100% regulated company, and so most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and have minimal to no impact on regulated earnings and only a modest potential impact on cash flow. 
The primary exposure NiSource has under some current proposals is related to a portion of our corporate level debt not capitalized in regulated operating companies or our current investment programs. Therefore, eliminating the deductibility of interest and/or reducing the corporate tax rate below the current 35% would have a modest dilutive impact on consolidated earnings. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

We have continued to execute on our well-established customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, we're focused on delivering our results the right way with our customers, communities, employees and investors in mind. 
In 2016, we received several recognitions for doing just that. For instance, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the third straight year. The Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth year in a row. And we were named by Forbes magazine as one of America's best large employers, an honor based on independent surveys of employees at the nation's largest organizations. 
We're also continuing to provide programs and services that can help our customers reduce energy usage and manage their bills. For instance, in December, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a plan by Columbia Gas of Ohio to continue offering its energy efficiency programs for another 6 years. We expect that approximately 700,000 customers will benefit from these programs during that period, helping them save money by reducing their gas, electric and water usage. 
Since the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, NiSource has produced a total shareholder return of nearly 41%, outperforming the Dow Jones Utility Index. And in November, we were ranked #1 for total shareholder return among mid-cap electric companies over a 5-year period by the Edison Electric Institute. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. New rates became effective December 19 at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania following Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval in October of a joint settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the continued upgrade and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The new rates increase annual revenue by $35 million and the settlement includes incentives to expand gas service to commercial customers. 
In Virginia, we reached a settlement in January with all parties to our base rate case pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The settlement, if approved as filed, would allow for about a $29 million annual revenue increase. We filed the rate request in April 2016 seeking to adjust base rates to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system. The case also supports the growth of our Virginia system, driven by increased consumer demand for service. Updated interim base rates, subject to refund, were implemented in September. 
On February 8, a hearing examiner recommended approval of the settlement without modification, and a commission decision is expected in the first half of 2017. 
In Kentucky, we implemented new base rates on December 27 following Kentucky Public Service Commission modification and approval of our base rate case settlement agreement. The approval includes an annual revenue increase of about $13 million and will allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments. 
In Maryland, we implemented new base rates on October 27 following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approval increases annual revenue by about $4 million and supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and increased pipeline safety investments. 
In Massachusetts, we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. The settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015.

As you can see, across our gas utilities, we had a robust list of accomplishments on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts to wrap up 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On November 1, NIPSCO submitted its integrated resource plan to the IURC. It outlines NIPSCO's plan to meet its customers' anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable, clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes. 
Under the plan, NIPSCO would retire 50% of its coal-fired generating fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station units 7 and 8, and R.M. Schahfer generating station units 17 and 18. The mid-continent independent system operator has approved closure of Bailey units 7 and 8 by mid-2018. 
Also as outlined in the plan, on November 1, NIPSCO requested IURC approval to invest approximately $400 million in required environmental upgrades at its Michigan City unit 12 and Schahfer units 14 and 15 generating facilities. 
New rates became effective October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement which was approved by the IURC on July 18. The settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments and service improvements for customers and increases NIPSCO's annual revenues by about $73 million. 
We're also focused in Indiana on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems designed to improve safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of investments to be made through 2022. We began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments this month. 
And finally, our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile, 345-kV and 65-mile, 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are underway for both projects. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to remind everyone of our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 in New York City. That's in 2 weeks. The event will begin at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. And I will be joined there by other members of NiSource's senior management team to discuss in detail the company's regulated utility infrastructure investment strategy. The event will be webcast live on nisource.com. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways for the year in our long-term investment proposition. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to enhance value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share in 2017 with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. 
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend every year while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

NiSource started 2017 with strong first quarter financial and operational results. I'm proud of our talented and dedicated teams across NiSource, for delivering sustained value for our customers, community and investors. The long-term modernization programs underway in each of our stakes, provide clear and compelling investment opportunities, which our teams are effectively executing. 
Let's look at Slide 3 of r supplemental deck, and highlight some of our significant achievements thus far in 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share, non-GAAP of $0.71 compared to $0.62 during the same period in 2016. We're on plan to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 stakes this year. These financial results and investment levels have NiSource on track to deliver non-GAAP annual net operating earnings in the upper half of the company's 2017 guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Today we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in ACTA market or ATM equity issuance program. The ATM combined with future debt offerings in our well-established dividend reinvestment program is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's utility capital investments. Consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in March, we continue to expect to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend at 5% to 7% annually through 2020. We also expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs from 2018 through 2020. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. We're also continued to execute on our investment and regulatory programs across all 7 of our stakes. The early 2017 highlights include regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement in Virginia filing of a base rate case in Maryland, approvals of tracker update for gas infrastructure programs, in Massachusetts and Ohio. Filing of a long-term infrastructure replacement plan update in Ohio, and continued electric transmission, distribution and environmental investments in Indiana. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,427563786,1188128,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned earlier, certainly was a strong start of the year. And we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Now turning to Slide 4.",582,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned earlier, certainly was a strong start of the year. And we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. 
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016. On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $417 million for the quarter versus about $381 million in the first quarter of 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments. 
Let's now take a closer look at our segment level results. Our GAAP distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $364 million in the quarter, an increase of about $34 million compared with the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $63 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases, and infrastructure replacement program. This increased gas revenue was partially offset by an approximately $29 million increase in operating expenses related to increase O&M, depreciation expense and property taxes. Our electric operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $12 million from the first quarter of 2016. Once again, excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $24 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, and increase capital spending on the transmission projects. This increases electric revenue was $with partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $12 million, primarily, due to increased O&M, a portion of which is related to items formerly tracked or deferred that were rolled into these rates as a result of that it gives. 
Full details of our first quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com. 
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31, was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again, that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rate NiSource at BBB plus, Moody's at BAA2, and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth. I'd also like to highlight that we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with the approach we outlined at our Investor Day in March, and as part of our balance predictable approach to financing our infrastructure investment program. Keep in mind, that all of our financing costs are included in our updated 2017 earnings guidance. And at the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rate of 5% to 7%, through 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight a recognition we received that we're quite proud of. In March, the Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the 6th consecutive year. This designation supports our stakeholder commitments, and is influenced by our employees' actions in the systems and processes we have in place. Our commitment to doing the right thing crosses every aspect of our day-to-day business interactions, ensuring we serve our customers with fairness, honesty, integrity and trust day in and day out. And I would also like to encourage you to read $eat our 2016 integrated annual report, which was published in April. For the first time we combined our annual report to stockholders and our corporate sustainability report into a single publication. We did this to further illustrate how we've integrated our operational, financial and social performance across our business strategies. In addition to our financial performance, the report focuses on other sustainability issues, which are important to our stakeholders. Across both our gas and electric business segments, we're continuing to execute on our customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiative, and enhanced customer program, these investments are helping to improve system safety and reliability, customer service and response, and our system's environmental performance. 
Now let's turn to some spastic highlights for the first quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to make progress on our regulatory initiatives across all stakes. On the rate case front, we received approval of our settlement in Virginia, and also filed a new case in Maryland. The Virginia order received in March, related to our 2016 base rate case. It allows for about $29 million annual revenue increase and supports our continued investments related to safety, reliability and system growth. Maryland's request filed last month, supports continued replacement of Asian pipe and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the Maryland base rate adjustment would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. Our teams also continued to execute on our gas infrastructure replacement programs and make progress on tracker updates. Just week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of it's 2017 Gas System Enhancement Plan, which includes about $59 million of investments this year. 
In Indiana, we filed our semiannual tracker update in late February, covering approximately $61 million of investments made in the second half of 2016. And in Ohio, we received an order on April 26, on our annual infrastructure replacements program rider adjustment, covering $235 million of investments made in 2016. Also in Ohio, we filed for authority to continue our infrastructure replacement program through the end of 2022. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipes, and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In our electric business we've continued to focus on investments, which enhance safety, service reliability, environmental performance and customer service, as well as regulatory initiatives to support those investments. These include plans for environmental upgrades that certainly at our Michigan city and Schiffer generating stations. These investments estimated at $400 million are design to reduce our impact on local waterways, as well as coal ash omissions from these units, and keep our fleet in compliance with federal regulation. We're also focused on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planed through 2022. And we began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments effective in February 2017. Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV, and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
So as we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continued to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful regulatory outcomes in recent years support our high-value customer programs, things like pipeline and wire replacement, leak repair, enhance line locating and capabilities, vegetation management and electric generation investments. These investments are leading to positive customer outcomes with respect to safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems. We expect to deliver 2017 operating non-GAAP net operating earnings at the upper end of $1.12 to $1.18 per share guidance range. With about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. And we continue to expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, annually in our utility infrastructure from 2018 through 2020 and remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plan we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.

And then on the electric side, going from $109.5 billion into almost $124.5 billion. Percentage wise those are really big increases.

And it doesn't reflect a shift of formerly tracked or deferred items, that we rolled in through the base rate case cycle we've through over the past year and a half. So you're seeing some of that geography shift as well. And inside those cases, reflects commitments to some increased programs that we laid out in the various base rate cases, reliability, tree trimming program, those kinds of things. So I would characterize that not as indicative of expected ongoing growth, but a step that reflects our commitment to this level of spending and this level of customer value. That said, we expect it to flatten off here as we go forward and level off a bit as we go forward. And we did outline that at Investor Day. I think you want to add to that Donald?"

NiSource started 2017 with strong first quarter financial and operational results. I'm proud of our talented and dedicated teams across NiSource for delivering sustained value for our customers, community and investors. The long-term modernization programs underway in each of our states provide clear and compelling investment opportunities, which our teams are effectively executing.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements thus far in 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.71 compared to $0.62 during the same period in 2016. We're on plan to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states this year. These financial results and investment levels have NiSource on track to deliver non-GAAP annual net operating earnings in the upper half of the company's 2017 guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Today, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. The ATM, combined with future debt offerings, in our well-established dividend reinvestment program is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's utility capital investments.
Consistent with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, we continue to expect to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend at 5% to 7% annually through 2020. We also expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs from 2018 through 2020. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs across all 7 of our states. The early 2017 highlights include regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement in Virginia; filing of a base rate case in Maryland; approvals of tracker updates for gas infrastructure programs in Massachusetts and Ohio; filing of a long-term infrastructure replacement plan update in Ohio; and continued electric transmission, distribution and environmental investments in Indiana. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year, and we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.Now turning to Slide 4",580,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year, and we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016. On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $417 million for the quarter versus about $381 million in the first quarter of 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments.
Let's now take a closer look at our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $364 million in the quarter, an increase of about $34 million compared with the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $63 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased gas revenue was partially offset by an approximately $29 million increase in operating expenses related to increased O&M, depreciation expense and property taxes. Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $12 million from the first quarter of 2016. Once again, excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $24 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased capital spending on the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $12 million, primarily due to increased O&M, a portion of which is related to items formerly tracked or deferred that were rolled into base rates as a result of the rate case.
Full details of our first quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource a BBB+, Moody's a Baa2 and Fitch a BBB, all with stable outlook.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth. I'd also like to highlight that we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with the approach we outlined at our Investor Day in March and as part of our balanced, predictable approach to financing our infrastructure investment program. Keep in mind that all of our financing costs are included in our updated 2017 earnings guidance and the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight a recognition we received that we're quite proud of. In March, the Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year. This designation supports our stakeholder commitments and is influenced by our employees' actions and the systems and processes we have in place. Our commitment to doing the right thing crosses every aspect of our day-to-day business interactions, ensuring we serve our customers with fairness, honesty, integrity and trust day in and day out. And I would also like to encourage you to read our 2016 integrated annual report, which was published in April. For the first time, we combined our annual report to stockholders and our corporate sustainability report into a single publication. We did this to further illustrate how we've integrated our operational, financial and social performance across our business strategy. In addition to our financial performance, the report focuses on other sustainability issues, which are important to our stakeholders.
Across both our gas and electric business segments, we're continuing to execute on our customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, these investments are helping to improve system safety and reliability, customer service and response and our system's environmental performance.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to make progress on our regulatory initiatives across all states. On the rate case front, we received approval of our settlement in Virginia and also filed a new case in Maryland. The Virginia order received in March related to our 2016 base rate case. It allows for about a $29 million annual revenue increase and supports our continued investments related to safety, reliability and system growth. Maryland's request filed last month supports continued replacement of aging pipe and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the Maryland base rate adjustment would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million.
Our teams also continue to execute on our gas infrastructure replacement programs and make progress on tracker updates. Just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of its 2017 Gas System Enhancement Plan, which includes about $69 million of investments this year. 
In Indiana, we filed our semiannual tracker update in late February, covering approximately $61 million of investments made in the second half of 2016. And in Ohio, we received an order on April 26 on our annual infrastructure replacement program rider adjustment, covering $235 million of investments made in 2016. Also in Ohio, we filed for authority to continue our infrastructure replacement program through the end of 2022. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In our electric business, we've continued to focus on investments, which enhance safety, service reliability, environmental performance and customer service as well as regulatory initiatives to support those investments. These include plans for environmental upgrades at certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. These investments, estimated at $400 million, are design to reduce our impact on local water waste as well as coal ash emissions from these units and keep our fleet in compliance with federal regulations.
We're also focused on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planed through 2022, and we began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments effective in February of 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
So as we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful regulatory outcomes in recent years support our high-value customer programs, things like pipeline and wire replacement, leak repair, enhanced line locating and capabilities, vegetation management and electric generation investments. These investments are leading to positive customer outcomes with respect to safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems.
We expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings at the upper end of our $1.12 to $1.18 per share guidance range with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments, and we continue to expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure from 2018 through 2020 and remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

You kind of hit on one of the key themes. The first thing I'd say, though, is the O&M you're seeing in this quarter reflects our expected annual run rate fully ramped up now to the capabilities and investments that we set forth as we walked through the separation a couple of years ago. And it does reflect a shift of formerly tracked or deferred items that we rolled in through the base rate case cycle we've been through over the past year, 1.5 years. So you're seeing some of that geography shift as well. And inside those cases, reflects commitments to some increased programs that we laid out in the various base rate cases, reliability, tree trimming programs, those kinds of things. So I would characterize it not as indicative of expected ongoing growth, but a step that reflects our commitment to this level of spending and this level of customer value.

NiSource started 2017 with strong first quarter financial and operational results. I'm proud of our talented and dedicated teams across NiSource for delivering sustained value for our customers, community and investors. The long-term modernization programs under way in each of our states provide clear and compelling investment opportunities, which our teams are effectively executing.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements thus far in 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.71 compared to $0.62 during the same period in 2016. We're on plan to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states this year. These financial results and investment levels have NiSource on track to deliver non-GAAP annual net operating earnings in the upper half of the company's 2017 guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Today, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. The ATM, combined with future debt offerings in our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's utility capital investments.
Consistent with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, we continue to expect to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend at 5% to 7% annually through 2020. We also expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs from 2018 through 2020. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs across all 7 of our states. The early 2017 highlights include regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement in Virginia; filing of a base rate case in Maryland; approvals of tracker updates for gas infrastructure programs in Massachusetts and Ohio; filing of a long-term infrastructure replacement plan update in Ohio; and continued electric transmission, distribution and environmental investments in Indiana.

As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year, and we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016. On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $417 million for the quarter versus about $381 million in the first quarter of 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments.
Let's now take a closer look at our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $364 million in the quarter, an increase of about $34 million compared with the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $63 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased gas revenue was partially offset by an approximately $29 million increase in operating expenses related to increased O&M, depreciation expense and property taxes.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $12 million from the first quarter of 2016. Once again, excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $24 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased capital spending on the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $12 million, primarily due to increased O&M, a portion of which is related to items formerly tracked or deferred that were rolled into base rates as a result of the rate case.
Full details of our first quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth. I'd also like to highlight that we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with the approach we outlined at our Investor Day in March and is part of our balanced, predictable approach to financing our infrastructure investment program. Keep in mind that all of our financing costs are included in our updated 2017 earnings guidance and the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight a recognition we received that we're quite proud of. In March, the Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year. This designation supports our stakeholder commitments and is influenced by our employees' actions and the systems and processes we have in place. Our commitment to doing the right thing crosses every aspect of our day-to-day business interactions, ensuring we serve our customers with fairness, honesty, integrity and trust day in and day out. And I would also like to encourage you to read our 2016 integrated annual report, which was published in April. For the first time, we combined our annual report to stockholders and our corporate sustainability report into a single publication. We did this to further illustrate how we've integrated our operational, financial and social performance across our business strategy. In addition to our financial performance, the report focuses on other sustainability issues which are important to our stakeholders.
Across both our gas and electric business segments, we're continuing to execute on our customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, these investments are helping to improve system safety and reliability, customer service and response and our system's environmental performance.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to make progress on our regulatory initiatives across all states. On the rate case front, we received approval of our settlement in Virginia and also filed a new case in Maryland. The Virginia order received in March related to our 2016 base rate case. It allows for about a $29 million annual revenue increase and supports our continued investments related to safety, reliability and system growth. Maryland's request filed last month supports continued replacement of aging pipe and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the Maryland base rate adjustment would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million.
Our teams also continue to execute on our gas infrastructure replacement programs and make progress on tracker updates. Just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of its 2017 Gas System Enhancement Plan, which includes about $69 million of investments this year. 
In Indiana, we filed our semiannual tracker update in late February, covering approximately $61 million of investments made in the second half of 2016. And in Ohio, we received an order on April 26 on our annual infrastructure replacement program rider adjustment, covering $235 million of investments made in 2016. Also in Ohio, we filed for authority to continue our infrastructure replacement program through the end of 2022. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In our electric business, we've continued to focus on investments which enhance safety, service reliability, environmental performance and customer service as well as regulatory initiatives to support those investments. These include plans for environmental upgrades at certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. These investments, estimated at $400 million, are design to reduce our impact on local waterways as well as coal ash emissions from these units and keep our fleet in compliance with federal regulations.
We're also focused on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022, and we began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments effective in February of 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well under way for both projects.
So as we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful regulatory outcomes in recent years support our high-value customer programs, things like pipeline and wire replacement, leak repair, enhanced line locating and capabilities, vegetation management and electric generation investments. These investments are leading to positive customer outcomes with respect to safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems.
We expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings at the upper end of our $1.12 to $1.18 per share guidance range with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments, and we continue to expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure from 2018 through 2020 and remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

The first thing I'd say, though, is the O&M you're seeing in this quarter reflects our expected annual run rate fully ramped up now to the capabilities and investments that we set forth as we walked through the separation a couple of years ago. And it does reflect a shift of formerly tracked or deferred items that we rolled in through the base rate case cycle we've been through over the past year, 1.5 years. So you're seeing some of that geography shift as well. And inside those cases, reflects commitments to some increased programs that we laid out in the various base rate cases: reliability, tree trimming programs, those kinds of things. So I would characterize it not as indicative of expected ongoing growth, but a step that reflects our commitment to this level of spending and this level of customer value. That said, we expect it to flatten off here as we go forward and level off a bit as we go forward. And we did outline that at Investor Day. Anything you want to add to that, Donald?"

NiSource started 2017 with strong first quarter financial and operational results. I'm proud of our talented and dedicated teams across NiSource for delivering sustained value for our customers, community and investors. The long-term modernization programs underway in each of our states provide clear and compelling investment opportunities, which our teams are effectively executing.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements thus far in 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.71 compared to $0.62 during the same period in 2016. We're on plan to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our 7 states this year. These financial results and investment levels have NiSource on track to deliver non-GAAP annual net operating earnings in the upper half of the company's 2017 guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Today, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. The ATM, combined with future debt offerings in our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's utility capital investments.
Consistent with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, we continue to expect to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend at 5% to 7% annually through 2020. We also expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs from 2018 through 2020. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs across all 7 of our states. The early 2017 highlights include regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement in Virginia; filing of a base rate case in Maryland; approvals of tracker updates for gas infrastructure programs in Massachusetts and Ohio; filing of a long-term infrastructure replacement plan update in Ohio; and continued electric transmission, distribution and environmental investments in Indiana. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year, and we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.Now turning to Slide 4",580,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year, and we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016. On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $417 million for the quarter versus about $381 million in the first quarter of 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments.
Let's now take a closer look at our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $364 million in the quarter, an increase of about $34 million compared with the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $63 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased gas revenue was partially offset by an approximately $29 million increase in operating expenses related to increased O&M, depreciation expense and property taxes.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $12 million from the first quarter of 2016. Once again, excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $24 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased capital spending on the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $12 million, primarily due to increased O&M, a portion of which is related to items formerly tracked or deferred that were rolled into base rates as a result of the rate case.
Full details of our first quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth. I'd also like to highlight that we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with the approach we outlined at our Investor Day in March and is part of our balanced, predictable approach to financing our infrastructure investment program. Keep in mind that all of our financing costs are included in our updated 2017 earnings guidance and the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight a recognition we received that we're quite proud of. In March, the Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year. This designation supports our stakeholder commitments and is influenced by our employees' actions and the systems and processes we have in place. Our commitment to doing the right thing crosses every aspect of our day-to-day business interactions, ensuring we serve our customers with fairness, honesty, integrity and trust day in and day out. And I would also like to encourage you to read our 2016 integrated annual report, which was published in April. For the first time, we combined our annual report to stockholders and our corporate sustainability report into a single publication. We did this to further illustrate how we've integrated our operational, financial and social performance across our business strategy. In addition to our financial performance, the report focuses on other sustainability issues which are important to our stakeholders.
Across both our gas and electric business segments, we're continuing to execute on our customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, these investments are helping to improve system safety and reliability, customer service and response and our system's environmental performance.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to make progress on our regulatory initiatives across all states. On the rate case front, we received approval of our settlement in Virginia and also filed a new case in Maryland. The Virginia order received in March related to our 2016 base rate case. It allows for about a $29 million annual revenue increase and supports our continued investments related to safety, reliability and system growth. Maryland's request filed last month supports continued replacement of aging pipe and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the Maryland base rate adjustment would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million.
Our teams also continue to execute on our gas infrastructure replacement programs and make progress on tracker updates. Just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of its 2017 Gas System Enhancement Plan, which includes about $69 million of investments this year. 
In Indiana, we filed our semiannual tracker update in late February, covering approximately $61 million of investments made in the second half of 2016. And in Ohio, we received an order on April 26 on our annual infrastructure replacement program rider adjustment, covering $235 million of investments made in 2016. Also in Ohio, we filed for authority to continue our infrastructure replacement program through the end of 2022. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In our electric business, we've continued to focus on investments which enhance safety, service reliability, environmental performance and customer service as well as regulatory initiatives to support those investments. These include plans for environmental upgrades at certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. These investments, estimated at $400 million, are design to reduce our impact on local waterways as well as coal ash emissions from these units and keep our fleet in compliance with federal regulations.
We're also focused on executing our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022, and we began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments effective in February of 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
So as we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful regulatory outcomes in recent years support our high-value customer programs, things like pipeline and wire replacement, leak repair, enhanced line locating and capabilities, vegetation management and electric generation investments. These investments are leading to positive customer outcomes with respect to safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems.
We expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings at the upper end of our $1.12 to $1.18 per share guidance range with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments, and we continue to expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure from 2018 through 2020 and remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

But if I look at true core O&M, and let's start with the gas side, going from $200 million to $223 million and then on the electric side going from $109.5 million to almost $124.5 million. Percentage-wise, those are really big increases. And just curious if they're not covered via trackers, how much of that is creating lag for NiSource? And how much of that is already kind of embedded in forward-looking rates?"

You kind of hit on one of the key themes. The first thing I'd say, though, is the O&M you're seeing in this quarter reflects our expected annual run rate fully ramped up now to the capabilities and investments that we set forth as we walked through the separation a couple of years ago. And it does reflect a shift of formerly tracked or deferred items that we rolled in through the base rate case cycle we've been through over the past year, 1.5 years. So you're seeing some of that geography shift as well. And inside those cases, reflects commitments to some increased programs that we laid out in the various base rate cases: reliability, tree trimming programs, those kinds of things. So I would characterize it not as indicative of expected ongoing growth, but a step that reflects our commitment to this level of spending and this level of customer value. That said, we expect it to flatten off here as we go forward and level off a bit as we go forward. And we did outline that at Investor Day. Anything you want to add to that, Donald?"

During the second quarter, the NiSource team built on the strong foundation established at the start of 2017 and continued to drive value for our customers and investors by executing on our",407,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, the NiSource team built on the strong foundation established at the start of 2017 and continued to drive value for our customers and investors by executing on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer programs and on the financial product, successfully refinancing debt to capture interest expense savings opportunities.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our significant achievements so far this year. We delivered second quarter net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.10 compared to $0.08 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure this year with more than $820 million invested through the second quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. And we refinanced about $1 billion in debt during the quarter, which will drive interest expense savings over the next several years. 
As we announced in this morning's press release, the team's effective execution and the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with the successful outcome of our financing activities have led us to increase our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Taking into account this increased 2017 guidance range, we continue to expect, as we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% each year through 2020.
We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs. In Indiana, we reached a settlement agreement related to the CCR environmental upgrades we proposed for certain generating stations, and we received approval of the latest semi-annual tracker update associated with our gas modernization program. We also filed our second electric modernization tracker update request, and our electric transmission projects remain on track to be in service in the second half of 2018. 
In Ohio, we're working with stakeholders on our application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure replacement program, and we've reached a settlement in our base rate case in Maryland.
On the customer growth front, we are slightly ahead of our plan. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,530149563,1262257,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Now turning to Slide 4. We delive",756,"Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. 
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $33 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter compared with about $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first half of 2017, our net operating earnings are up about $40 million or $0.11 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continue to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure practice. I would add that we built additional momentum during the quarter by successfully refinancing about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower rate debt, accelerating interest expense savings over the next several years. 
In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt, which we'll use to finance investments in our infrastructure modernization program. 
During the first quarter update, we noted that we had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. During the quarter, we issued about 1.3 million shares, receiving proceeds of nearly $34 million. As outlined at Investor Day, the ATM, combined with debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments and all financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 earnings guidance and our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $56 million in the quarter, a decrease of about $18 million compared with the same period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $22 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was offset by an approximately $40 million increase in operating expenses related to higher employee and administrative costs, increased outside service cost, depletion expenses -- depreciation expenses, property taxes and environmental costs. 
Our Electric Operations segment reports operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $20 million from the second quarter of 2016.
Net revenues were up about $42 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, increased investment in the transmission projects and increased industrial and commercial usage. This increased electric revenue with partially offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $22 million, primarily due to increased generation-related maintenance and vegetation management costs; increased employee administrative cost and higher growth receipts taxes.
Before moving on from our results, I'd like to add a little context around the increase in nontract O&M expenses.  In the Gas segment, we've made commitments in recent rate case settlement to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. In our electric business, we've increased the plant maintenance and vegetation management activities to boost our reliability. We're managing these expenses closely, and as we shared at Investor Day, we remain confident that our performance transformation process will lead to a flattening of O&M expenses after 2017.
Full details of our second quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com. 
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debit and credit -- debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.2 billion, of which, about $7.3 billion was a long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.9%. I would note that we've made significant progress to reduce our weighted average interest rate by nearly 100 basis points since separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. 
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,530149563,1262257,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work.

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes Magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017. We ranked 61st overall, a significant jump from last year's ranking and I'm proud to say that we were the top-rated utility company. Recognition like this reinforces and help spread the word that our 8,000 employees are creating a great place to work, grow and build a career. 
And in June, I joined the more than 150 CEOs of some of the world's leading companies to sign the CEO Action For Diversity and Inclusion Pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It was an easy decision to sign this pledge because at NiSource, we are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive culture in a diverse workforce. Our teams understand that diversity is important in order for us to deliver on the expectations of our customers. So we're proud to join with other leading organizations to affirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
We believe that if we provide our employees the right training and development opportunities and the right tools and technology, they will better serve our customers and communities. A great example of that is our continued modernization of our training program for our field operations employees. 
In May, we opened the second of 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in suburban Columbus. Our first center opened near Pittsburgh last summer and another is expected to open later this year in Virginia. Construction has also begun on a facility in Massachusetts that will open in 2018.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to execute on infrastructure modernization programs across all states and 2 advanced key regulatory initiatives, all while growing our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we received approval of our latest semi-annual tracker update covering approximately $61 million of investments that were made in the second half of 2016, which is part of a 7-year $845 million program to further improve system reliability and safety. In Ohio, our application for a 5-year extension of our infrastructure replacement program remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. Discussions with stakeholders continue following the PUCO staff's recommended approval with modifications last month. This well-established program authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. A PUCO order in the new filing is expected by the end of the year. 
On the rate case front, last week, we reached a settlement with all the parties to our request in Maryland. The case supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrade. If approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission, the settlement would result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million effective in late October. 
In May, new rates took effect with tracker updates in our Ohio infrastructure replacement program and our Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan, which combined, include more than $300 million of investments. 
Colombia Gas of Pennsylvania continues to execute on its robust modernization program as well with plans on track to invest more than $200 million in 2017. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Citizens Action Coalition and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers submitted a settlement agreement seeking, among other things, approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schaffer generating stations. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An RURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of this year.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. We filed our second semi-annual tracker update request in June, covering about $134 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service date in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide flexibility and reliability. Substation line and power construction are well underway for both projects. 
On the electric customer service front, I'm happy to report that last month, NIPSCO was recognized by J.D. Power as one of the most improved brands in the nation with a 59-point, or 9%, improvement in its score. This strong performance helps demonstrate that our electric modernization program is benefiting customers, and that our Indiana team, like all our teams, is focused on delivering the value our customers expect. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful refinancing efforts will result in interest expense savings, and our recent debt and equity issuances have generated low-cost capital to invest in our high-value modernization programs. We now expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share, and we remain on track to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments this year, continuing to execute on our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. 
With our robust investment plans and taking into account our increased earnings guidance range, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. 
So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in, and support of, NiSource.

Both insightful questions. Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020. And this year is a pretty significant step for us in building and implementing capabilities to market those opportunities directly, to build the policy arena, to support that and to build the capabilities to execute. And we're ahead of plan through the second quarter in terms of the additions we've seen and feel very confident that our progress toward that ultimate goal of 1% sustained run rate is well on hand and well inside for us. So I'd say encouragement confidence continues to grow. No significant change in our outlook for how these capabilities will ultimately fill in on the plan for us, but very good results so far.  On the O&M side, I would say we're on plan through the second quarter, and that's an important to note. The mix of factors drive that year-on-year change that you see led by the things Donald touched on earlier in the call, the commitments to safety, reliability and training that we made in the last round of rate cases. And on top of that, transformation initiatives that we've been talking about that have some of front-end investment required in customer service, in value-creating initiatives, and then ultimately also growing our capabilities to execute at the new higher capital investment levels you're seeing this year. Ultimately, all of that we expect to level off after 2017. So not so much timing issues within the year as it is about the build of capabilities and execution driven by all of those factors so far this year."

We delivered second quarter net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.10 compared to $0.08 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure this year with more than $820 million invested through the second quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. And we refinanced about $1 billion in debt during the quarter, which will drive interest expense savings over the next several years.
As we announced in this morning's press release, the team's effective execution and the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with the successful outcome of our financing activities have led us to increase our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Taking into account this increased 2017 guidance range, we continue to expect, as we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% each year through 2020.
We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs. In Indiana, we reached a settlement agreement related to the CCR environmental upgrades we've proposed for certain generating stations, and we received approval of the latest semi-annual tracker update associated with our gas modernization program. We also filed our second electric modernization tracker update request, and our electric transmission projects remain on track to be in service in the second half of 2018. 
In Ohio, we're working with stakeholders on our application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program, and we've reached a settlement in our base rate case in Maryland.
On the customer growth front, we are slightly ahead of our plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.Now turning to Slide 4. We del",757,"Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $33 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter compared with about $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first half of 2017, our net operating earnings are up about $40 million or $0.11 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would add that we've built additional momentum during the quarter by successfully refinancing about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower rate debt, accelerating interest expense savings over the next several years. 
In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt, which we'll use to finance investments in our infrastructure modernization programs.
During our first quarter update, we noted that we had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. During the quarter, we issued about 1.3 million shares, receiving proceeds of nearly $34 million. As outlined at Investor Day, the ATM, combined with debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 earnings guidance and our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $56 million in the quarter, a decrease of about $18 million compared with the same period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $22 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and Infrastructure Replacement Programs. This increased revenue was offset by an approximately $40 million increase in operating expenses related to higher employee and administrative costs, increased outside service cost, depletion expenses -- depreciation expenses, property taxes and environmental costs.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $20 million from the second quarter of 2016.
Net revenues were up about $42 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, increased investment in the transmission projects and increased industrial and commercial usage. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $22 million, primarily due to increased generation-related maintenance and vegetation management costs; increased employee administrative costs and higher growth receipts taxes.
Before moving on from our results, I'd like to add a little context around the increase in non-tracked O&M expenses. In the gas segment, we've made commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. In our electric business, we've increased the plant maintenance and vegetation management activities to boost our reliability. We're managing these expenses closely, and as we shared at Investor Day, we remain confident that our performance transformation process will lead to a flattening of O&M expenses after 2017.
Full details of our second quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debit and credit -- debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.2 billion, of which, about $7.3 billion was a long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.9%. I would note that we've made significant progress to reduce our weighted average interest rate by nearly 100 basis points since separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,530149563,1262702,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes ma",1028,"Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017. We ranked 61st overall, a significant jump from last year's rankings and I'm proud to say that we were the top-rated utility company. Recognition like this reinforces and help spread the word that our 8,000 employees are creating a great place to work, grow and build a career.
And in June, I joined more than 150 CEOs of some of the world's leading companies to sign the CEO Action For Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It was an easy decision to sign this pledge because at NiSource, we are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive culture in a diverse workforce. Our teams understand that diversity is important in order for us to deliver on the expectations of our customers. So we're proud to join with other leading organizations to affirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
We believe that if we provide our employees the right training and development opportunities and the right tools and technology, they will better serve our customers and communities. A great example of that is our continued modernization of our training program for our field operations employees.
In May, we opened the second of 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in suburban Columbus. Our first center opened near Pittsburgh last summer and another is expected to open later this year in Virginia. Construction has also begun on a facility in Massachusetts that will open in 2018.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across all states and to advance key regulatory initiatives, all while growing our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we received approval of our latest semi-annual tracker update covering approximately $61 million of investments that were made in the second half of 2016, which is part of a 7-year $845 million program to further improve system reliability and safety. In Ohio, our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. Discussions with stakeholders continue following the PUCO staff's recommended approval with modifications last month. This well-established program authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. A PUCO order in the new filing is expected by the end of the year. 
On the rate case front, last week, we reached a settlement with all parties to our request in Maryland. The case supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades. If approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission, the settlement would result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million effective in late October.
In May, new rates took effect with tracker updates in our Ohio Infrastructure Replacement Program and our Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan, which combined, include more than $300 million of investments. 
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania continues to execute on its robust modernization program as well with plans on track to invest more than $200 million in 2017. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Citizens Action Coalition and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers submitted a settlement agreement seeking, among other things, approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of this year.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. We filed our second semi-annual tracker update request in June, covering about $134 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
On the electric customer service front, I'm happy to report that last month, NIPSCO was recognized by J.D. Power as one of the most improved brands in the nation with a 59-point, or 9%, improvement in its score. This strong performance helps demonstrate that our electric modernization program is benefiting customers, and that our Indiana team, like all our teams, is focused on delivering the value our customers expect. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful refinancing efforts will result in interest expense savings, and our recent debt and equity issuances have generated low-cost capital to invest in our high-value modernization programs. We now expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share, and we remain on track to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments this year, continuing to execute our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities.
With our robust investment plans and taking into account our increased earnings guidance range, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.
So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

Both insightful questions. Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020. And this year is a pretty significant step for us in building and implementing capabilities to market those opportunities differently, to build the policy arena, to support that and to build the capabilities to execute. And we're ahead of plan through the second quarter in terms of the additions we've seen and feel very confident that our progress toward that ultimate goal of 1% sustained run rate is well on hand and well inside for us. So I'd say encouragement confidence continues to grow. No significant change in our outlook for how these capabilities will ultimately fill in on the plan for us, but very good results so far. On the O&M side, I would say we're on plan through the second quarter, and that's important to note. The mix of factors drive that year-on-year change that you see led by the things Donald touched on earlier in the call, the commitments to safety, reliability and training that we made in the last round of rate cases. And on top of that, transformation initiatives that we've been talking about that have some front-end investment required in customer service, in value-creating initiatives, and then ultimately also growing our capabilities to execute at the new higher capital investment levels you're seeing this year. Ultimately, all of that we expect to level off after 2017. So not so much timing issues within the year as it is about the build of capabilities and execution driven by all of those factors so far this year."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, the NiSource team built on the strong foundation established at the start of 2017 and continued to drive value for our customers and investors by executing on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer programs. And on the financial front, successfully refinancing debt to capture interest expense savings opportunities.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our significant achievements so far this year. We delivered second quarter net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.10 compared to $0.08 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure this year with more than $820 million invested through the second quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. And we refinanced about $1 billion in debt during the quarter, which will drive interest expense savings over the next several years.
As we announced in this morning's press release, the team's effective execution and the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with the successful outcome of our financing activities have led us to increase our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Taking into account this increased 2017 guidance range, we continue to expect, as we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% each year through 2020.
We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs. In Indiana, we reached a settlement agreement related to the CCR environmental upgrades we've proposed for certain generating stations, and we received approval of the latest semi-annual tracker update associated with our gas modernization program. We also filed our second electric modernization tracker update request, and our electric transmission projects remain on track to be in service in the second half of 2018. 
In Ohio, we're working with stakeholders on our application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program, and we've reached a settlement in our base rate case in Maryland.
On the customer growth front, we are slightly ahead of our plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,530149563,1263240,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.Now turning to Slide 4. We del",757,"Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $33 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter compared with about $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first half of 2017, our net operating earnings are up about $40 million or $0.11 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would add that we've built additional momentum during the quarter by successfully refinancing about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower rate debt, accelerating interest expense savings over the next several years. 
In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt, which we'll use to finance investments in our infrastructure modernization programs.
During our first quarter update, we noted that we had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. During the quarter, we issued about 1.3 million shares, receiving proceeds of nearly $34 million. As outlined at Investor Day, the ATM, combined with debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 earnings guidance and our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $56 million in the quarter, a decrease of about $18 million compared with the same period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $22 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and Infrastructure Replacement Programs. This increased revenue was offset by an approximately $40 million increase in operating expenses related to higher employee and administrative costs, increased outside service cost, depletion expenses -- depreciation expenses, property taxes and environmental costs.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $20 million from the second quarter of 2016.
Net revenues were up about $42 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, increased investment in the transmission projects and increased industrial and commercial usage. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $22 million, primarily due to increased generation-related maintenance and vegetation management costs; increased employee administrative costs and higher growth receipts taxes.
Before moving on from our results, I'd like to add a little context around the increase in non-tracked O&M expenses. In the gas segment, we've made commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. In our electric business, we've increased the plant maintenance and vegetation management activities to boost our reliability. We're managing these expenses closely, and as we shared at Investor Day, we remain confident that our performance transformation process will lead to a flattening of O&M expenses after 2017.
Full details of our second quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debit and credit -- debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.2 billion, of which, about $7.3 billion was a long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.9%. I would note that we've made significant progress to reduce our weighted average interest rate by nearly 100 basis points since separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,530149563,1263240,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work.

Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017. We ranked 61st overall, a significant jump from last year's rankings and I'm proud to say that we were the top-rated utility company. Recognition like this reinforces and helps spread the word that our 8,000 employees are creating a great place to work, grow and build a career.
And in June, I joined more than 150 CEOs of some of the world's leading companies to sign the CEO Action For Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It was an easy decision to sign this pledge because at NiSource, we are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive culture in a diverse workforce. Our teams understand that diversity is important in order for us to deliver on the expectations of our customers. So we're proud to join with other leading organizations to affirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
We believe that if we provide our employees the right training and development opportunities and the right tools and technology, they will better serve our customers and communities. A great example of that is our continued modernization of our training program for our field operations employees.
In May, we opened the second of 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in suburban Columbus. Our first center opened near Pittsburgh last summer and another is expected to open later this year in Virginia. Construction has also begun on a facility in Massachusetts that will open in 2018.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across all states and to advance key regulatory initiatives, all while growing our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we received approval of our latest semi-annual tracker update covering approximately $61 million of investments that were made in the second half of 2016, which is part of a 7-year $845 million program to further improve system reliability and safety. In Ohio, our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. Discussions with stakeholders continue following the PUCO staff's recommended approval with modifications last month. This well-established program authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. A PUCO order in the new filing is expected by the end of the year. 
On the rate case front, last week, we reached a settlement with all parties to our request in Maryland. The case supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades. If approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission, the settlement would result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million effective in late October.
In May, new rates took effect with tracker updates in our Ohio Infrastructure Replacement Program and our Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan, which combined, include more than $300 million of investments. 
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania continues to execute on its robust modernization program as well with plans on track to invest more than $200 million in 2017. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Citizens Action Coalition and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers submitted a settlement agreement seeking, among other things, approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of this year.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. We filed our second semi-annual tracker update request in June, covering about $134 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
On the electric customer service front, I'm happy to report that last month, NIPSCO was recognized by J.D. Power as one of the most improved brands in the nation with a 59-point, or 9%, improvement in its score. This strong performance helps demonstrate that our electric modernization program is benefiting customers, and that our Indiana team, like all our teams, is focused on delivering the value our customers expect. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful refinancing efforts will result in interest expense savings, and our recent debt and equity issuances have generated low-cost capital to invest in our high-value modernization programs. We now expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share, and we remain on track to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments this year, continuing to execute our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities.
With our robust investment plans and taking into account our increased earnings guidance range, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.
So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020",300,"Sure, Paul. Thanks. Both insightful questions. Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020. And this year is a pretty significant step for us in building and implementing capabilities to market those opportunities differently, to build the policy arena, to support that and to build the capabilities to execute. And we're ahead of plan through the second quarter in terms of the additions we've seen and feel very confident that our progress toward that ultimate goal of 1% sustained run rate is well on hand and well in sight for us. So I'd say encouragement confidence continues to grow. No significant change in our outlook for how these capabilities will ultimately fill in on the plan for us, but very good results so far. On the O&M side, I would say we're on plan through the second quarter, and that's important to note. The mix of factors drive that year-on-year change that you see led by the things Donald touched on earlier in the call, the commitments to safety, reliability and training that we made in the last round of rate cases. And on top of that, transformation initiatives that we've been talking about that have some front-end investment required in customer service, in value-creating initiatives, and then ultimately also growing our capabilities to execute at the new higher capital investment levels you're seeing this year.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, the NiSource team built on the strong foundation established at the start of 2017 and continued to drive value for our customers and investors by executing on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer programs. And on the financial front, successfully refinancing debt to capture interest expense savings opportunities.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our significant achievements so far this year. We delivered second quarter net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.10 compared to $0.08 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure this year with more than $820 million invested through the second quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. And we refinanced about $1 billion in debt during the quarter, which will drive interest expense savings over the next several years.
As we announced in this morning's press release, the team's effective execution and the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with the successful outcome of our financing activities have led us to increase our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Taking into account this increased 2017 guidance range, we continue to expect, as we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% each year through 2020.
We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs. In Indiana, we reached a settlement agreement related to the CCR environmental upgrades we've proposed for certain generating stations, and we received approval of the latest semi-annual tracker update associated with our gas modernization program. We also filed our second electric modernization tracker update request, and our electric transmission projects remain on track to be in service in the second half of 2018. 
In Ohio, we're working with stakeholders on our application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program, and we've reached a settlement in our base rate case in Maryland.
On the customer growth front, we are slightly ahead of our plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,530149563,1266549,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.Now turning to Slide 4. We del",757,"Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong, and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $33 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter compared with about $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first half of 2017, our net operating earnings are up about $40 million or $0.11 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would add that we've built additional momentum during the quarter by successfully refinancing about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower rate debt, accelerating interest expense savings over the next several years. 
In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt, which we'll use to finance investments in our infrastructure modernization programs.
During our first quarter update, we noted that we had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program. During the quarter, we issued about 1.3 million shares, receiving proceeds of nearly $34 million. As outlined at Investor Day, the ATM, combined with debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 earnings guidance and our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $56 million in the quarter, a decrease of about $18 million compared with the same period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $22 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and Infrastructure Replacement Programs. This increased revenue was offset by an approximately $40 million increase in operating expenses related to higher employee and administrative costs, increased outside service cost, depletion expenses -- depreciation expenses, property taxes and environmental costs.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $20 million from the second quarter of 2016.
Net revenues were up about $42 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, increased investment in the transmission projects and increased industrial and commercial usage. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $22 million, primarily due to increased generation-related maintenance and vegetation management costs; increased employee administrative costs and higher growth receipts taxes.
Before moving on from our results, I'd like to add a little context around the increase in non-tracked O&M expenses. In the gas segment, we've made commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. In our electric business, we've increased the plant maintenance and vegetation management activities to boost our reliability. We're managing these expenses closely, and as we shared at Investor Day, we remain confident that our performance transformation process will lead to a flattening of O&M expenses after 2017.
Full details of our second quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debit and credit -- debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.2 billion, of which, about $7.3 billion was a long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.9%. I would note that we've made significant progress to reduce our weighted average interest rate by nearly 100 basis points since separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks.
Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,530149563,1266549,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes ma",1028,"Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones, which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017. We ranked 61st overall, a significant jump from last year's rankings and I'm proud to say that we were the top-rated utility company. Recognition like this reinforces and helps spread the word that our 8,000 employees are creating a great place to work, grow and build a career.
And in June, I joined more than 150 CEOs of some of the world's leading companies to sign the CEO Action For Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It was an easy decision to sign this pledge because at NiSource, we are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive culture in a diverse workforce. Our teams understand that diversity is important in order for us to deliver on the expectations of our customers. So we're proud to join with other leading organizations to affirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
We believe that if we provide our employees the right training and development opportunities and the right tools and technology, they will better serve our customers and communities. A great example of that is our continued modernization of our training program for our field operations employees.
In May, we opened the second of 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in suburban Columbus. Our first center opened near Pittsburgh last summer and another is expected to open later this year in Virginia. Construction has also begun on a facility in Massachusetts that will open in 2018.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across all states and to advance key regulatory initiatives, all while growing our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we received approval of our latest semi-annual tracker update covering approximately $61 million of investments that were made in the second half of 2016, which is part of a 7-year $845 million program to further improve system reliability and safety. In Ohio, our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. Discussions with stakeholders continue following the PUCO staff's recommended approval with modifications last month. This well-established program authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. A PUCO order in the new filing is expected by the end of the year. 
On the rate case front, last week, we reached a settlement with all parties to our request in Maryland. The case supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades. If approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission, the settlement would result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million effective in late October.
In May, new rates took effect with tracker updates in our Ohio Infrastructure Replacement Program and our Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan, which combined, include more than $300 million of investments. 
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania continues to execute on its robust modernization program as well with plans on track to invest more than $200 million in 2017. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Citizens Action Coalition and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers submitted a settlement agreement seeking, among other things, approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of this year.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. We filed our second semi-annual tracker update request in June, covering about $134 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.
On the electric customer service front, I'm happy to report that last month, NIPSCO was recognized by J.D. Power as one of the most improved brands in the nation with a 59-point, or 9%, improvement in its score. This strong performance helps demonstrate that our electric modernization program is benefiting customers, and that our Indiana team, like all our teams, is focused on delivering the value our customers expect. 
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful refinancing efforts will result in interest expense savings, and our recent debt and equity issuances have generated low-cost capital to invest in our high-value modernization programs. We now expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share, and we remain on track to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments this year, continuing to execute our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities.
With our robust investment plans and taking into account our increased earnings guidance range, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.
So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

Both insightful questions. Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020. And this year is a pretty significant step for us in building and implementing capabilities to market those opportunities differently, to build the policy arena, to support that and to build the capabilities to execute. And we're ahead of plan through the second quarter in terms of the additions we've seen and feel very confident that our progress toward that ultimate goal of 1% sustained run rate is well on hand and well in sight for us. So I'd say encouragement confidence continues to grow. No significant change in our outlook for how these capabilities will ultimately fill in on the plan for us, but very good results so far. On the O&M side, I would say we're on plan through the second quarter, and that's important to note. The mix of factors drive that year-on-year change that you see led by the things Donald touched on earlier in the call, the commitments to safety, reliability and training that we made in the last round of rate cases. And on top of that, transformation initiatives that we've been talking about that have some front-end investment required in customer service, in value-creating initiatives, and then ultimately also growing our capabilities to execute at the new higher capital investment levels you're seeing this year. Ultimately, all of that we expect to level off after 2017. So not so much timing issues within the year as it is about the build of capabilities and execution driven by all of those factors so far this year."

NiSource continues to make progress on our customer-focused business plan delivering on our infrastructure investments regulatory initiatives and customer growth programs, while enhancing our capabilities through transformation initiatives.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our achievements so far this year. We delivered third quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.07 compared to a $0.06 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest an estimated $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in utility infrastructure this year, with more than $1.3 billion invested through the third quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. The teams performance is creating value for our customers, communities and investors, and we continue to expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Additionally, as we announced in this morning's press release, we're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share. This range is anchored in the continued execution of our growth strategy and enhanced by our recent successful debt refinancing.
Moving to some highlights of our progress in the third quarter. In our Gas segment, we filed a base rate case in Indiana, seeking our first base rate increase there in more than 25 years. In Maryland, we received approval of our base rate case settlement. And in Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in our pending application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. On the customer growth front, we've seen good results from our increased efforts and remain on track to achieving sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020. In our electric segment, our latest electric modernization tracker update was approved and our proposed settlement related to the coal combustion residuals environmental upgrades remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our electric transmission projects are on track and are expected to be in service in mid-2018.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,540315229,1327651,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at Slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through",741,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at Slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first 9 months of 2017, our non-GAAP net operating earnings are up about $44 million or $0.12 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers. As we discussed previously, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an aftermarket or ATM equity issuance program.
During the third quarter, we issued about 10.6 million shares, receiving proceeds of about $281 million. Consistent with the financing plan outlined at Investor Day, this fulfills our 2017 plan to raise $200 million to $300 million in equity.
On the debt financing side, we issued $750 million in 30-year long-term notes at 3.95% in September. This is our second issuance this year after issuing $2 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes in May. The pricing of the notes this year has helped us establish new benchmark pricing for long dated notes, providing better clarity going forward for both NiSource and our investors as we expect to be in a market every year to fund our modernization program.
I would remind everyone that our debt and equity issuances are intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all expected financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings guidance as well as our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment reported an operating loss of about $17 million in the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $5 million for the comparable period in 2016.
Net revenues were up about $20 million, driven primate by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by an approximately $43 million increase in operating expenses, which I will touch on later.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $129 million in the quarter, an increase of about $24 million from the comparable period of 2016. Net revenues were up about $34 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by approximately $10 million -- by a $10 million increase in operating expenses.
As I mentioned previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked own and expenses is largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, liability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we remain confident that our performance transformation plan will lead to flat own and expenses following this year.
Early success and our performance transformation plan as our IT service provider transitions well underway and work teams charged with identifying and implementing process improvement opportunities. These opportunities will further integrate the n and Colombia companies, while enhancing value adding activities for our customers.
Full details of our third quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30, was about $8.7 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower and 4 years longer than its separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. And as always, we remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit and our ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,540315229,1327651,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. I'll start with a recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance.

I'll start with a recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we remained to the Dow Jones sustainability North America Index, and I'm proud to say we were the second-highest ranked U.S. multi-utility on the list. Our ranking reflects advancements we made to our sustainability strategy in 2016 by outlining aggressive but achievable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. These reductions are enabled by the planned retirement of 50% of our coal-fired electric generation fleet and by our ongoing accelerated replacement of our natural gas distribution infrastructure. We're proud to be included in this index because of its recognition of our deep commitment to serving customers in a way that is safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable.
On the customer growth front, we're well ahead of where we were at the same point in 2016, which turned out to be our best year for customer growth in a decade. This progress is driven by a continued rebound in new home construction and conversions to natural gas, keeping us on track to achieve sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020, and we continue to modernize training for our field operations employees. This month, we'll open the third of our 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in Chester, Virginia. The first two are already operating, one near Pittsburgh and one near Columbus, and a facility in Massachusetts will open in 2018. And I'd like to recognize our in NIPSCO employees and our business partners in Indiana who stepped up to help restore power in Florida following hurricane Irma in September. There's a long tradition of electric utilities helping each other following natural disasters and our team was more than 220 people, including NIPSCO employees in line in 3 contractors, headed south to help get energy flowing again to affected customers and communities.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier in Indiana, we filed a gas base rate case, which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, new rates would be phased in and would increase annual revenues by nearly $144 million, including amounts currently, being recovered through various trackers. An order as expected in the second half of 2018.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement with stakeholders in our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program, which remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This well-established program currently authorized through the end of 2017, covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. A final order is expected by the end of the year.
New rates went into effect last week in Maryland, following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement in our base rate case. The outcomes supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and will result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million.
In Indiana, we're continuing to execute on our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. New rates under NIPSCO's semiannual tracker update took effect July 1. And in late August, we filed our latest semiannual tracker update, covering approximately $58 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2017. The investments are designed to further improve system reliability and safety. Tracker updates are also pending in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia, which combined, include approximately $160 million of investments.
Before moving on from our gas business update, I want to highlight some improving results from the most recent J.D. Power residential natural gas study. Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as one of the nation's top gas-only brands and ranked #2 in the nation on customer service. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania were among the top 5 brands in the East and Columbia Gas of Ohio was #4 in the Midwest. Our strong performance across the board demonstrates continued progress on our commitment to top-tier customer satisfaction.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And just yesterday, we received IURC approval of our second semiannual tracker update request, which covers about $133 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with the anticipated in-service dates in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV be and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.
Substation line and tower construction continues to progress for both projects. In our environmental settlement agreement, seeking approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Shafer generating stations remains pending before the IURC. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these unit's impact on the local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of the year.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. For 2017, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share and to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. We're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and 2018 capital investment guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

As we look at the potential impacts from the loss of interest deductibility and being 100% expensing of capital, certainly has the negative impact on our plan. But I think as we think about it, we've got a number of levers to help mitigate any risk from that, both in our capital plan. In the past, when we've had 100% bonus depreciation, we have accelerated our modernization spend in our infrastructure trackers to help offset that lower rate base impact. O&M certainly is a lever we have, we've already started our transformation efforts, I mean, have committed to flat O&M after 2017, but that it's another lever that we have that we can items in short term to help mitigate that and spread off any impact of, negative impact of tax reform. And then finally, our financing. We typically finance long-term, mostly 30-year debt and 10-year debt, and so certainly have flexibility to go shorter-term to help smooth out any negative impact of tax reform. So we're paying attention and looking closely but certainly, as everyone else is really want to understand what the details are of what may come out of tax reform."

NiSource continues to make progress on our customer-focused business plan, delivering on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer growth programs while enhancing our capabilities through transformation initiatives.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our achievements so far this year. We delivered third quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.07 compared to a $0.06 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest an estimated $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in utility infrastructure this year with more than $1.3 billion invested through the third quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. The teams' strong steady performance is creating value for our customers, communities and investors, and we continue to expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Additionally, as we announced in this morning's press release, we're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share. This range is anchored in the continued execution of our growth strategy and enhanced by our recent successful debt refinancing.
Moving to some highlights of our progress in the third quarter. In our Gas segment, we filed a base rate case in Indiana, seeking our first base rate increase there in more than 25 years. In Maryland, we received approval of our base rate case settlement. And in Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in our pending application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. 
On the customer growth front, we've seen good results from our increased efforts and remain on track to achieving sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020. In our electric segment, our latest electric modernization tracker update was approved and our proposed settlement related to the Coal Combustion Residuals environmental upgrades remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our electric transmission projects are on track and are expected to be in service in mid-2018.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Throug",737,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Looking at Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first 9 months of 2017, our non-GAAP net operating earnings are up about $44 million or $0.12 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers. As we've discussed previously, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program.
During the third quarter, we issued about 10.6 million shares, receiving proceeds of about $281 million. Consistent with the financing plan outlined at Investor Day, this fulfills our 2017 plan to raise $200 million to $300 million in equity.
On the debt financing side, we issued $750 million in 30-year long-term notes at 3.95% in September. This is our second issuance this year after issuing $2 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes in May. The pricing of the notes this year has helped us establish new benchmark pricing for long-dated notes providing better clarity going forward for both NiSource and our investors as we expect to be in the market every year to fund our modernization program.
I would remind everyone that our debt and equity issuances are intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all expected financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings guidance as well as our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment reported an operating loss of about $17 million in the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $5 million for the comparable period in 2016.  Net revenues were up about $20 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by an approximately $43 million increase in operating expenses, which I will touch on later.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $129 million in the quarter, an increase of about $24 million from the comparable period of 2016. Net revenues were up about $34 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by approximately $10 million -- by a $10 million increase in operating expenses.
As I mentioned previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses is largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, liability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we remain confident that our performance transformation plan will lead to flat O&M expenses following this year.
Early success in our performance transformation plan has our IT service provider transition well underway and work teams charged with identifying and implementing process improvement opportunities. These opportunities will further integrate the NIPSCO and Columbia companies while enhancing value-adding activities for our customers.  Full details of our third quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30, was about $8.7 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower and 4 years longer than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. And as always, we remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit and our ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,540315229,1327914,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and I",1046,"Thanks for that update, Donald. 
I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and I'm proud to say we were the second-highest ranked U.S. multi-utility on the list. Our ranking reflects advancements we made to our sustainability strategy in 2016 by outlining aggressive but achievable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. These reductions are enabled by the planned retirement of 50% of our coal-fired electric generation fleet and by our ongoing accelerated replacement of our natural gas distribution infrastructure. We're proud to be included in this index because of its recognition of our deep commitment to serving customers in a way that is safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable.
On the customer growth front, we're well ahead of where we were at the same point in 2016, which turned out to be our best year for customer growth in a decade. This progress is driven by a continued rebound in new home construction and conversions to natural gas, keeping us on track to achieve sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020, and we continue to modernize training for our field operations employees. This month, we'll open the third of our 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in Chester, Virginia. The first 2 are already operating, 1 near Pittsburgh and 1 near Columbus, and a facility in Massachusetts will open in 2018. And I'd like to recognize our NIPSCO employees and our business partners in Indiana, who stepped up to help restore power in Florida following Hurricane Irma in September. There's a long tradition of electric utilities helping each other following natural disasters, and our team was more than 220 people, including NIPSCO employees in line and 3 contractors, headed south to help get energy flowing again to affected customers and communities.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter from our Gas Operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we filed a gas base rate case, which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, new rates would be phased in and would increase annual revenues by nearly $144 million, including amounts currently being recovered through various trackers. An order is expected in the second half of 2018.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement with stakeholders in our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program, which remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This well-established program currently authorized through the end of 2017, covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. A final order is expected by the end of the year.
New rates went into effect last week in Maryland, following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement in our base rate case. The outcome supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and will result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million.
In Indiana, we're continuing to execute on our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. New rates under NIPSCO's semiannual tracker update took effect July 1. And in late August, we filed our latest semiannual tracker update covering approximately $58 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2017. The investments are designed to further improve system reliability and safety. Tracker updates are also pending in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia, which combined, include approximately $160 million of investments.
Before moving on from our gas business update, I want to highlight some improving results from the most recent J.D. Power Residential Natural Gas study. Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as  one of the nation's top gas-only brands and ranked #2 in the nation on customer service. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania were among the top 5 brands in the East and Columbia Gas of Ohio was #4 in the Midwest. Our strong performance across the board demonstrates continued progress on our commitment to top-tier customer satisfaction.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And just yesterday, we received IURC approval of our second semiannual tracker update request, which covers about $133 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
Substation line and tower construction continues to progress for both projects. And our environmental settlement agreement seeking to -- seeking approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations remains pending before the IURC. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of the year.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. For 2017, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share and to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. We're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share in 2018 capital investment guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

Yes, as Joe said, we're paying attention, we're looking at what's going on and certainly engaging with legislators to promote our plan and our strategy and the impact that may have on our customers. As we look at the potential impacts from the loss of interest deductibility and the 100% expensing of capital, certainly, has a negative impact on our plan. But I think as we think about it, we've got a number of levers to help mitigate any risk from that, both in our capital plan. In the past, when we've had 100% bonus depreciation, we have accelerated our modernization spend in our infrastructure trackers to help offset that lower rate base impact. O&M certainly is a lever we have, we've already started our transformation efforts and have committed to flat O&M after 2017. But that is another lever that we have that we can do items in the short term to help mitigate that and spread off any impact of -- negative impact of tax reform. And then finally, we -- our financing. We typically finance long term, mostly 30-year debt and 10-year debt, and so certainly have flexibility to go shorter term to help smooth out any negative impact of tax reform. So yes, we're paying attention and looking closely, but certainly, as everyone else is, we really want to understand what the details are of what may come out of tax reform."

So we went from about 83% funded to about 97% funded. Assuming we hit our assumed returns on our contributions, we don't expect that we'll need to make contributions going forward.

NiSource continues to make progress on our customer-focused business plan, delivering on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer growth programs while enhancing our capabilities through transformation initiatives.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our achievements so far this year. We delivered third quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.07 compared to a $0.06 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest an estimated $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in utility infrastructure this year with more than $1.3 billion invested through the third quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. The teams' strong steady performance is creating value for our customers, communities and investors, and we continue to expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Additionally, as we announced in this morning's press release, we're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share. This range is anchored in the continued execution of our growth strategy and enhanced by our recent successful debt refinancing.
Moving to some highlights of our progress in the third quarter. In our Gas segment, we filed a base rate case in Indiana, seeking our first base rate increase there in more than 25 years. In Maryland, we received approval of our base rate case settlement. And in Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in our pending application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. 
On the customer growth front, we've seen good results from our increased efforts and remain on track to achieving sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020. In our electric segment, our latest electric modernization tracker update was approved and our proposed settlement related to the Coal Combustion Residuals environmental upgrades remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our electric transmission projects are on track and are expected to be in service in mid-2018.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Throug",737,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Looking at Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first 9 months of 2017, our non-GAAP net operating earnings are up about $44 million or $0.12 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers. As we've discussed previously, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program.
During the third quarter, we issued about 10.6 million shares, receiving proceeds of about $281 million. Consistent with the financing plan outlined at Investor Day, this fulfills our 2017 plan to raise $200 million to $300 million in equity.
On the debt financing side, we issued $750 million in 30-year long-term notes at 3.95% in September. This was our second issuance this year after issuing $2 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes in May. The pricing of the notes this year has helped us establish new benchmark pricing for long-dated notes providing better clarity going forward for both NiSource and our investors as we expect to be in the market every year to fund our modernization program.
I would remind everyone that our debt and equity issuances are intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all expected financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings guidance as well as our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment reported an operating loss of about $17 million in the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $5 million for the comparable period in 2016.  Net revenues were up about $20 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by an approximately $43 million increase in operating expenses, which I will touch on later.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $129 million in the quarter, an increase of about $24 million from the comparable period of 2016. Net revenues were up about $34 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by approximately $10 million -- by a $10 million increase in operating expenses.
As I mentioned previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses is largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, liability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we remain confident that our performance transformation plan will lead to flat O&M expenses following this year.
Early success in our performance transformation plan has our IT service provider transition well underway and work teams charged with identifying and implementing process improvement opportunities. These opportunities will further integrate the NIPSCO and Columbia companies while enhancing value-adding activities for our customers.  Full details of our third quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30, was about $8.7 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower and 4 years longer than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. And as always, we remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit and our ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance.

I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and I'm proud to say we were the second-highest ranked U.S. multi-utility on the list. Our ranking reflects advancements we made to our sustainability strategy in 2016 by outlining aggressive but achievable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. These reductions are enabled by the planned retirement of 50% of our coal-fired electric generation fleet and by our ongoing accelerated replacement of our natural gas distribution infrastructure. We're proud to be included in this index because of its recognition of our deep commitment to serving customers in a way that is safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable.
On the customer growth front, we're well ahead of where we were at the same point in 2016, which turned out to be our best year for customer growth in a decade. This progress is driven by a continued rebound in new home construction and conversions to natural gas, keeping us on track to achieve sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020, and we continue to modernize training for our field operations employees. This month, we'll open the third of our 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in Chester, Virginia. The first 2 are already operating, 1 near Pittsburgh and 1 near Columbus, and a facility in Massachusetts will open in 2018. And I'd like to recognize our NIPSCO employees and our business partners in Indiana, who stepped up to help restore power in Florida following Hurricane Irma in September. There's a long tradition of electric utilities helping each other following natural disasters, and our team with more than 220 people, including NIPSCO employees in line and 3 contractors, headed south to help get energy flowing again to affected customers and communities.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter from our Gas Operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we filed a gas base rate case, which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, new rates would be phased in and would increase annual revenues by nearly $144 million, including amounts currently being recovered through various trackers. An order is expected in the second half of 2018.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement with stakeholders in our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program, which remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This well-established program currently authorized through the end of 2017, covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. A final order is expected by the end of the year.
New rates went into effect last week in Maryland, following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement in our base rate case. The outcome supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and will result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million.
In Indiana, we're continuing to execute on our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. New rates under NIPSCO's semiannual tracker update took effect July 1. And in late August, we filed our latest semiannual tracker update covering approximately $58 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2017. The investments are designed to further improve system reliability and safety. Tracker updates are also pending in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia, which combined, include approximately $160 million of investments.
Before moving on from our gas business update, I want to highlight some improving results from the most recent J.D. Power Residential Natural Gas study. Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as  one of the nation's top gas-only brands and ranked #2 in the nation on customer service. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania were among the top 5 brands in the East and Columbia Gas of Ohio was #4 in the Midwest. Our strong performance across the board demonstrates continued progress on our commitment to top-tier customer satisfaction.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And just yesterday, we received IURC approval of our second semiannual tracker update request, which covers about $133 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
Substation line and tower construction continues to progress for both projects. And our environmental settlement agreement seeking to -- seeking approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations remains pending before the IURC. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of the year.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. For 2017, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share and to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. We're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share in 2018 capital investment guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Alex?"

Yes, as Joe said, we're paying attention, we're looking at what's going on and certainly engaging with legislators to promote our plan and our strategy and the impact that may have on our customers. As we look at the potential impacts from the loss of interest deductibility and the 100% expensing of capital, certainly, has a negative impact on our plan. But I think as we think about it, we've got a number of levers to help mitigate any risk from that, both in our capital plan. In the past, when we've had 100% bonus depreciation, we have accelerated our modernization spend in our infrastructure trackers to help offset that lower rate base impact. O&M certainly is a lever we have, we've already started our transformation efforts and have committed to flat O&M after 2017. But that is another lever that we have that we can do items in the short term to help mitigate that and spread off any impact of -- negative impact of tax reform. And then finally, we -- our financing. We typically finance long term, mostly 30-year debt and 10-year debt, and so certainly have flexibility to go shorter term to help smooth out any negative impact of tax reform. So yes, we're paying attention and looking closely, but certainly, as everyone else is, we really want to understand what the details are of what may come out of tax reform."

NiSource continues to make progress on our customer-focused business plan, delivering on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer growth programs while enhancing our capabilities through transformation initiatives.
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our achievements so far this year. We delivered third quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.07 compared to a $0.06 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest an estimated $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in utility infrastructure this year with more than $1.3 billion invested through the third quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. The teams' strong steady performance is creating value for our customers, communities and investors, and we continue to expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.
Additionally, as we announced in this morning's press release, we're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share. This range is anchored in the continued execution of our growth strategy and enhanced by our recent successful debt refinancing.
Moving to some highlights of our progress in the third quarter. In our Gas segment, we filed a base rate case in Indiana, seeking our first base rate increase there in more than 25 years. In Maryland, we received approval of our base rate case settlement. And in Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in our pending application for a 5-year extension of our long-term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. 
On the customer growth front, we've seen good results from our increased efforts and remain on track to achieving sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020. In our electric segment, our latest electric modernization tracker update was approved and our proposed settlement related to the Coal Combustion Residuals environmental upgrades remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our electric transmission projects are on track and are expected to be in service in mid-2018.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Throug",737,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Looking at Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first 9 months of 2017, our non-GAAP net operating earnings are up about $44 million or $0.12 per share compared with the same period in 2016.
The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers. As we've discussed previously, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program.
During the third quarter, we issued about 10.6 million shares, receiving proceeds of about $281 million. Consistent with the financing plan outlined at Investor Day, this fulfills our 2017 plan to raise $200 million to $300 million in equity.
On the debt financing side, we issued $750 million in 30-year long-term notes at 3.95% in September. This was our second issuance this year after issuing $2 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes in May. The pricing of the notes this year has helped us establish new benchmark pricing for long-dated notes providing better clarity going forward for both NiSource and our investors as we expect to be in the market every year to fund our modernization program.
I would remind everyone that our debt and equity issuances are intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all expected financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings guidance as well as our growth rate commitments through 2020.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment reported an operating loss of about $17 million in the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $5 million for the comparable period in 2016.  Net revenues were up about $20 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by an approximately $43 million increase in operating expenses, which I will touch on later.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $129 million in the quarter, an increase of about $24 million from the comparable period of 2016. Net revenues were up about $34 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by approximately $10 million -- by a $10 million increase in operating expenses.
As I mentioned previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses is largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, liability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we remain confident that our performance transformation plan will lead to flat O&M expenses following this year.
Early success in our performance transformation plan has our IT service provider transition well underway and work teams charged with identifying and implementing process improvement opportunities. These opportunities will further integrate the NIPSCO and Columbia companies while enhancing value-adding activities for our customers.  Full details of our third quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30, was about $8.7 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower and 4 years longer than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. And as always, we remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit and our ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,540315229,1329239,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and I",1046,"Thanks for that update, Donald. 
I'll start with the recognition NiSource received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and I'm proud to say we were the second-highest ranked U.S. multi-utility on the list. Our ranking reflects advancements we made to our sustainability strategy in 2016 by outlining aggressive but achievable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. These reductions are enabled by the planned retirement of 50% of our coal-fired electric generation fleet and by our ongoing accelerated replacement of our natural gas distribution infrastructure. We're proud to be included in this index because of its recognition of our deep commitment to serving customers in a way that is safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable.
On the customer growth front, we're well ahead of where we were at the same point in 2016, which turned out to be our best year for customer growth in a decade. This progress is driven by a continued rebound in new home construction and conversions to natural gas, keeping us on track to achieve sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020, and we continue to modernize training for our field operations employees. This month, we'll open the third of our 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in Chester, Virginia. The first 2 are already operating, one near Pittsburgh and one near Columbus, and a facility in Massachusetts will open in 2018. And I'd like to recognize our NIPSCO employees and our business partners in Indiana, who stepped up to help restore power in Florida following Hurricane Irma in September. There's a long tradition of electric utilities helping each other following natural disasters, and our team with more than 220 people, including NIPSCO employees in line and 3 contractors, headed south to help get energy flowing again to affected customers and communities.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter from our Gas Operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we filed a gas base rate case, which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, new rates would be phased in and would increase annual revenues by nearly $144 million, including amounts currently being recovered through various trackers. An order is expected in the second half of 2018.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement with stakeholders in our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program, which remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This well-established program currently authorized through the end of 2017, covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. A final order is expected by the end of the year.
New rates went into effect last week in Maryland, following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement in our base rate case. The outcome supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and will result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million.
In Indiana, we're continuing to execute on our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. New rates under NIPSCO's semiannual tracker update took effect July 1. And in late August, we filed our latest semiannual tracker update covering approximately $58 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2017. The investments are designed to further improve system reliability and safety. Tracker updates are also pending in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia, which combined, include approximately $160 million of investments.
Before moving on from our gas business update, I want to highlight some improving results from the most recent J.D. Power Residential Natural Gas study. Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as  one of the nation's top gas-only brands and ranked #2 in the nation on customer service. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania were among the top 5 brands in the East and Columbia Gas of Ohio was #4 in the Midwest. Our strong performance across the board demonstrates continued progress on our commitment to top-tier customer satisfaction.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And just yesterday, we received IURC approval of our second semiannual tracker update request, which covers about $133 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
Substation line and tower construction continues to progress for both projects. And our environmental settlement agreement seeking to -- seeking approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations remains pending before the IURC. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of the year.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. For 2017, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share and to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. We're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share in 2018 capital investment guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

So I'm not going to speculate about the implications of the current process just other than to say, we'll stay engaged and keep stakeholders informed.

Yes, as Joe said, we're paying attention, we're looking at what's going on and certainly engaging with legislators to promote our plan and our strategy and the impact that may have on our customers. As we look at the potential impacts from the loss of interest deductibility and the 100% expensing of capital, certainly, has a negative impact on our plan. But I think as we think about it, we've got a number of levers to help mitigate any risk from that, both in our capital plan. In the past, when we've had 100% bonus depreciation, we have accelerated our modernization spend in our infrastructure trackers to help offset that lower rate base impact. O&M certainly is a lever we have, we've already started our transformation efforts and have committed to flat O&M after 2017. But that is another lever that we have that we can do items in the short term to help mitigate that and spread off any impact of -- negative impact of tax reform. And then finally, we -- our financing. We typically finance long term, mostly 30-year debt and 10-year debt, and so certainly have flexibility to go shorter term to help smooth out any negative impact of tax reform. So yes, we're paying attention and looking closely, but certainly, as everyone else is, we really want to understand what the details are of what may come out of tax reform."

Of the $140 million-plus rate increase you've requested, how much of that would actually drop to the bottom line versus be offset by your just simply moving revenue from trackers to base rates or higher costs, like higher O&M or higher DNA?"
